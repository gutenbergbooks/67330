<div class="sidenote">Relation
of scholastic
theology
to our
theme.</div>

<p>The names of Peter Abelard, 1079-1142, and Hugh or
Hugo of St. Victor, 1096-1141, have been coupled as those
of the two men who perhaps more than any others were the
founders of scholastic theology. Our investigation is not
very closely or directly concerned with scholastic theology,
which I hope to show did not so exclusively absorb the intellectual
energy of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries as
has sometimes been asserted. Our attention will be mainly
devoted as heretofore to the pursuit of natural science during
that period and the prominence both of experimental method
and of magic in the same. But our investigation deals not
only with magic and experimental science, but with their
relation to Christian thought. It is therefore with interest
that we turn to the works of these two early representatives
of scholastic theology, and inquire what cognizance, if any,
they take of the subjects in which we are especially interested.
As we proceed into the later twelfth and thirteenth
centuries in subsequent chapters, we shall also take occasion
to note the utterances of other leading men of learning
who speak largely from the theological standpoint, like John
of Salisbury and Thomas Aquinas. Let us hasten to admit
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
also that the scholastic method of instruction and writing
made itself felt in natural science and medicine as well as
in theology, as a number of our subsequent chapters will illustrate.
In the present chapter we shall furthermore be
brought again into contact with the topic of the <i>Physiologus</i>
and Latin Bestiaries, owing to the fact that a treatise of
this sort has been ascribed, although probably incorrectly,
to Hugh of St. Victor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Character
of Abelard’s
learning.</div>

<p>There is no more familiar, and possibly no more important,
figure in the history of Latin learning during the
twelfth century than Peter Abelard who flourished at its
beginning. His career, as set forth in his own words, illustrates
educational conditions in Gaul at that time. His
brilliant success as a lecturer on logic and theology at Paris
reveals the great medieval university of that city in embryo.
His pioneer work, <i>Sic et Non</i>, set the fashion for the standard
method of presentation employed in scholasticism. He
was not, however, the only daring and original spirit of his
time; his learned writings were almost entirely in those
fields known as patristic and scholastic; and, as in the case
of <i>Sic et Non</i>, consist chiefly in a repetition of the utterances
of the fathers. This is especially true of his statements
concerning astrology, the <i>magi</i>, and demons. To
natural science he gave little or no attention. Nevertheless
his intellectual prominence and future influence make it advisable
to note what position he took upon these points.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Incorrect
statements
of his
views.</div>

<p>Although not original, his views concerning the stars
and their influences are the more essential to expose, because
writers upon Abelard have misunderstood and consequently
misinterpreted them. Joseph McCabe in his Life of Abelard,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
for instance, asserts that Abelard calls mathematics
diabolical in one of his works. And Charles Jourdain in his
in some ways excellent<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> <i>Dissertation sur l’état de la philosophie
naturelle en occident et principalement en France
pendant la première moitié du XIIe siècle</i>, praises Abelard
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
for what he regards as an admirable attack upon and criticism
of astrology in his <i>Expositio in Hexameron</i>, saying,
“It will be hard to find in the writers of a later age anything
more discriminating on the errors of astrology.”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Jourdain
apparently did not realize the extent to which Abelard was
simply repeating the writers of an earlier age. However,
Abelard’s presentation possesses a certain freshness and
perhaps contains some original observations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
nature of
the stars.</div>

<p>In the passage in question<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Abelard first discusses the
nature of the stars. He says that it is no small question
whether the planets are animated, as the philosophers think,
and have spirits who control their motion, or whether they
hold their unvarying course merely by the will and order
of God. Philosophers do not hesitate to declare them rational,
immortal, and impassive animals, and the Platonists
call them not only gods but gods of gods, as being more
excellent and having greater efficacy than the other stars.
Moreover, Augustine says in his <i>Handbook</i> that he is uncertain
whether to class the sun, moon, and stars with the
angels. In his <i>Retractions</i> Augustine withdrew his earlier
statement that this world is an animal, as Plato and other
philosophers believe, not because he was sure it was false,
but because he could not certainly prove it true either by
reason or by the authority of divine scripture. Abelard does
not venture to state an opinion of his own, but he at least
has done little to refute a view of the nature of the heavenly
bodies which is quite favorable to, and usually was accompanied
by, astrology. Also he displays the wonted
medieval respect for the opinions of the philosophers in
general and the leaning of the twelfth century toward Plato
in particular.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Prediction
of natural
and contingent
events.</div>

<p>Abelard next comes to the problem of the influence of
the stars upon this earth and man. He grants that the
stars control heat and cold, drought and moisture; he accepts
the astrological division of the heavens into houses,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
in certain ones of which each planet exerts its maximum of
force; and he believes that men skilled in knowledge of the
stars can by astronomy predict much concerning the future
of things having natural causes. Astronomical observations
to his mind are very valuable not only in agriculture but in
medicine, and he mentions that Moses himself is believed to
have been very skilful in this science of the Egyptians. It
is only to the attempt to predict <i>contingentia</i> as distinguished
from <i>naturalia</i> that he objects. By <i>contingentia</i> he seems
to mean events in which chance and divine providence or
human choice and free will are involved. He gives as a
proof that astrologers cannot predict such events the fact
that, while they will foretell to you what other persons will
do, they refuse to tell you openly which of two courses you
yourself will pursue for fear that you may prove them wrong
by wilfully doing the contrary to what they predict. Or, if
an astrologer is able to predict such “contingent events,” it
must be because the devil has assisted him, and hence Abelard
declares that he who promises anyone certitude concerning
“contingent happenings” by means of “astronomy” is
to be considered not so much <i>astronomicus</i> as <i>diabolicus</i>.
This is the nearest approach that I have been able to find
in Abelard’s writings to McCabe’s assertion that he once
called mathematics diabolical. But possibly I have overlooked
some other passage where Abelard calls <i>mathematica</i>,
in the sense of divination, diabolical.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> In any case Abelard
rejects astrology only in part and accepts it with certain
qualifications. His attitude is about the average one of his
own time and of ages preceding and following.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Magi
and the
star.</div>

<p>Abelard speaks of the Magi and the star of Bethlehem in
a sermon for Epiphany.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> This familiar theme, as we have
seen, had often occupied the pens of the church fathers, so
that Abelard has nothing new to say. On the contrary, he
exhausts neither the authorities nor the subject in the passages
which he selects for repetition. His first point is that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
the Magi were fittingly the first of the Gentiles to become
Christian converts because they before had been the masters
of the greatest error, condemned by law with soothsayers to
death, and indebted for their “nefarious and execrable doctrine”
to demons. In short, Abelard identifies them with
magicians and takes that word in the worst sense. He is
aware, however, that some identify them not with sorcerers
(<i>malefici</i>) but with astronomers. He repeats the legend
from the spurious homily of Chrysostom which we have
already recounted<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> of how the magi had for generations
watched for the star, warned by the writing of Seth which
they possessed, and how the star finally appeared in the
form of a little child with a cross above it and spake with
them. He also states that they were called <i>magici</i> in their
tongue because they glorified God in silence, without appearing
to note that this is contrary to his previous use of
<i>magi</i> in an evil sense. Abelard believes that a new star
announced the birth of Christ, the heavenly king, although
he grants that comets, which we read of as announcing the
deaths of earthly sovereigns, are not new stars. He also
discusses without satisfactory results the question why this
new star was seen only by the Magi.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Demons
and
forces in
nature.</div>

<p>In a chapter “On the Suggestions of Demons” in his
<i>Ethica seu Scito te ipsum</i>,<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Abelard attempts to a certain
extent a natural explanation of the tempting of men by
demons and the arousing of lust and other evil passions
within us. In this he perhaps makes his closest approach
to the standpoint of natural science, although he is simply
repeating an idea found already in Augustine and other
church fathers. In plants and seeds and trees and stones,
Abelard explains, there reside many forces adapted to arouse
or calm our passions. The demons, owing to their subtle
ingenuity and their long experience with the natures of
things, are acquainted with all these occult properties and
make use of them for their own evil ends. Thus they sometimes,
by divine permission, send men into trances or give
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
remedies to those making supplications to them, “and often
when such cease to feel pain, they are believed to be cured.”
Abelard also mentions the marvels which the demons worked
in Egypt in opposition to Moses by means of Pharaoh’s
magicians.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Magic and
natural
science.</div>

<p>Evidently then Abelard believes both in the existence of
demons and of occult virtues in nature by which marvels
may be worked. Magic avails itself both of demonic and
natural forces. The demons are more thoroughly acquainted
with the secrets of nature than are men. But this does not
prove that scientific research is necessarily diabolical or
that anyone devoting himself to investigation of nature is
giving himself over to demons. The inevitable conclusion
is rather that if men will practice the same long experimentation
and will exercise the same “subtle ingenuity” as the
demons have, there is nothing to prevent them, too, from
becoming at last thoroughly acquainted with the natural
powers of things. Also magic, since it avails itself of natural
forces, is akin to natural science, while natural science
may hope some day to rival both the knowledge of the demons
and the marvels of magic. Abelard does not go on
to draw any of these conclusions, but other medieval writers
were to do so before very long.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hugh of
St. Victor.</div>

<p>Upon Hugh of St. Victor Vincent of Beauvais in the
century following looked back as “illustrious in religion and
knowledge of literature” and as “second to no one of his
time in skill in the seven liberal arts.”<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Hugh was Abelard’s
younger contemporary, born almost twenty years later
in Saxony in 1096 but dying a year before Abelard in 1141.
His uncle, the bishop of Halberstadt, had preceded him at
Paris as a student under William of Champeaux. When
Hugh, as an Augustinian canon, reached the monastery of
St. Victor at Paris, William had ceased to teach and become
a bishop. Hugh was himself chosen head of the school
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
in 1133. He is famous as a mystic, but also composed exegetical
and dogmatic works, and is noted for his classification
of the sciences. Edward Myers well observes in this
connection: “Historians of philosophy are now coming to
see that it betrays a lack of psychological imagination to be
unable to figure the subjective coexistence of Aristotelian
dialectics with mysticism of the Victorine or Bernardine type&mdash;and
even their compenetration. Speculative thought was
not, and could not be, isolated from religious life lived with
such intensity as it was in the middle ages, when that speculative
thought was active everywhere, in every profession,
in every degree of the social scale.”<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Later, in the case of
St. Hildegard of Bingen, we shall meet an even more striking
combination of mysticism and natural science.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Character
of the
<i>Didascalicon</i>.</div>

<p>Of Hugh’s writings we shall be chiefly concerned with
the <i>Didascalicon</i>, or <i>Eruditio didascalica</i>,<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> a brief work
whose six books occupy some seventy columns in Migne’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
<i>Patrologia</i>. It is especially devoted, as its first chapter
clearly states, to instructing the student what to read and
how to read. On the whole, especially for its early twelfth
century date, it is a clear, systematic, and sensible treatise,
which shows that medieval men were wider readers than
has often been supposed and that they had some sound ideas
on how to study. In order to have a basis for systematic
study, Hugh describes and classifies the various arts and
sciences, mechanical and liberal, theoretical and practical.
He is possibly influenced in his definitions and derivations
by Isidore’s <i>Etymologies</i>, although he seldom if ever acknowledges
the debt, whereas he cites Boethius a number of
times, but at least his classification and arrangement of material
are quite different from Isidore’s. In this description
and classification, and indeed throughout the treatise, Hugh
seems to display no little originality of thought and arrangement&mdash;once
he tells us of his own methods of study<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>&mdash;although
his facts and details are mostly familiar ones from
ancient authors and although he of course embodies generally
accepted notions such as the <i>trivium</i> and <i>quadrivium</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Meaning
of <i>physica</i>.</div>

<p>To the four subjects of the <i>quadrivium</i> he adds <i>physica</i>
or <i>physiologia</i>,<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> which he says “considers and investigates
the causes of things in their effects and their effects in their
causes.” He quotes from Vergil’s <i>Georgics</i>, (II, 479-)</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Whence earthquakes come, what force disturbs the deep,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Virtues of herbs, the minds and wraths of brutes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All kinds of fruits, of reptiles, too, and gems.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Thus <i>Physica</i> is more inclusive than the modern science of
Physics, while Hugh evidently does not employ it in the
specific sense of the art of medicine, of which the word
<i>physica</i> was sometimes used in the medieval period. Hugh
goes on to say that <i>Physica</i> is sometimes still more broadly
interpreted to designate natural philosophy in contrast to
logical and ethical philosophy. His quotation from the
<i>Georgics</i> also causes one to reflect on the prominent part
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
played in natural science from before Vergil to after Hugh
by the semi-human characteristics ascribed to animals and
the occult virtues ascribed to herbs and gems.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The study
of history.</div>

<p>Hugh’s attitude to history is interesting to note in passing.
In his classification of the sciences he does not assign
it a distinct place as he does to economics and politics, but
he shows his inchoate sense of the importance of the history
of science and of thought by attempting a list of the founders
of the various arts and sciences.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> In this connection he
adopts the theory of the origin of the Etruscans at present
in favor with scholars, that they came from Lydia. He
regards the study of Biblical or sacred history as the first
essential for a theologian, who should learn history from
beginning to end before he proceeds to doctrine and allegory.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
Four essential points to note in studying history in
Hugh’s opinion are the person, the event, the time, and the
place.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The two
mathematics:
astrology,
natural
and superstitious.</div>

<p>In discussing the <i>quadrivium</i> Hugh explains the significance
of the terms, <i>mathematica</i>, <i>astronomia</i>, and <i>astrologia</i>.
<i>Mathematica</i>, in which the first letter “t” has the aspirate,
denotes sound doctrine and the science of abstract quantity,
and embraces within itself the four subjects of the <i>quadrivium</i>.
In other words it denotes mathematics in our sense
of the word. But <i>matesis</i>, spelled without the aspirate, signifies
that superstitious vanity which places the fate of man
under the constellations.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Hugh thus allows for the common
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
use since the time of the Roman Empire of the word
<i>mathematicus</i> for an astrologer, and the frequent use of
<i>mathematica</i> in the sense of the Greek word <i>mantike</i> or divination.
He correctly states the Greek derivation of astrology
and astronomy and employs those words in just
about their modern sense. Astrology considers the stars
in order to determine the nativity, death, and certain other
events. For Hugh, however, it is not wholly a superstition,
but “partly natural science, partly a superstition,” since he
believes that the condition of the human body as well as of
other bodies depends upon the constellations, and that sickness
and health as well as storms or fair weather, fertility
and sterility, can be predicted from the stars, but that it is
superstitious to assert their control over contingent events
and acts of free will,&mdash;the same distinction as that made by
Abelard.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
superlunar
and
sublunar
worlds.</div>

<p>In an earlier discussion of the universe above and beneath
the moon<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Hugh had further emphasized the superiority
of the heavenly bodies and their power over earthly
life and nature. He distinguished three kinds of beings:
God the Creator (<i>solus naturae genitor et artifex</i>) who
alone is without beginning or end and truly eternal, the
bodies of the superlunar world which have a beginning but
no end and are called perpetual and divine, and sublunar and
terrestrial things which have both a beginning and an end.
The mathematicians call the superlunar world nature, and
the sublunar world the work of nature, because all life and
growth in it comes “through invisible channels from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
superior bodies.” They also call the upper world time, because
of the movements of the heavenly bodies in it determining
time, and the lower world temporal, because it is
moved according to the superior motions. They further call
the superlunar world Elysium on account of its perpetual
light and peace, while they call the other <i>Infernum</i> because
of its confusion and constant fluctuation. Hugh adds that
he has touched upon these points in order to show man that,
in so far as he shares in this world of change, he is like it,
subject to necessity, while in so far as he is immortal he is
related to the Godhead.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Discussion
of
magic.</div>

<p>Hugh’s brief, but clear and pithy, account of magic occurs
in the closing chapter of his sixth and last book,<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> and
seems to be rather in the nature of an <i>addendum</i>. It is,
indeed, missing from the <i>Didascalicon</i> in some of the earliest
manuscripts<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> and is found separately in the same collection
of manuscripts, so that possibly it is not by Hugh.
At any rate, magic is treated by itself apart from his previous
description and classification of the arts and sciences
and listing of their founders. The definition of magic makes
it clear why it is thus segregated: “Magic is not included
in philosophy, but is a distinct subject, false in its professions,
mistress of all iniquity and malice, deceiving concerning
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
the truth and truly doing harm; it seduces souls from
divine religion, promotes the worship of demons, engenders
corruption of morals, and impels the minds of its followers
to every crime and abomination.” Hugh had prefaced this
definition by much the usual meager history of the origin of
magic to be found in Isidore and other writers, but his definition
proper seems rather original in its form and in a way
admirable in its attitude. The ancient classical feeling that
magic was evil and the Christian prejudice against it as the
work of demons still play a large part in his summary of
the subject, but to these two points that magic is hostile to
Christianity or irreligious, and that it is improper, immoral,
and criminal, he adds the other two points that it is not a
part of philosophy&mdash;in other words, it is unscientific, and
that it is more or less untrue and unreal. Or these four
points may be reduced to two: since law, religion, and
learning unite in condemning magic, it is unsocial in
every respect; and it is more or less untrue, unreal, and
unscientific.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Five subdivisions
of magic.</div>

<p>Hugh’s list of various forbidden and occult arts which
are sub-divisions of magic is somewhat similar to that of
Isidore, but he classifies and groups them logically under
five main heads in a way which appears to be partly his own,
and which was followed by other subsequent writers, such as
Roger Bacon. His first three main heads all deal with arts
of divination. <i>Mantike</i> divides as usual into necromancy,
geomancy, hydromancy, aerimancy, and pyromancy. Under
<i>mathematica</i> are listed <i>aruspicina</i>, or the observation of
hours (<i>horae</i>) or of entrails (<i>hara</i>); augury, or observation
of birds; and <i>horoscopia</i>, or the observation of nativities.
The third main head, <i>sortilegia</i>, deals with divination by
lots. The fourth main head, <i>maleficia</i>, with which magic
has already been twice identified in the chapter, is now described
by Hugh as “the performance of evil deeds by incantations
to demons, or by ligatures or any other accursed
kind of remedies with the co-operation and instruction of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
demons.”<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Fifth and last come <i>praestigia</i>, in which “by
phantastic illusions concerning the transformation of objects
the human senses are deceived by demoniacal art.”<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>De bestiis
et aliis
rebus.</i></div>

<p>Among the doubtful and spurious works ascribed to
Hugh is a bestiary in four books,<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> in which various birds
and beasts are described, and spiritual and moral applications
are made from them. At least this is the character of the
first part of the treatise; towards the close it becomes simply
a glossary of all sorts of natural objects. <i>Physiologus</i>
is often cited for the natural properties of birds and beasts,
but as we have already dealt with the problem of the <i>Physiologus</i>
in an earlier chapter, and as we shall sufficiently deal
with the properties and natures ascribed to animals in the
middle ages in describing the treatment of them by various
encyclopedists like Thomas of Cantimpré, Bartholomew of
England, and Albertus Magnus, we are at present mainly
interested in some other features of the treatise before us.
It is often illustrated with illuminations of birds and animals
in the manuscripts and was originally intended to be
so, as the prologue on the hawk and dove by its monkish
author to a noble convert, Raynerus, makes evident. “Wishing
to satisfy the petitions of your desire, I decided to paint
the dove whose ‘wings are covered with silver, and her
feathers with yellow gold,’ and to edify minds by painting,
in order that what the simple mind can scarcely grasp by
the eye of the intellect, it might at least discern with the
carnal eye, and vision perceive what hearing could scarcely
comprehend. However, I wished not only to depict the dove
graphically but to describe it in words and to explain the
painting by writing, so that he whom the simplicity of the
picture did not please might at least be pleased by the morality
of Scripture.” Indeed, the work is often entitled <i>The Gilded
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
Dove</i> in the manuscripts. The treatise is manifestly of a religious
and popular rather than scientific character. One
interesting passage states that a monk should not practice
medicine because “a doctor sometimes sees things which are
not decent to see,” and “touches what it is improper for the
religious to touch.” Furthermore, a physician “speaks of
uncertain matters by means of experiments, but experience is
deceitful and so often errs. But this is not fitting for a monk
that he should speak aught but the truth.”<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> It is rather surprising

It should be noted, however, that
B. Hauréau, <i>Les Œuvres de
Hugues de Saint-Victor, Essai
critique, nouvelle edition</i>, Paris,
1886, demonstrated that there
should be only six books of the
<i>Didascalicon</i> instead of seven as
in this edition and that of 1648.
This will not affect our investigation,
as we shall make no use
of the seventh book, but we shall
have later to discuss whether a
passage on magic belongs at the
close of the sixth book or not.
There appears to be a somewhat
general impression that the edition
of 1648 is the earliest edition
of Hugh’s works, but the British
Museum has an undated incunabulum
of the “Didascolon” numbered
IB. 859, fol. 254.</p>

<p>Vincent of Beauvais in the thirteenth
century speaks of the
“Didascolon” as in five books
(<i>Speculum doctrinale</i>, XVIII, 62)
but is probably mistaken. The
MSS seem uniformly to divide the
work into a prologue and six
books, as in the following at Oxford:</p>

<p>New College 144, 11th (<i>sic</i>)
century, folio bene exaratus et
servatus, fols. 105-43, “Incipit prologus
in Didascalicon.”</p>

<p>St. John’s 98, 14th century, fol.
123-</p>

<p>Corpus Christi 223, 15th century,
fol. 73-</p>

<p>I have not noted what MSS of
the <i>Didascalicon</i> there are in the
British Museum. The following
MSS elsewhere may be worth
listing as of early date:</p>

<p>Grenoble 246, 12th century, fols.
99-133.</p>

<p>BN 13334, 12th century, fol.
52-, de arte didascalica, is probably
our treatise, although the
catalogue names no author.</p>

<p>BN 15256, 13th century, fol. 128-.</p>

<p>Still other MSS will be mentioned
in a subsequent note.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_16" href="#FNanchor_16" class="label">[16]</a> A similar distinction will be
found in the <i>Glosses on the Timaeus</i>
of William of Conches
(Cousin, <i>Ouvrages inédits d’Abélard</i>,
1836, p. 649), one of Hugh’s
contemporaries of whom we shall
presently treat. A little later in
the twelfth century John of Salisbury
(<i>Polycraticus</i>, II, 18) makes
the distinction between the two
<i>mateses</i> or mathematics lie rather
in the quantity of the penultimate
vowel “e”. In the thirteenth century
Albertus Magnus (<i>Commentary
on Matthew</i>, II, 1) also
distinguished between the two varieties
of mathematics according
to the length of the “e” in “<i>mathesis</i>”;
but he did not regard
the second variety as necessarily
superstitious, but as divination
from the stars which might be
either good or bad, like Hugh’s
<i>astrologia</i>.</p>

<p>Roger Bacon mentioned both
methods of distinction between the
true and false mathematics; but
statements in his different works
are not in agreement as to which
case it is in which the “e” is long
or short. In the <i>Opus Maius</i>
(Bridges, I, 239 and note) and
<i>Opus Tertium</i> (caps. 9 and 65)
he states that the vowel is short
in the true mathematics and long
in the superstitious variety; but
in other writings he took the opposite
view and declared that “all
the Latins” were wrong in thinking
otherwise (see Bridges, I,
239 note; Steele (1920) viii).</p>

<p>In a twelfth century MS at
Munich (CLM 19488, pp. 17-23)
a treatise or perhaps an excerpt
from some longer work, entitled
<i>De differentiis vocabulorum</i>, opens
with the words, “Scire facit
mathesis et divinare mathesis.”
Roger Bacon says (Steele, 1920,
p. 3), “Set glomerelli nescientes
Grecum ... ex magna sua ignorancia
vulgaverunt hos versus
falsos:</p>

<div class="sidenote">Place in
medieval
learning.</div>

<p>While the Breton, Abelard, and the Saxon, Hugh of St.
Victor, were reviewing patristic literature from somewhat
new angles and were laying the foundations of scholastic
method, an Englishman, Adelard of Bath,<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> was primarily
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
interested in exploring the fields of mathematical and natural
science. As Hugh came from Saxony to Paris and Abelard
went forth from his native Brittany through the towns of
France in quest of Christian teachers, so Adelard, leaving
not only his home in England but the schools of Gaul where
he had been teaching, made a much more extensive intellectual
pilgrimage even to lands Mohammedan. “It is worth
while,” he declares in one of his works, “to visit learned
men of different nations, and to remember whatever you
find is most excellent in each case. For what the schools
of Gaul do not know, those beyond the Alps reveal; what
you do not learn among the Latins, well-informed Greece
will teach you.”<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> Adelard seems to have devoted himself
especially to Arabian learning and to have made a number
of translations from the Arabic, continuing at the beginning
of the twelfth century that transfer of Graeco-Arabic science
which we have associated with the name of Gerbert
in the tenth century and which Constantinus Africanus carried
on in the eleventh century. Adelard himself hints that
some of his new ideas are not derived from his Arabian
masters but are his own, and Haskins has well characterized
him as a pioneer in the study of natural science.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Some
dates in
his career.</div>

<p>Adelard has been described as “a dim and shadowy
figure in the history of European learning,”<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> and the dates
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
of his birth and death are unknown. We possess, however,
a number of his works and some may be either approximately
or exactly dated. In the preface to his translation of
the astronomical tables of Al-Khowarizmi he seems to give
the year as 1126.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> The Pipe Roll for 1130 informs us that
Adelard received four shillings and six pence at that time
from the sheriff of Wiltshire. This suggests that he was in
the employ of the king’s court,<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> and his brief treatise on the
astrolabe seems to be dedicated to Prince Henry Plantagenet,<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
later Henry II, and to have been written between 1142
and 1146. It was probably one of his last works and in it he
mentions specifically three earlier works.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Two other writings,
which are the best known and apparently the most
original of his works, namely the <i>Questiones naturales</i> and
<i>De eodem et diverso</i>, may be dated approximately from the
fact that they are dedicated respectively to Richard, Bishop
of Bayeux from 1107 to 1133, and to William, Bishop of
Syracuse, who died in 1115 or 1116. Both works are addressed
to Adelard’s nephew, who is presumably the same
person in both cases, one in the form of a letter, the
other of a conversation, and both justify Adelard’s studies
in foreign lands. In an appendix to this chapter the question
when these two treatises were written and their relations
to each other will be discussed more fully.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mathematical
treatises.</div>

<p>The subjects of a majority of Adelard’s known works
and translations are mathematical or astronomical. The
most elementary is a treatise on the abacus, <i>Regule abaci</i>,<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
in which his chief authorities are Boethius and Gerbert and
he seems as yet unacquainted with Arabic mathematics.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span><a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
But most of the mathematical treatises extant under Adelard’s
name are from the Arabic, such as his translation of
Euclid’s <i>Elements</i>;<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> of the astronomical tables of Al-Khowarizmi&mdash;who
flourished under the patronage of the caliph
Al-Mamum (813-833)&mdash;“apparently as revised by Maslama
at Cordova,” under the title <i>Liber Ezich</i>; and, if by
a “Master A” Adelard is meant, of a treatise of the first
half of the twelfth century on the four arts of the quadrivium
and especially on astronomy, which is apparently also
a work of Al-Khowarizmi.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Some of the introductory
books on the quadrivium have been printed,<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> but “the astronomical
treatise has not yet been specially studied.”<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
One therefore cannot say how far it may indulge in astrology,
but we are told that Adelard translated from the
Arabic another “astrological treatise, evidently of Abu
Ma’ashar Dja’afar,”<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> or Albumasar. We have already
mentioned in another chapter the ascription to Adelard of
one Latin translation of the superstitious work of Thebit
ben Corat on astrological images, and in the present chapter
the treatise on the astrolabe for Henry Plantagenet.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Adelard
and
alchemy.</div>

<p>Adelard was interested in alchemy as well as astrology
and magic, if the attribution to him in a thirteenth century
manuscript<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> of the twelfth century version of the <i>Mappe
clavicula</i> is correct. We have seen that the original version
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
of that work was much older than Adelard’s time, but he
perhaps made additions to it, or translated a fuller Arabic
version. The occurrence of some Arabic and English words
in certain chapters of the later copies are perhaps signs of
his contributions. Berthelot, however, thought that few of
the new items in the twelfth century version originated with
Adelard and that many of the additions were taken by him,
or by whoever was responsible for the later version, from
Greek rather than Arabic sources.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Importance
of
the <i>Natural
Questions</i>.</div>

<p>Our attention will be devoted chiefly to the two treatises
by Adelard which we have already mentioned as the most
original of his works. Of these the <i>Natural Questions</i> are
evidently much more important than the <i>De eodem et diverso</i>,
which is largely taken up with a justification, in the
style of allegorical personification made so popular by Martianus
Capella and Boethius, and with much use of Plato’s
<i>Timaeus</i>, of the seven liberal arts against the five worldly
interests of wealth, power, ambition, dignities, and pleasure.
The <i>Natural Questions</i>, although put into a dramatic dialogue
form somewhat reminiscent of Plato, deal without
much persiflage with a number of concrete problems of
natural science to which definite answers are attempted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Occasion
of writing.</div>

<p>Adelard opens the <i>Natural Questions</i> with brief allusion
to the pleasant reunion with the friends who greeted him
upon his return to England in the reign of Henry I after
long absence from his native land for the sake of study.
After the usual inquiries had been made concerning one
another’s health and that of their friends, Adelard asked
about “the morals of our nation,” only to learn that “princes
were violent, prelates wine-bibbers, judges mercenary, patrons
inconstant, the common men flatterers, promise-makers
false, friends envious, and everyone in general ambitious.”
Adelard declared that he had no intention of conforming to
this wretched state of affairs, and when asked what he did
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
intend to do, since he would not practice and could not prevent
such “moral depravity,” replied that he intended to ignore
it, “for oblivion is the only remedy for insurmountable
ills.” Accordingly that subject was dropped, and presently
his nephew suggested and the others joined in urging that
he disclose to them “something new from my Arabian
studies.”<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> From the sordid practical world back to the
pure light and ideals of science and philosophy! Such has
been the frequent refrain of our authors from Vitruvius
and Galen, from Firmicus and Boethius on. It is further
enlarged upon by Adelard in the <i>De eodem et diverso</i>; it has
not quite lost its force even today; and parallels to Adelard’s
twelfth century lament on England’s going to the dogs may
be found in after-the-war letters to <i>The London Times</i> of
1919.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Arabic
versus
Gallic
learning.</div>

<p>The result of the request preferred by Adelard’s friends
is the present treatise in the form of a dialogue with his
nephew, who proposes by a succession of questions to force
his uncle to justify his preference for “the opinions of the
Saracens” over those of the Christian “schools of Gaul”
where the nephew has pursued his studies. The nephew
is described as “interested rather than expert in natural
science”<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> in the <i>Natural Questions</i>, while a passage in the
<i>De eodem et diverso</i> implies that his training in Gaul had
been largely of the usual rhetorical and dialectical character,
since Adelard says to him, “Do you keep watch whether
I speak aright, observing that modest silence which is your
custom amidst the wordy war of sophisms and the affected
locutions of rhetoric.”<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> In the <i>Natural Questions</i> the
nephew, as befits his now maturer years, has more to say,
raising some objections and stating some theories as well as
propounding his questions, but Adelard’s answers constitute
the bulk of the book. Beginning with earth and plants,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
the questions range in an ascending scale through the lower
animals to human physiology and psychology and then to
the grander cosmic phenomena of sea, air, and sky.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“Modern
discoveries.”</div>

<p>In agreeing to follow this method of question and answer
Adelard explains at the start that on account of the prejudice
of the present generation against any <i>modern</i><a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> discoveries
he will attribute even his own ideas to someone else,
and that, if what he says proves displeasing to less advanced
students because unfamiliar, the blame for this should be
attached to the Arabs and not to himself. “For I am aware
what misfortunes pursue the professors of truth among the
common crowd. Therefore it is the cause of the Arabs that
I plead, not my own.”<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> This is a very interesting passage
in more ways than one. Adelard appears as an exponent of
the new scientific school, stimulated by contact with Arabian
culture. He is confident that he has valuable new truth, but
is less confident as to the reception which it will receive.
The hostility, however, in the Latin learned world is not, as
one might expect, to Mohammedan learning. The process
of taking over Arabic learning has apparently already begun&mdash;as
indeed we have seen from our previous chapters&mdash;and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
Adelard’s Christian friends are ready enough to hear
what he has learned in Mohammedan lands and schools, although
of course they may not accept it after they have heard
it. But he fears that he “would not get a hearing at all,”
if he should put forward new views as his own. Indeed,
he himself shows a similar prejudice against other novelties
than his own in a passage in the <i>De eodem</i>, where he
speaks impatiently and contemptuously of “those who harass
our ears with daily novelties” and of “the new Platos and
Aristotles to whom each day gives birth, who with unblushing
front proclaim alike things which they know and of
which they know nothing, and whose supreme trust is in
extreme verbosity.”<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> Adelard of course regarded his own
new ideas as of more solid worth than these, but the fact
remains that he was not after all the only one who was interested
in promulgating novelties. Yet his justification for
writing the <i>De eodem</i> is the silence of “the science of the
moderns” compared with the fluency of the ancients, of
whose famous writings he has read “not all, but the greater
part.”<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> It is not necessary, of course, to regard this passage
and the preceding as inconsistent, but it is well to read the
one in the light of the other.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Medieval
work
wrongly
credited
to Greek
and Arab.</div>

<p>But let us return to the passage from the <i>Natural Questions</i>
and Adelard’s insinuation&mdash;slightly satirical no doubt,
but also in part serious&mdash;that he has fathered new scientific
notions of his own upon the Arabs. There is reason to think
that he was not the only one to do this. Not only were
superstitious and comparatively worthless treatises which
were composed in the medieval period attributed to Aristotle
and other famous authors, but this was also the case
with works of real value. Also the number is suspiciously
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
large of works of which the lost originals were supposedly
by Greek or Arabian authors but which are extant only in
later Latin “translations.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Illustrated
from the
history of
alchemy.</div>

<p>This point may be specifically illustrated for the moment
from the researches of Berthelot among alchemistic manuscripts,
which have demonstrated that Latin alchemy of the
thirteenth century was less superstitious and more scientific
than in previous periods, whether among the ancient Greeks
or more recent Arabs. He found but one treatise in Arabic
which contained precise and minute details about chemical
substances and operations. As a rule the Arabian alchemists
wrote “theoretical works full of allegories and declamation.”
For a long time several works, important in the history
of chemistry as well as of alchemy, were regarded as
Latin translations of the Arab, Geber. But Berthelot discovered
the Arabic manuscripts of the real Geber, which
turned out to be of little value and largely copied from
Greek authors. On the other hand, the Latin works which
had gone under Geber’s name were produced in the thirteenth
and fourteenth centuries by men who seem, like Adelard
of Bath, to have preferred to ascribe their own ideas to
the Arabs. Let us examine for a moment with Berthelot<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
the chief of these Latin treatises. It is a “a systematic
work, very well arranged. Its modest method of exposition”
differs greatly from “the vague and excessive promises
of the real Geber.” Much of the book possesses “a
truly scientific character” and “shows the state of chemical
knowledge with a precision of thought and expression unknown
to previous authors.” As for Adelard’s new ideas,
we may not regard them as so novel as they seemed to him,
nor estimate them so highly in comparison with ancient
Greek science as Berthelot did medieval compared with
Greek alchemy&mdash;much of Adelard’s thought may be derived
by him from those ancient writings in which he claims to
have read so widely&mdash;but they were probably as new to Adelard’s
Latin contemporaries as they were to himself.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Science
and
religion.</div>

<p>While Adelard’s English friends displayed no bigoted opposition
to the reception of Saracen science, the question
of science and religion is raised in another connection in
the very first of the questions concerning nature which the
nephew puts to his uncle. The nephew inquires the reason
for the growth of herbs from earth, asking, “To what else
can you attribute this save to the marvelous effect of the
marvelous divine will?” Adelard retorts that no doubt it
is the Creator’s will, but that the operation is also not without
a natural reason. This attitude of independent scientific
investigation is characteristic of Adelard. Again in
the fourth chapter when the nephew displays a tendency to
ascribe all effects to God indifferently as cause, Adelard objects.
He insists that he is detracting in no way from God,
whom he grants to be the source of all things, but he holds
that nature “is not confused and without system” and that
“human science should be given a hearing upon those points
which it has covered.” On the other hand he has no desire
in the present treatise to overstep the bounds of natural
science and enter the field of theology. When his nephew
towards the close wishes him to go on and discuss the problem
of God’s existence and nature, he wisely responds, “You
are now broaching a question to me where it is easier to
disprove what isn’t so than to demonstrate what is,”<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> and
that they had better go to bed and leave this big question for
another day and another treatise.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Reason
versus
authority.</div>

<p>Besides preferring the learning of Arabian and other
distant lands to the schools of Gaul, and favoring scientific
investigation rather than unquestioning faith, Adelard also
sets reason above authority. He not only complains of his
generation’s inborn prejudice against new ideas, but later
on, when his nephew proposes to turn his questions from
the subject of plants to that of animals, enters upon a longer
diatribe against scholastic reliance upon past authorities. “It
is difficult for me to discuss animals with you. For I learned
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
from my Arabian masters under the leading of reason; you,
however, captivated by the appearance of authority, follow
your halter. Since what else should authority be called than
a halter? For just as brutes are led where one wills by a
halter, so the authority of past writers leads not a few of
you into danger, held and bound as you are by bestial
credulity. Consequently some, usurping to themselves the
name of authority, have used excessive license in writing,
so that they have not hesitated to teach bestial men falsehood
in place of truth. For why shouldn’t you fill rolls of
parchment and write on both sides, when in this age you
generally have auditors who demand no rational judgment
but trust simply in the mention of an old title?”<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> Adelard
adds that those who are now reckoned authorities gained
credence in the first instance by following reason, asserts that
authority alone is not enough to convince, and concludes with
the ultimatum to his nephew: “Wherefore, if you want to
hear anything more from me, give and take reason. For I’m
not the sort of man that can be fed on a picture of a beefsteak.”<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Need of
the telescope
and
microscope
already
felt.</div>

<p>The history of natural philosophy and science has demonstrated
that the unaided human reason has not been equal
to the solution of the problems of the natural universe, and
that elaborate and extensive observation, experience, and
measurement of the natural phenomena are essential. But
exact scientific measurement was not possible with the unaided
human senses and required the invention of scientific
instruments. As Adelard says in <i>De eodem et diverso</i>, “The
senses are reliable neither in respect to the greatest nor the
smallest objects. Who has ever comprehended the space of
the sky with the sense of sight?... Who has ever distinguished
minute atoms with the eye?”<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> Notable natural
questions these, showing that the need of the telescope and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
microscope was already felt and that the discovery must in
due time follow!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Some
quaint
speculative
science.</div>

<p>We must not, therefore, unduly blame Adelard for placing,
like the Greek philosophers before him, somewhat excessive
trust in human reason and believing that “nothing is
surer than reason, nothing falser than the senses.”<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> But
in consequence much of his discussion is still in the speculative
stage, and uncle as well as nephew shows the influence
of dialectical training. Some quaint and amusing instances
may be given. Asked why men do not have horns
like some other animals, Adelard at first objects to the question
as trivial; but when his nephew urges the utility of
horns as weapons of defence, he replies that man has reason
instead of horns, and that, as a social as well as bellicose
animal, man requires weapons which he can lay aside in
times of peace.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> Asked why the nose, with its impurities,
is placed above the mouth, through which we eat, Adelard
answers that nothing in nature is impure, and that the nose
serves the head and so should be above the mouth which
serves the stomach.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> Such arguing from the fitness of
things and from design was common in the Greek philosophers
whom Adelard had read, and in judging his treatise
we must compare it with such books as the <i>Saturnalia</i> of
Macrobius which he cites,<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> the <i>Natural Questions</i> of Seneca,
Plato’s <i>Timaeus</i>, and the <i>Problems</i> of Aristotle,<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> rather than
with works of modern science.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Warfare,
science,
and
religion.</div>

<p>It is noteworthy, however, even in these two amusing
instances that the argument from design is questioned, while
the question about horns Adelard perhaps inserted as a sly
hit against the militarism of the feudal age. Little recked
he of the horrible substitutes for horns that twentieth century
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
warfare would work out with the aid of modern science.
The medieval church has too often been wildly accused
of persecuting natural scientists and it has been
erroneously stated that Roger Bacon dared not reveal the secret
of the mariner’s compass&mdash;which really was well known
before his time&mdash;for fear of being accused of magic.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> There
is somewhat more plausibility in the theory that he concealed
the invention of gunpowder from fear of the inquisition,<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
since there appears to have been a certain medieval
prejudice against inhuman war inventions, which historians
of artillery somewhat impatiently ascribe to “ignorance, religion,
and chivalry,” and which they hold prevented the use
of Greek fire in the west.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> At any rate in Adelard’s day the
Second Lateran Council attempted to prohibit the use of
military engines against men on the ground that they were
too murderous.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Specimens
of
medieval
scientific
curiosity.</div>

<p>Returning to the <i>Natural Questions</i>, we may note that,
like the <i>Problems</i> of Aristotle, they vary from such crude
queries as might occur to any curious person without scientific
training to others that imply some previous theory or
knowledge. A list of some of them will illustrate the scope
of the scientific curiosity of the time. When one tree is
grafted upon another, why is all the fruit of the nature of
the grafted portion? Why do some brutes ruminate; why
are some animals without stomachs; and why do some which
drink make no water? Why do men grow bald in front?
Why do some animals see better in the night than in the
day and why can a man standing in the dark see objects that
are in the light, while a man standing in the light cannot see
objects that are in the dark? Why are the fingers of the
human hand of unequal length and the palm hollow? Why
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
don’t babies walk as soon as they are born, and why are they
at first nourished upon milk, and why doesn’t milk agree
equally with old and young? Why do we fear dead bodies?<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
A number of questions are devoted to each of the topics,
vision, hearing, and heat, while the senses of taste, smell, and
touch are dismissed in a single question and answer.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Theory of
sound.</div>

<p>The discussion of sound and vision may be noted more
fully. The nephew has already learned from his Boethius
something similar to the wave theory of sound. He states
that when the air has been formed by the mouth of the
speaker and impelled by the tongue, it impresses the same
form upon that which is next to it, and that this process
is repeated over and over just as concentric circles are
formed when a stone is thrown into water.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> Vitruvius had
given the same explanation in discussing the acoustics of a
theater.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> But when the nephew asks his uncle how the
voice can penetrate an iron wall, Adelard replies that every
metal body, no matter how solid, has some pores through
which the air can pass.<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> Thus he appears to regard air as
the only substance which can transmit or conduct sound
waves. His notion that air can pass through solids reminds
one a little of the milder theory of Hero of Alexandria that
heat and light consist of material particles which penetrate
the interstices between the atoms composing air and water.<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
But it hardly seems as if Adelard could have derived <i>his</i>
notion from Hero, since the impermeability of metal vessels
to air is a fundamental hypothesis in many of the devices
of Hero’s <i>Pneumatics</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p><div class="sidenote">Theory of
vision.</div>

<p>Adelard’s theory of vision, that of extramission of “a
visible spirit,” is similar to that of Plato in the <i>Timaeus</i>,
by which he was not unlikely influenced. The visible spirit
passes from the brain to the eye through “concave nerves
which the Greeks call optic,” and from the eye to the object
seen and back again “with marvelous celerity.”<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> It would
be interesting to know certainly whether Adelard penned this
passage before John of Spain translated into Latin the <i>De
differentia spiritus et animae</i>, in which Costa ben Luca
speaks of “hollow nerves” from the brain to the eye through
which the <i>spiritus</i> passes for the purpose of vision.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> Apparently
Adelard was first, since the <i>Natural Questions</i> were
finished at some time between 1107 and 1133, while John
of Spain is said to have made his translation for Raymond
who was archbishop of Toledo from 1130 to 1150. Were
the manuscripts not so insistent in naming John as translator,<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
we might think that Adelard had translated the <i>De
differentia spiritus et animae</i>. Very possibly he had come
across it during his study with Arabian masters. But he
shows no acquaintance with the optical researches of Al-Hazen
or with the treatise on <i>Optics</i> ascribed to Ptolemy,
which last is extant only in the twelfth century Latin translation
by Eugene of Palermo, admiral of Sicily.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> However,
the fact that three other theories of vision than the
one which Adelard accepts are set forth by his nephew suggests
that the problem was attracting attention. Pliny’s
<i>Natural History</i> gave no theory of vision whatever, although
he listed various cases of extraordinary sight.
Boethius, on the other hand, briefly adverted to the opposing
theories of vision by extramission and intramission in the
first chapter of his work on music. As for the marvelous
celerity of the visible spirit, Augustine had enlarged upon
the vast distance to the sun and back traveled by the visual
ray in an instant or twinkling of an eye.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p><div class="sidenote">Deductive
reasoning
from hot
and cold,
moist and
dry.</div>

<p>Throughout the <i>Natural Questions</i> Adelard’s explanations
and answers are based in large measure upon the
familiar hypothesis of the four elements and of the four
qualities, hot and cold, dry and moist. When asked, for
instance, why all ruminating animals begin to lie down
with their hind legs, he explains that their scanty animal
heat is the cause of their ruminating to aid digestion, and
that there is more frigidity in their posterior members,
which are consequently heavier and so are bent first in reclining.
The nephew thinks that here he has caught his
uncle napping, and asks why is it then that in rising they
lift themselves first onto their hind legs. But Adelard is not
to be so easily nonplussed, and explains that after they have
lain down and rested, they feel so refreshed that they lift
their heavier limbs first.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> Again, asked why persons of
quick perception often have faulty memories, Adelard suggests
that a moist brain is more conducive to intelligence,
but a dry one to memory. Thus moist potter’s clay receives
impressions more readily but also easily loses them; what
is drier receives the impression with more difficulty but retains
it.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> In a third passage, Adelard explains his nephew’s
weeping in his joy at seeing his uncle safely returned by
the theory that his excessive delight overheated his brain
and distilled moisture thence.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Refinement
of
the four
elements
hypothesis.</div>

<p>Adelard, however, like Galen, Constantinus Africanus,
Basil, and other writers before him, finds it advisable to refine
the theory of the four elements. He is at pains in his answer
to the nephew’s very first question to explain that what
we commonly call earth is not the element earth, and that no
one ever touched the pure element water, or saw the elements
air and fire. Every particular object contains all four
elements and we deal in daily life only with compounds.
In an herb, for instance, unless there were fire, there would
be no growth upward; unless there were water or air, no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
spreading out; and without earth, no consistency. Moreover,
when Adelard is asked why some herbs are spoken of
as hot by nature, although all plants have more earth than
fire in their composition, he says that while earth predominates
quantitatively, efficaciously they are more fiery, just
as his green cloak is larger than his green emerald, but much
less potent.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> Thus comes in the theory of occult virtue
to help out the inadequate and unsatisfactory hypothesis of
four elements and four qualities. We shall find our subsequent
authors often resorting to the same explanation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Animal
intelligence
doubted.</div>

<p>Adelard may believe in the marvelous virtue of emeralds,
to which indeed he alludes rather inadvertently, but we do
not find in the <i>Natural Questions</i> any of the common tales
concerning remarkable animal sagacity or malice. This
may be mere accident or it may be due to his warning in
introducing the discussion of animals to give and take reason
only. However, the question is discussed whether the
brutes possess souls,<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> and he states that the common people
are sure that they do not, and that only philosophers assert
that animals have souls. This does not mean that their souls
are rational, however: either animals possess “neither intelligence
nor discretion but only opinion which is founded not
in the soul but in the body”; or perhaps they have “some
judgment why they seek and avoid certain things,” and
such discretion of sense as enables a dog to distinguish scents.
If they possess such animal souls, do these perish with the
body?</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
earth’s
shape and
center of
gravity.</div>

<p>Adelard is correctly informed as to the shape of the
earth and its center of gravity. Asked how the terrestrial
globe is upheld in the midst of space, he retorts that in a
round space it is evident that the center and the bottom are
the same.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> This thought is reinforced by the next question,
If there were a hole clear through the earth and a stone
were dropped in, how far would it fall? Adelard correctly
answers, Only to the center of the earth. The same question
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
is asked of Adelard by a Greek in the <i>De eodem et
diverso</i>, so that, in case we regard the <i>De eodem</i> as written
before the <i>Natural Questions</i>, it would appear that he had
not derived his conclusion in this matter from either the
Greeks or the Arabs. However, we have heard Plutarch
scoff at the statement that bars weighing a thousand talents
would stop falling at the earth’s center, if a hole were opened
up through the earth.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Indestructibility
of matter.</div>

<p>In a recent review of Sir William Ramsay’s <i>The Life
and Letters of Joseph Black, M.D.</i>, it is stated, “The nature
of the experiment he (Black) made is not now known, but
his tremendous comment on it was, ‘Nothing escapes!’
Have we here really the first glimmering of the great principle
of the indestructibility of matter which, with the associated
principle regarding energy, forms the foundation of
modern chemistry and physics?”<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> To this the answer is,
“No.” Adelard of Bath stated the indestructibility of matter
eight centuries earlier, and apparently not as the result
of any experiment. But his utterance was fuller and more
explicit than that of Black. “And certainly in my judgment
nothing in this world of sense ever perishes utterly, or
is less today than when it was created. If any part is dissolved
from one union, it does not perish but is joined to
some other group.”<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Also
stated by
Hugh of
St. Victor.</div>

<p>The indestructibility of matter is also stated by Adelard’s
contemporary, Hugh of St. Victor, who remarks in
the <i>Didascalicon</i> that of earthly things which have a beginning
and an end “it has been said, ‘Nothing in the universe
ever dies because no essence perishes.’ For the essences of
things do not change, but the forms. And when a form is
said to change, it should not be so understood that any existing
thing is believed to perish utterly and lose its being, but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
only to undergo alteration, either perchance so that those
things which were joined are separated, or those joined
which had been separated....”<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> Hugh was quite certainly
a younger man than Adelard, but it is not so certain
that the <i>Didascalicon</i> was written after the <i>Natural Questions</i>,
although it is probable. Or Hugh may have heard
Adelard lecture in Gaul or learned his view concerning the
indestructibility of matter indirectly. Or they both may
have drawn it independently from a common source.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Roger
Bacon’s
continuity
of universal
nature.</div>

<p>In an article entitled <i>Roger Bacon et l’Horreur du Vide</i><a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>
Professor Pierre Duhem advanced the thesis that in
place of the previous doctrine that nature abhors a vacuum
Roger Bacon was the first to formulate a theory of universal
continuity. This was an incorrect hypothesis, it is
true, but one which Professor Duhem believed to have served
the useful purpose of supplementing “the Peripatetic theory
of heavy and light” until the discovery of atmospheric pressure.
This theory developed in connection with certain problematical
phenomena of which this “experiment” is the chief
and typical case. If there be suspended in air a vessel of
water having a hole in the top and several narrow apertures
in the bottom, no water will fall from it as long as the
superior aperture is closed. Yet water is heavier than air
and according to the principles of Aristotle’s <i>Physics</i> should
fall to the ground. Writers before Roger Bacon, according
to Duhem, explain this anomaly by saying that the fall of
the water would produce a vacuum and that a vacuum cannot
exist in nature. But Bacon argues that a vacuum
cannot be the reason why the water does not fall, because
a vacuum does not exist; he then explains further that although
by their particular natures water tends downwards
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
and air upwards, by their nature as parts of the universe
they tend to remain in continuity. Duhem held that Roger
Bacon was the first to substitute this positive law of universal
continuity for the mere negation that a vacuum cannot
exist in nature.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Previously
stated by
Adelard.</div>

<p>Professor Duhem supported his case by citation of Greek,
Byzantine, and Arabic sources and by use of writings of
fourteenth century physicists available only in manuscripts.
But unfortunately for his main contention he overlooked
a remarkable passage written by Adelard of Bath over a
century before Roger Bacon. In the fifty-eighth chapter
of the <i>Natural Questions</i> the nephew says, “There is
still one point about the natures of waters which is unclear
to me.” He then asks his uncle to explain a water
jar, similar to that just described, which they had once seen
at the house of an enchantress. Adelard replies in his clear,
easy style, so different from the scholastic discussion in
Bacon’s corresponding passages. “If it was magic, the enchantment
was worked by violence of nature rather than of
waters. For although four elements compose the body of
this world of sense, they are so united by natural affection
that, as no one of them desires to exist without another, so
no place is or can be void of them. Therefore immediately
one of them leaves its position, another succeeds it without
interval, nor can one leave its place unless some other which
is especially attached to it can succeed it.” Hence it is futile
to give the water a chance to escape unless you give the air
a chance to enter. Be it noted that Adelard not only thus
anticipates the theory of universal continuity, but also in
the last clause of the quotation approaches the doctrine of
chemical affinity in the formation and disintegration of
molecules. Finally, he describes what actually occurs in the
experiment more accurately than Roger Bacon or the other
physicists cited by Duhem. “Hence it comes about that, if
in a vessel which is absolutely tight above an aperture is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
made below, the liquid flows out only interruptedly and with
bubbling. For as much air gets in as liquid goes out, and
this air, since it finds the water porous, by its own properties
of tenuity and lightness makes its way to the top of the
vessel and occupies what seems to be a vacuum.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Experiment
and
magic.</div>

<p>This detailed and accurate description of exactly what
takes place shows us Adelard’s powers of observation and
experiment at their best, and compares favorably with two
cruder examples of experimentation which he ascribes to
others. He states that it was discovered experimentally
which portion of the brain is devoted to the imagination
and which parts to reason and memory through a case in
which a man was injured in the front part of the head.<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
In the other instance some philosophers, in order to study
the veins and muscles of the human body, bound a corpse
in running water until all the flesh had been removed by the
current.<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> But the question remains, how often did Abelard
exercise his powers of accurate observation by actual experiments?
Certainly one thing is noteworthy, that the
best and almost sole experiment that he details is represented
by him as suggested by the magic water jar of an
enchantress. Thus we are once again impelled to the conclusion
that experimental method owes a considerable debt
to magic, and that magic owed a great deal to experimental
method.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Adelard
and Hero
of Alexandria.</div>

<p>We are also reminded of the association of similar
water-jars with thaumaturgy in the <i>Pneumatics</i> of Hero of
Alexandria.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> It will be noted that Adelard is content with a
single illustration of the principle involved, while Hero kept
reintroducing instances of it. And while Hero gave little
more than practical directions, Adelard gives a philosophical
interpretation of and scientific deduction from the experiment.
But he also describes what actually occurs more accurately,
admitting that some liquid will gradually flow out
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
even when the air-hole is kept closed. Here again, as in the
case of the theory of the penetration of the particles of one
substance between those of another mentioned in our paragraph
above on the theory of sound, it is difficult to say
whether Adelard was acquainted with Hero’s works. Probably
it is only chance that Hero’s <i>Pneumatics</i> seems to contain
almost exactly the same number of theorems as Adelard’s
<i>Natural Questions</i> has chapters.<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Attitude
to the
stars: <i>De
eodem et
diverso</i>.</div>

<p>It remains to consider Adelard’s attitude towards the
stars, which is very similar to that of Plato’s <i>Timaeus</i>.
We have already seen that he translated works of Arabic
astrology. Such a work as the tables of Al-Khowarizmi
evidently has an astrological purpose, enabling one to find
the horoscope accurately. In the <i>De eodem et diverso</i> he
calls the celestial bodies “those superior and divine animals,”
and “the causes and principle of inferior natures.” One who
masters the science of astronomy can comprehend not only
the present state of inferior things but also the past and the
future.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> The existence of music, says Adelard in another
passage, supplies philosophers with a strong argument for
their belief that “the soul has descended into the body from
the stars above.”<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> In the <i>De eodem et diverso</i> Adelard also
expresses the belief that from present phenomena the mind
can look ahead far into the future, and that the soul can
sometimes foresee the future in dreams.<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Attitude
to the
stars:
<i>Questiones
Naturales</i>.</div>

<p>In the <i>Natural Questions</i><a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> Adelard again alludes to the
stars as “those superior animals,” and when asked whether
they are animated replies that he deems anyone to be without
sense who contends that the stars are senseless, and that
to call those bodies lifeless which produce vitality in other
bodies is ridiculous. He regards “the bodies of the stars”
as composed of the same four elements as this world of inferior
creation, but he believes that in their composition
those elements predominate which conduce most to life and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
reason, and that the celestial bodies are more fiery than terrestrial
bodies. “But their fire is not harsh, but gentle and
harmless. It therefore follows that it is obedient to and in
harmony with sense and reason.” Their form, too, being
“full and round,” is especially adapted to reason. Finally,
if reason and foresight exist even in our dark and perturbed
lower world, how much more must the stars employ intelligence
in their determined and constant courses? When the
nephew proceeds to inquire what food the stars eat, since
they are animals, Adelard shows no surprise, but answers
that as diviner creatures they use a purer sustenance than we,
namely, the humidities of earth and water which, extenuated
and refined by their long upward transit, neither augment
the stars in weight nor dull their reason and prudence. But
when the nephew asks whether the <i>aplanon</i> or outermost and
immovable sphere of heaven should be called God or not,
Adelard answers that to assert this is in one sense philosophical
but in another, insane and abominable, and he then
avoids further discussion by terminating the treatise.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Astrology
in an
anonymous
work, perhaps
by
Athelardus.</div>

<p>For some reason, which I failed to discover, the catalogue
of the Cotton manuscripts in the British Museum, in
describing “a philosophical treatise concerning the principles
of nature, the power of celestial influences on minds and
morals, and other matters,”<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> states that “the author seems
to be Athelardus.” The treatise is perhaps of later date
than Adelard of Bath, but as it would be equally difficult
to connect it with any other of our authors, we will give
some account of it now. It seems to be incomplete as it
stands both at the beginning and end, but the main interest
in the portion preserved to us is astrological. Authorities
are cited such as Hermes Trismegistus, Theodosius,
Ptolemy, Apollonius of Thebes, “Albateni,” and “Abumaxar.”
Discussing the number of elements our author
states that medical men speak of the four parts of the inferior
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
world, fire, air, water, earth,<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> but that astrologers
make the number of the elements twelve, adding the eight
parts of the superior world.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> Later our author argues
further for astrological influence as against “the narrow
medical man who thinks of no effects of things except those
of inferior nature merely.”<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> Our author holds that forms
come from above to matter here below, and discusses the
influence of the sky on the generation of humans and metals,
plants and animals, and connects seven colors and seven
metals with the planets.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> He furthermore, in all probability
following Albumasar in this, asserts that the course of history
may be foretold by means of astrology and that different
religions go with different planets.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> The Jews are
under Saturn; the Arabs, under Venus and Mars, which
explains the warlike and sensual character of their religion;
the Christian Roman Empire, under the Sun and Jupiter.
“Ancient writers argue” and “present experience proves”<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>
that the Sun stands for honesty, liberality, and victory;
Jupiter, for peace, equity, and humanity. The constant
enmity between the Jews and Christians, and Moslems and
Christians, is explained by the fact that neither Mars nor
Saturn is ever in friendly relation with Jupiter. These three
religions also observe the days of the week corresponding
to their planets: the Christians, Sunday; the Moslems, Friday
or Venus’s day; the Jews, Saturday. Our author also
explains the worships of the Egyptians and Greeks by their
relation to signs of the zodiac.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Authorities
on
spirits.</div>

<p>Despite the allusion just mentioned to “the experience of
to-day,” our author perhaps shows too great a tendency to
cite authorities to be that Adelard of Bath who wished to
give and take reason and reproved his nephew for blind
trust in authority. In discussing the theme of spirits and
demons<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>&mdash;a different problem, it is true, from natural
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
questions&mdash;he thinks that “it is enough in these matters to
have faith in the authority of those who, divinely illuminated,
could penetrate into things divine by the purer vision
of the mind.” He proceeds to cite Apuleius and Trismegistus,
Hermes in <i>The Golden Bough</i>, “Apollonius” in <i>The
Secrets of Nature</i>, which he wrote alone in the desert, and
Aristotle who tells of a spirit of Venus who came to him in
a dream and instructed him as to the sacrifice which he
should perform under a certain constellation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Adelard’s
future
influence.</div>

<p>But I would close this chapter on Adelard not with superstition
from a treatise of dubious authenticity, but rather
with reaffirmation of the importance in the long history of
science of his brief work, the <i>Natural Questions</i>. Its probable
effects upon Hugh of St. Victor and Roger Bacon are
instances of its medieval influence to which we shall add in
subsequent chapters. But most impressive is the fact that
within such compact compass it considers so many problems
and topics that are still of interest to modern science. For
instance, its two concrete examples of the stone dropped
into a hole extending through the earth’s center and of the
magic water jar have been common property ever since.</p>

<p class="h2sub">THE PROBLEM OF DATING THE DE EODEM ET DIVERSO AND
QUESTIONES NATURALES AND OF THEIR RELATIONS TO
EACH OTHER</p>

<div class="sidenote">Difficulty
of the
problem.</div>

<p>It is a difficult matter to fix the date either of the <i>De
eodem et diverso</i> or of the <i>Questiones naturales</i>, and to
account satisfactorily for the various allusions to contemporary
events and to Adelard’s own movements which occur
in either. It is not even entirely certain which treatise was
written first, as neither contains an unmistakable allusion to
the other. On general grounds the <i>De eodem et diverso</i>
would certainly seem the earlier work, but there are some
reasons for thinking the contrary. It seems clear that not
many years elapsed between the composition of the two
works, but how many is uncertain. It is evident that the
<i>De eodem et diverso</i> must have been written by 1116 at the
latest in order to dedicate it to William, bishop of Syracuse.
But the <i>Questiones naturales</i> apparently might have been
dedicated to Richard, bishop of Bayeux, at almost any time
during his pontificate from 1107 to 1133, although probably
not long after 1116.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Before
what
queen did
Adelard
play the
<i>cithara</i>?</div>

<p>Professor Haskins would narrow down the time during
which the <i>De eodem et diverso</i> could have been written to
the years from about 1104 to 1109, with the single year
1116 as a further possibility. He says, “Adelard speaks of
having played the <i>cithara</i> before the queen in the course of
his musical studies in France the preceding year, and as
there was no queen of France between the death of Philip I
and the marriage of Louis VI in 1115, the treatise, unless
the bishop of Syracuse was still alive in 1116, would not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
be later than 1109.”<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> But may not the queen referred to
have been Matilda, the wife of Henry I?<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> She was a
patroness both of artists and of men of letters, and the Pipe
Roll for 1130 and the treatise on the astrolabe have shown
us that later, at least, it was the English royal family with
which Adelard, himself an Englishman, was connected. It
is of “Gaul,” not of “France” in the sense of territory subject
to the French monarch, that Adelard writes,<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> and
Normandy was of course under Henry’s rule after the
battle of Tinchebrai in 1106.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Circumstances
under
which the
<i>De eodem
et diverso</i>
was
written.</div>

<p>The <i>De eodem et diverso</i> takes the form of a letter<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>
from Adelard to his nephew, justifying his “laborious
itinerary” in pursuit of learning against the reproach of
“levity and inconstancy” made by the nephew, and stating
“the cause of my travel among the learned men of various
regions,” at which the nephew has time and again expressed
his astonishment, and the reasons for which his uncle has
kept concealed from him for two years.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> This letter seems
to have been written by Adelard in Sicily, since it is prefaced
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
with a dedication to William, bishop of Syracuse, and since
towards its close Adelard speaks of “coming from Salerno
into Graecia maior”<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>&mdash;a phrase by which he presumably
refers to the ancient Magna Graecia, or southern Italy, and
perhaps also Sicily. In the preceding year, however, Adelard
and his nephew had been together in Tours.<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> It thus
appears that the <i>De eodem</i> was written not very long after
Adelard set out on his quest for foreign learning, while he
was still in the Greek or semi-Greek learned society of
southern Italy and Sicily, and presumably before he had
come into contact with the science of the Saracens, which
he does not mention in the <i>De eodem et diverso</i>, although
traces of it undoubtedly lingered in Sicily. He writes as
if the idea had only comparatively recently come to him
“that he could much broaden his education, if he crossed
the Alps and visited other teachers than those of Gaul.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Different
situation
depicted
in the
<i>Natural
Questions</i>.</div>

<p>In the <i>Natural Questions</i>, on the other hand, he returns
to England after seven years, instead of a single year, of
separation from his nephew, after a visit to the principality
of Antioch,<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> and after a considerable period of study among
the Saracens or Arabs. It is rather natural, however, to
conclude that the same absence abroad is referred to in
both treatises, and that Adelard wrote <i>De eodem et diverso</i>
to his nephew after he had been absent a year, while the
<i>Natural Questions</i> was composed after his return at the
end of seven years. Thus six years would separate the two
treatises. But the <i>Natural Questions</i> depicts a different last
parting of uncle and nephew from that of <i>De eodem et diverso</i>.
It does not allude to their having been together in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
Tours seven years ago, but reminds the nephew how, when
his uncle took leave of him and his other pupils at Laon
seven years since, it was agreed between them that while
Adelard investigated Arabian learning, his nephew should
continue his studies in Gaul.<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> In the <i>De eodem et diverso</i>,
on the contrary, neither Laon nor the Arabs nor any such
agreement between uncle and nephew is mentioned. Rather,
the uncle seems to have at first kept secret the motives for
his crossing the Alps. It therefore may be that Adelard
had returned from Sicily to Gaul and had taught at Laon
for a short time before setting out on a longer period of
travel in quest of Arabian science. This would agree well
enough with his allusion to his nephew in the <i>De eodem et
diverso</i> as “still a boy,”<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> and the statement in the <i>Natural
Questions</i> that his nephew was “little more than a boy”<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>
when he parted from him seven years before. In this case
the <i>Natural Questions</i> would have been written more than
seven years after the <i>De eodem et diverso</i>. This is, I think,
the most tenable and plausible hypothesis.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Some apparent
indications
that the
<i>De eodem
et diverso</i>
was written
after
the <i>Natural
Questions</i>.</div>

<p>There are, it is true, one or two circumstances which
might be taken to indicate that the <i>De eodem et diverso</i> was
written after the <i>Questiones naturales</i>. In the sole manuscript
of the <i>De eodem</i> thus far known<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> it follows that
treatise, and its title <i>Of the same and different</i> might be
taken as a continuation with variations of the general line
of thought of the other treatise. But it is perhaps just because
some copyist has so interpreted its title that it is put
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
after the <i>Natural Questions</i> in this manuscript. At any rate
in the text itself Adelard gives another explanation of its
title, stating that it has reference to the allegorical figures,
Philosophia and Philocosmia, who address him in his vision,
and who, he says, are designated as <i>eadem</i> and <i>diversa</i> “by
the prince of philosophers,”&mdash;an allusion perhaps to some
of Aristotle’s pronouns.<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> Another curious circumstance
is that the problem, How far would a stone of great weight
fall, if dropped in a hole extending through the earth at the
center? occurs in both the <i>De eodem</i> and <i>Natural Questions</i>.<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>
In the latter the nephew puts the query to his uncle:
in the former a Grecian philosopher whom Adelard has been
questioning concerning the properties of the magnet in attracting
iron, in his turn asks Adelard this question. Now
in the <i>Natural Questions</i> Adelard’s answer is given, as if
the nephew had never heard it before, but in the <i>De eodem
et diverso</i> it is simply stated that the Greek “listened to my
explanation of this,” as if the nephew had already heard
the explanation from his uncle.<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">How long
had
Henry I
been
reigning?</div>

<p>In opening the <i>Natural Questions</i> Adelard states that
Henry I was reigning when he returned to England recently.
This statement, in Professor Haskins’ opinion, “would seem
to imply that he originally left England for his studies in
France before Henry’s accession.” I am not quite sure that
this inference follows, but if it does, may one not go a step
further and argue that Henry I had come to the throne since
Adelard parted from his nephew at Laon to investigate the
learning of the Arabs? Had Henry become king of England
while Adelard was still studying or teaching in northern
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
Gaul, he would almost certainly have heard of it, and
it would have been no news to him on his return from his
studies among the Arabs. If we accept this view, Adelard’s
return to England would be not later than 1107. But it
could scarcely be earlier, if he wrote and dedicated the
<i>Natural Questions</i> promptly after his arrival, of which he
speaks as a recent event in that work, since the dedicatee
did not become Bishop of Bayeux until 1107. And if the
<i>De eodem et diverso</i> was written more than seven years
before the <i>Natural Questions</i>, we should have to date it back
into the eleventh century, which would perhaps be too early
for its dedication to William, bishop of Syracuse. And to
put these two works so early is to leave a gap between them
and the other known dates of Adelard’s career, 1126, 1130,
and 1142-1146, and make the period of his literary productivity
quite a long one. He would have been quite a
graybeard when he wrote on the astrolabe for the juvenile
Henry Plantagenet. On the whole, therefore, I am inclined
to think that Henry I had been reigning for some
time when Adelard wrote the <i>Natural Questions</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His relation
to
his time.</div>

<p>Practically contemporary with Adelard of Bath and associated
like him with members of the English royal line
was William of Conches,<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> of whom we shall treat in the
present chapter. Like Adelard also he withdrew from the
schools of Gaul after teaching there for a time&mdash;longer apparently
than Adelard; like Adelard he followed the guidance
of reason and took an interest in natural science; like
him he employed the dramatic dialogue form in his works.
John of Salisbury, who studied grammar under William
of Conches and Richard Bishop (<i>l’Évêque</i>) from about
1138 to 1141,<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> represents those masters as successors to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
thorough-going educational methods and humanistic ideals
of Bernard of Chartres; but adds that later, when men
“preferred to seem rather than be philosophers, and professors
of the arts promised to transmit all philosophy to
their hearers in less than three or two years’ time, overcome
by the onslaught of the unskilled multitude, they ceased
teaching.”<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> William then seems to have entered the service
of Geoffrey Plantagenet, to whom as duke of Normandy as
well as count of Anjou we find William addressing his
<i>Dragmaticon</i> or <i>Dramaticus</i>, which takes the form of a dialogue
between them. It thus was written at some time between
1144 and 1150, the period when Geoffrey was duke
of Normandy.<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> His son, the future Henry II of England,
was in Normandy from 1146 to 1149, when William appears
to have been his tutor.<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> In the <i>Dragmaticon</i> William
praises Geoffrey for training his children “from a tender
age” in the study of literature,<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> and before the boy was
made duke of Normandy by his father in 1150 at the age
of seventeen William prepared for his perusal a collection
of moral extracts from such classical Latin authors as
Cicero, Seneca, Juvenal, Horace, Lucan, and Persius, entitled
<i>De honesto et utili</i>.<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> The last we hear of William
seems to be in 1154, under which date Alberic des Trois
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
Fontaines,<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> a thirteenth century chronicler, states that he
had attained a great reputation. He might well have lived
on for some time after that date, since his former associate,
Richard Bishop, was archdeacon of Coutances at the time
John of Salisbury wrote the <i>Metalogicus</i> in 1159, and survived
to become bishop of Avranches in 1171, dying only
in 1182. One infers, however, from John’s account that
William was no longer living in 1159.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Early life.</div>

<p>We may next look back upon the earlier events of
William’s life. In the <i>Dragmaticon</i> he speaks of having
been previously engaged in teaching “for twenty years and
more than that.” Still earlier he had been a student, presumably
under Bernard of Chartres, in which town it is
possible that much of his own teaching was done. John
of Salisbury, however, simply says of his studies with
William, “Straightway I betook me to the grammarian of
Conches,” while in another passage he mentions “my
teachers in grammar, William of Conches and Richard, surnamed
Bishop, now an archdeacon at Coutances.” Although
this passage might seem to suggest that William
taught at Conches, no one so far as I know has ever entertained
that supposition, and the chief dispute has been
whether he taught at Chartres or at Paris.<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> But that he
was born at Conches no one doubts, and he himself once
speaks somewhat satirically of his Norman dulness compared
to the lightning intelligences of some of his contemporaries.<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Writings.</div>

<p>The <i>Dragmaticon</i> was a revision of a work on philosophy
or natural philosophy composed in William’s
“younger days.”<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> He also appears to have commented
upon Boethius’ <i>Consolation of Philosophy</i>,<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> and to have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
written a gloss on the <i>Timaeus</i><a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> in which among other
things he dilates upon the perfection of certain numbers.
But our discussion will be almost exclusively concerned with
his much more influential <i>Philosophia</i> and its revised version,
<i>Dragmaticon</i>. We shall first examine the original
version.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Philosophia</i>:
general
character.</div>

<p>The original treatise touches on the fields of philosophy
and astronomy in a simple and elementary way, but with
considerable skill, if not originality, in the selection and
presentation of its subject-matter. William does not seem
acquainted with Arabic science except that he has read
Constantinus Africanus and from him derived the same
doctrine that the four elements are never found in a pure
state which we met in Adelard of Bath. William gives us
a Platonic interpretation of nature, in which nevertheless
he does not adhere at all closely to the <i>Timaeus</i>, interspersed
with not infrequent quotation from or reference to astronomical
works, classical literature, and the Bible and
church fathers. Indeed, he is always careful to allow for
divine influence in nature and for the statements of Scripture,
and to show that his theories do not contradict either.
In such passages his language is always reverent, and he
not infrequently alludes respectfully to what the saints have
to say (<i>sancti dicunt</i>) on the theme in hand. The body
of the treatise opens with definition of philosophy and statement
of its method of inquiry, after which the author argues
that the world was made by God and discusses the Trinity
at some length. He then discusses the topics of world-soul,
demons, and elements; next passes to various matters astronomical
and astrological concerning the sky and stars;
and finally treats of our lower world and of man.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Contemporary
education.</div>

<p>The work also contains, especially in the prefaces to
its different books but also in other passages, a number of
interesting allusions to contemporary learning and education.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
William frequently refers to the existence of other
scholars and furthermore makes it evident that this learned
society is not in its earliest stage. Its paradise period is
over; the evil has entered in among the good; the enemy
has sown tares amid the wheat. Education has become too
popular, and already the insincere and the incapable, the
charlatan and the unthinking mob, are cheapening and degrading
the ideals of the true philosopher. William speaks
of “many who usurp the name of teacher,”<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> and of “certain
men who have never read the works either of Constantinus
or of any other philosopher, who out of pride
disdain to learn from anyone, who from arrogance invent
what they do not know,”<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> and who actually insist that the
four qualities, hot, cold, moist, and dry, are elements. In
another passage William says, “Although we are aware
that many strive for an ornate style, few for accuracy of
statement, yet rejoicing not in the many but in the probity
of the few, we toil for truth alone.”<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> These are not all of
William’s complaints. Back in the world of feudalism,
crusades, and Holy Roman Empire which seems to many so
foreign, distant, and incomprehensible, he voices grievances
which are still those of the college or university professor
of to-day. The teacher is so occupied with classes that he
has little time for research and publication;<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> the vulgar
crowd has stolen philosophy’s clothing and left the essential
body of truth naked and vainly crying for covering,&mdash;a
figure borrowed from <i>The Consolation of Philosophy</i> of
Boethius without express acknowledgment,<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> but perhaps the
allusion was so familiar as not to require one; the truly
learned are in danger of the bite of envy; most teachers are
catering to their pupils and giving “snap courses” in order
to gain popularity; the elective system is a failure, since
the students, in the words of the Apostle, “after their own
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
lusts heap to themselves teachers having itching ears”;
academic freedom has become a thing of the past now that
masters are become flatterers of their students and students
judges of their masters, while “if there is anyone who does
maintain a magisterial air, he is shunned as if insane by
the meretricious scholars and is called cruel and inhuman.”<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>
All which agrees perfectly with John of Salisbury’s statement
why William had ceased teaching.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Good
and bad
demons.</div>

<p>William does not mention magic in his treatise, but the
fact that he does not condemn all demons indifferently is
perhaps worth noting as a departure from the usual patristic
view and as offering opportunity for an innocent variety of
necromancy. William, who attributes his classification to
Plato, distinguishes three sorts of demons. The first class,
existent in the ether betwixt firmament and moon, are rational,
immortal, ethereal animals, invisible and impassive,
whose function is blissful contemplation of the divine sun.
The second class, who dwell in the upper atmosphere near
the moon, are rational, immortal, aerial animals. They
communicate the prayers of men to God and the will of
God to men, either in person or through signs or dreams
and “by the closest aspiration of vocal warning.” They
are capable of feeling, and, devoting themselves to good
men, rejoice in their prosperity and suffer with them in
their adversity. Both of these first two classes of demons
are good,&mdash;<i>kalodaemones</i>. But the third class, who inhabit
the humid atmosphere near the earth and are rational, immortal,
watery animals, and capable of feeling, are in every
way evil,&mdash;<i>kakodaemones</i>. They are lustful, cohabit with
women, and envy and plot against mankind, for men, although
fallen from grace like these demons, can recover their
lost estate as the demons cannot.<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Astronomy
and
astrology.</div>

<p>William offers a rather novel and unusual explanation
of the difference in meaning between the terms “astronomy”
and “astrology,” stating that authorities on the subject
speak of the superior bodies in three ways, the fabulous, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
astrological, and the astronomical. The method by fable is
that employed by Aratus, Memroth (Nimrod the astronomer?),
and Hyginus (“Eginus”), who interpret the Greek
myths in an astronomical sense. Hipparchus and Martianus
Capella are representatives of the astrological method, which
treats of phenomena as they appear to exist in the heavens,
whether they are really so or not. Astronomy, on the
contrary, deals with things as they are, whether they seem
to be so or not. Exactly what he has in mind by this distinction
William fails to make any clearer as he proceeds,
but from the fact that he lists Julius Firmicus and Ptolemy
as instances of the astronomical method it would appear
that he included part at least of what we should call astrology
under “astronomy.” William cites yet other astronomical
authorities, advising anyone wishing to learn about the
Milky Way to read Macrobius, and for an explanation of
the signs of the zodiac to consult Helpericus (of Auxerre),
the ninth century compiler of a <i>Computus</i> which occurs with
fair frequency in the manuscripts.<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Extent
of the
influence
of the
stars.</div>

<p>William represents “Plato, most learned of all philosophers,”
as saying that God the Creator entrusted the task
of forming the human body to the stars and spirits which
He had first created, but reserved to Himself the making
of the human soul.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> This Christian interpretation or rather
perversion of Plato’s doctrine in the <i>Timaeus</i> is characteristic.
William accepts to the full the control of the
stars over nature and the human body, but stops there. Like
Adelard he states that the stars are composed of the same
four elements as earthly objects. The predominance in
their composition of the superior elements, fire and air,
accounts for their motion. Their motion heats the atmosphere
which in turn heats the element water, which is the
fundamental constituent in the various species of animals,
which further differ according to the admixture in them of
the other elements. Of the superior elements the birds of the
air have the most, and fish next. Of land animals choleric
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
ones, like the lion, possess most fire; phlegmatic ones, like
pigs, most water; and melancholic ones, like the cow and
ass, most earth. The human body is composed of an unusual
harmony of the four elements, to which Scripture
alludes in saying that “God formed man of the dust of the
earth.”<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> William also lists the natural qualities and
humors of each planet and its consequent influence for
good or evil. He believes that the ancient <i>astrologi</i> discovered
that Saturn is a cold star by repeatedly observing
that in those years when the Sun in Cancer burned the earth
less than usual, Saturn was invariably in conjunction with
it in the same sign. How Saturn comes to exert this chilling
influence William is less certain. He has already denied
the existence of the congealed waters above the firmament,
so that he cannot accept the theory that Saturn is cold because
of its proximity to them. He can only suggest that
its great distance from us perhaps explains why it heats less
than the other planets.<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> The good and evil influences of
the planets also come out in the astrological interpretation
of myth and fable. Thus Saturn is said to carry a scythe
because one who carries a scythe does more execution in
receding than in advancing. Jupiter is said in the fables
to have ousted his father Saturn because the approach of
the planet Jupiter increases the evil influence of Saturn.
Jupiter is said to have begotten divers children in adultery
because the conjunctions of that planet produce varied
effects upon earth; and Venus is said to have had adulterous
intercourse with Mars because the propinquity of the planet
Venus to the planet Mars renders the former less benevolent.
Mars is god of battle because the planet of that name
produces heat and drought which in their turn engender
animosity.<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> As the tides follow the phases of the moon,
so, William believes, a universal flood or conflagration may
be produced by the simultaneous elevation or depression of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
all the planets.<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> But he accepts comets as special signs
of the future caused by the Creator’s will instead of attempting
to give a natural explanation of the events which
follow them.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> This is perhaps because of their signifying
human events. Thunder and lightning are discussed without
mention of divination from them.<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Science
and
religion.</div>

<p>Thus far we have heard William cite authorities rather
than spurn them as Adelard did. He could, however, be
independent enough on occasion. He went so far as to
reject the Scriptural account of waters above the firmament,
if that word were taken in its ordinary astronomical sense,
as naturally impossible; he explained away the passage in
<i>Genesis</i> by interpreting the firmament to mean the air, and
the waters above it, the clouds.<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> Like Adelard, too, he several
times feels it essential to justify his views against the
possible criticism of an obscurantist religious party. Discussing
the Trinity, he insists that if anyone finds something
in his book which is not found elsewhere, it should
not on that account be stigmatized as heresy but only if it
can be shown to be against the Faith.<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> Thus he confirms
Adelard’s complaint that the present generation is prejudiced
against any modern discoveries. William, by the way, also
employs the word “modern.” Again, in affirming the physical
impossibility of reconciling the elements fire and earth,
he notes that someone may object that God could find a way.
To this he replies that “we do not place a limit upon divine
power, but we do say that of existing things none can do
it, nor in the nature of things can there be anything that
would suffice.”<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> In a third passage his indignation is fanned
to a white heat by those who say, “We do not know how
this is, but we know that God can do it.” “You poor fools,”
he retorts, “God can make a cow out of a tree, but has He
ever done so? Therefore show some reason why a thing
is so, or cease to hold that it is so.”<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> Elsewhere he yet
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
further dilates upon the unreasonableness of the opponents
of natural science, who are loath to have explained even
the natural facts given in the Bible but prefer to accept them
blindly, and who, “since they themselves are unacquainted
with the forces of nature, in order that they may have all
men as companions in their ignorance, wish them to investigate
nothing but to believe like rustics. We, on the
contrary,” continues William, “think that a reason should
be sought in every case, if one can be found.”<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> Thus he
vigorously echoes Adelard’s exhortation to give and take
reason, and his retort to the nephew’s suggestion that the
growth of plants from earth can be explained only as a
divine miracle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter of
William
of St.
Thierry
to St.
Bernard.</div>

<p>William, it turned out, was too original and bold in
some of his assertions concerning the Trinity and kindred
topics, which were not allowed to pass unchallenged. A
letter to St. Bernard from William, abbot of St. Thierry,<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>
shows the attitude of William of Conches’ opponents. The
abbot first says,&mdash;with the assumption of superior seriousness
and dignity characteristic through all time of conservatives,
bigots, and pompous persons subconsciously aware of
their own stupidity&mdash;that anyone who knows William of
Conches personally is aware of his levity and will not
take his vanities too seriously, and that he is to be classed
with Abelard in the presumptuousness of his opinions. The
abbot then devotes most of his letter to an attack upon
William’s discussion of the Trinity, taking umbrage at his
discussing questions of faith at all, especially upon a philosophical
basis, and at his distribution of the three faculties,
power, will, and wisdom, among the Three Persons. The
abbot more briefly objects to William’s physical account of
the creation of man, saying: “First he says that man’s body
was not made by God but by nature, and the soul was given
him by God afterwards, and forsooth that the body was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
made by spirits whom he calls demons and by the stars.”
This doctrine the abbot regards as on the one hand dangerously
close to the opinion “of certain stupid philosophers
who say that there is nothing but matter and the material,
and that there is no other God in the world than the concourse
of the elements and the system of nature”; and on
the other hand as manifestly Manichean, affirming that the
human soul is created by a good God but the body by the
prince of darkness. Finally the abbot complains that William
“stupidly and haughtily ridicules history of divine
authority,” and “interprets in a physical sense” the account
of the creation of woman from one of Adam’s ribs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Extent of
William’s
retraction
in the
<i>Dragmaticon</i>.</div>

<p>The effect of this theological attack upon William of
Conches can probably be discerned in the <i>Dragmaticon</i>.
There he states that it is his purpose to include “many essential
points” which were not contained in the earlier treatise,
and to omit those statements which he has since become
convinced are erroneous. He then proceeds to list and expressly
condemn certain statements in the earlier work as
contrary to the Catholic Faith, and he asks those readers
who have copies of that treatise to make these corrections
in it.<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> He accordingly retracts his assertion that in the
Trinity the Father represents power and the Holy Spirit
will, since there is no direct scriptural authority for this
view, but he still maintains that the Son is Wisdom on the
authority of the Apostle. He takes back his interpretation
of the words of the Prophet concerning Christ, “Who will
tell his generation?” as indicating merely the difficulty and
not the impossibility of solving that mystery. Finally he
reverts to the letter of Scripture in regard to the creation
of Eve.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reassertion
of
previous
views.</div>

<p>But this done, William becomes his old self again in the
remainder of the <i>Dragmaticon</i>. In the rôle of the philosopher
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
he argues at length with the duke whether Plato’s five
circles of the sky and division of spirits into <i>kalodaemones</i>
and <i>kakodaemones</i> is in agreement with the Christian
Faith. Later on, when the duke cites Bede against him in
regard to some astronomical point, he replies that in a pure
matter of faith he would feel obliged to accept Bede’s authority,
but that on a point of philosophy he feels perfectly
at liberty to disagree with him. This declaration of scientific
independence from patristic authority became a <i>locus
classicus</i> cited with approval by several writers of the next
century. Presently to our surprise we find William boldly
inquiring at what time of year the six days of creation occurred.
He also indulges as before in somewhat bitter reflections
upon the learned world of his day.</p>

<div class="sidenote">No denial
of science.</div>

<p>William, therefore, has had to withdraw some theological
opinions for which he could not show authority in
Scripture, and some other opinions wherein he disregarded
the literal meaning of the Bible. But except that he has
to agree to the miraculous account of the creation of the
first woman, he does not seem to have altered his views
concerning nature and philosophy, nor to have given up in
any way his scientific attitude or his astrological theories.
The theologians have forced him to conform in respect to
theology, but his retraction in that field takes the form of
a second edition of his treatise and a reaffirmation of his
astronomical and philosophical views. As Hauréau well
says, “He always believes in science, he still defends in the
name of science, in the accents, and by the method of the
scholar, everything in his former writings that has not been
condemned in the name of the Faith.... So it is no denial
of philosophy that has been won by the outcries of
William of St. Thierry and Walter of St. Victor;<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> those attacks
have resulted in merely intimidating the theologian.”<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p><div class="sidenote">William’s
future
influence.</div>

<p>Such attacks, moreover, had little or no success in lessening
William’s ultimate future influence. How utterly they
failed to intimidate astrologers may be inferred from the
much greater lengths to which William’s contemporary,
Bernard Silvester, went without apparently getting into any
trouble, and from the half-hearted arguments against the
art of John of Salisbury a little later in the century. As
Doctor Poole has already pointed out, even the <i>Philosophia</i>,
which William of St. Thierry censured and which William
of Conches himself modified, survived in its original and
unexpurgated version “to be printed in three several editions
as the production of the venerable Bede, of saint Anselm’s
friend, William of Hirschau, and of Honorius of Autun;
the taint of heresy plainly cannot have been long perceptible
to medieval librarians.”<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> Also the revised edition, or
<i>Dragmaticon</i>, “enjoyed a remarkable popularity, and a wide
diffusion attested by a multitude of manuscripts at Vienna,
Munich, Paris, Oxford, and other places.”<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> We shall find
William’s book much used and cited by the learned writers
of the following century, and a number of copies of it are
listed in the fifteenth century catalogue of the library of St.
Augustine’s Abbey, Canterbury. If then from the contemporary
and passing world of talk William retired disgusted
and discomfited to the shelter of ducal patronage, in the
enduring world of thought and letters he carved for himself
a lasting niche by his comparative intellectual courage,
originality, and thoroughness.</p>

“The dialogue was written therefore
some time, probably some
years, before Henry was of an age
to be knighted, in 1149; and we
shall certainly not be far wrong if
we place it about the year 1145.”
As, however, Henry was knighted
when only about sixteen, and as
the remark “quos ... studio
literarum tenera aetate imbuisti”
may be retrospective, and as one
can scarcely argue with any chronological
exactness from these
medieval phrases denoting time
of life&mdash;Henry, for example, is
addressed as “vir optime atque
liberalis” in the preface of the
collection of ethical maxims which
William made for him before he
was seventeen,&mdash;&mdash;it seems to me
that there is no sufficient reason
for fixing on 1145 as the date of
the <i>Dragmaticon</i>.</p>

<p class="h2sub">EDITIONS AND MANUSCRIPTS OF THE ORIGINAL AND OF THE
REVISED VERSION OF THE WORK OF WILLIAM OF
CONCHES ON NATURAL PHILOSOPHY</p>

<p>Although, as the ensuing bibliography will make apparent,
a variety of titles have been at one time or another applied
to the two versions of the work in question, we shall
refer to the original version as <i>Philosophia</i> and the revision
as <i>Dragmaticon</i>, which appear to be both the handiest and
the most correct appellations, although personally I should
prefer <i>Dramaticus</i> for the latter. The two works may perhaps
be most readily distinguished by their <i>Incipits</i>, which
are, for <i>Philosophia</i>, “Quoniam ut ait Tullius in prologo
rhetoricorum, Eloquentia sine sapientia ...”, and for
<i>Dragmaticon</i>, “Quaeris, venerande dux Normannorum et
comes Andagavensium, cur magistris nostri temporis minus
creditur quam antiquis....” The titles and the number
of books into which the work is divided differ a good deal
in different editions and manuscripts, and the catalogues of
manuscript collections sometimes do not identify the author.</p>

<p>First as to printed editions. <i>Philosophia</i> has been
printed three times as the work of three other authors.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Importance
of
medieval
translations.</div>

<p>Already we have treated of a number of Arabic works
of occult science which are extant in Latin translations, or
have mentioned men, important in the history of medieval
science like Constantinus Africanus or Adelard of Bath,
whose works were either largely or partly translations. In
future chapters we shall have occasion to mention other
men and works of the same sort. We have already seen,
too, that translations from the Greek were being made
all through the early middle ages and in the tenth century;
and we shall see this continue in the twelfth and thirteenth
centuries especially in connection with Galen, Aristotle, and
Ptolemy. We have also seen reasons for suspecting that
the Latin versions of certain works were older than the
so-called Greek originals, that works were sometimes translated
from Arabic into Greek as well as from Greek into
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
Arabic, and that there probably never were any Arabic
originals for some so-called translations from the Arabic
which are extant only in Latin. All this is not yet to mention
versions from Hebrew and Syriac or in French, Spanish,
and Anglo-Saxon. We have seen also in general how
important and influential in the history of medieval learning
was the work of the translator, and yet how complicated
and difficult to follow. Many names of translators are
mentioned in the medieval manuscripts: some, for instance,
who will not be treated of in the present chapter are: from
the Greek, Aristippus of Sicily, Bartholomew of Messina,
Burgundio of Pisa, Eugenius admiral of Sicily, Grumerus
of Piacenza, Nicolaus of Reggio, Stephen of Messina, and
William of Moerbeke; from the Arabic, Egidius de Tebaldis
of Parma, Arnold of Barcelona, Blasius Armegandus
or Ermengardus of Montpellier, Marcus of Toledo, the
canon Salio of Padua, John Lodoycus Tetrapharmacus,
Philip of Spain, Philip of Tripoli, Roger of Parma, Ferragius,
and so on. But not all such names of translators
can be correctly placed and dated, and many translations
remain anonymous in the manuscripts. Into this vast and
difficult field Jourdain’s work on the medieval translations
of Aristotle made but an entrance, and that one which now
needs amendment, and even such extensive bibliographical
investigations as those of Steinschneider have only made
rough charts of portions. Some detailed monographs on
single translators<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> and the like topics have been written, but
many more will be required before we shall have a satisfactory
general orientation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Plan
of this
chapter.</div>

<p>The subject of medieval translations as a whole of
course in any case lies in large part beyond the scope of our
investigation and would lead us into other literary and
learned fields not bearing upon experimental science and
magic. In the present chapter we shall further limit ourselves
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
to some translators of the twelfth century who chiefly
translated works of astrology from the Arabic and who,
although they themselves often came from other lands, were
especially active in Spain. One or two men will be introduced
who do not possess all these qualifications, but who
are related to the other men and works included in the
chapter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Transmission
of
Arabic
astrology.</div>

<p>Throughout the twelfth century from its first years to
its close may be traced the transit of learning from the
Arabic world, and more particularly from the Spanish
peninsula, to northwestern Europe. Three points may be
made concerning this transmission: it involves Latin translation
from the Arabic; the matter translated is largely
mathematical, or more especially astronomical and astrological
in character; finally, it is often experimental.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Walcher,
prior of
Malvern.</div>

<p>On the very threshold of the twelfth century, in addition
to Adelard of Bath to whom we have given a separate
chapter, we meet with another Englishman, Walcher, prior
of Malvern, whom we find associated with Peter Alphonso
or Pedro Alfonso, who apparently was a converted Spanish
Jew. Walcher’s experimental observations would seem to
have antedated his association with Pedro, since a chapter
headed, “Of the writer’s experience,”<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> in lunar tables which
he composed between 1107 and 1112, tells of an eclipse
which he saw in Italy in 1091 but could not observe exactly
because he had no clock (<i>horologium</i>) at hand to measure
the time, and of another in the succeeding year after his
return to England which he was able to observe more scientifically
with the aid of an astrolabe. In 1120 Walcher
translated into Latin, at least according to the testimony of
the manuscripts, an astronomical work by Pedro Alfonso
on the Dragon.<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> Pedro perhaps wrote the original in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
Hebrew or Spanish or translated it from the Arabic into
one of those languages, but we also know of his writing
in Latin himself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pedro
Alfonso.</div>

<p>This Pedro Alfonso seems to have been the same<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> who
in 1106 in his forty-fourth year was baptized at Huesca
with the name of his godfather, King Alfonso I of Aragon,
and who wrote the <i>Disciplina clericalis</i> and <i>Dialogi cum
Iudeo</i>. Indeed we find the <i>Disciplina clericalis</i> and <i>De
dracone</i> ascribed to him in the same manuscript.<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> In another
manuscript chronological and astronomical tables are
found under his name and the accompanying explanatory
text opens, “Said Pedro Alfonso, servant of Jesus Christ
and translator of this book.”<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> This expression is very
similar, as Haskins has pointed out, to a heading in a
manuscript of the <i>Disciplina clericalis</i>, “Said Pedro Alfonso,
servant of Christ Jesus, physician of Henry the first (<i>sic</i>)
king of the Angles, composer of this book.”<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> The experimental
pretensions and astrological leanings of the astronomical
treatise are suggested by Pedro’s statement that the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
science of the stars divides into three parts, marvelous in
reasoning, notable in the signification of events, and approved
in experience; and that the third part is the science
of the nature of the spheres and stars, and their significations
in earthly affairs which happen from the virtue of
their nature and the diversity of their movements, things
known by experiment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His letter
to the
Peripatetics.</div>

<p>In a manuscript at the British Museum<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> I have read
what seems to be a third astronomical treatise by Pedro
Alfonso, differing both from the preceding and from the
<i>De dracone</i>.<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> We meet as before the expression, “Said
Alfonso, servant of Jesus Christ and translator of this
book,”<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> and the emphasis upon experiment and astrology
continues. It will be noted further that in this treatise,
which takes the form of a letter to Peripatetics and those
nourished by the milk of philosophy everywhere through
France, Pedro is no longer connected with Englishmen,
although this manuscript, too, is in an English library.
After rehearsing the utility of grammar, dialectic, and
arithmetic, Pedro finally comes to astronomy, an art with
which “all of the Latins generally” are little acquainted, in
which he himself has long been occupied, and a portion of
which he presents to them as something rare and precious.
It has come to his ears that some seekers after wisdom are
preparing to traverse distant provinces and penetrate to
remote regions in order to acquire fuller astronomical
knowledge, and he proposes to save them from this inconvenience
by bringing astronomy to them. Apparently,
therefore, this letter to the Peripatetics and other students
of philosophy is simply the advertisement of, or preface to,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
a translation by Pedro of some astronomical or astrological
work, presumably from the Arabic.<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> It is accordingly
mainly devoted to a justification of the thorough study of
astronomy and astrology. Many persons, in Pedro’s opinion,
are simply too lazy to take the trouble to ground themselves
properly therein. Those who think they know all
about the subject because they have read Macrobius and a
few other authors are found wanting in a crisis,&mdash;a passage
meant doubtless as a hit at those who base their knowledge
of astronomy simply upon Latin authors. Pedro also
alludes to those who have been accustomed to regard themselves
as teachers of astronomy and now hate to turn pupils
again.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Experimental
method.</div>

<p>The contrast which Pedro draws, however, is not so
much between Latin and Arabic writings as it is between
dependence upon a few past authorities and adoption of
the experimental method. He argues that the principles
of astronomy were discovered in the first place only through
experimentation, and that today no one can understand
the art fundamentally without actual observation and experience.
He believes that astrology as well as astronomy
is proved by experience. “It has been proved therefore by
experimental argument that we can truly affirm that the
sun and moon and other planets exert their influences in
earthly affairs.”<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> Or, as he says in another passage, “And
indeed many other innumerable things happen on earth in
accordance with the courses of the stars, and pass unnoticed
by the senses of most men, but are discovered and
understood by the subtle acumen of learned men who are
skilled in this art.”<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> Pedro’s letter further includes some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
astrological medicine, interesting in connection with the
statement in another manuscript that he was the physician
of Henry I of England. In this context, too, he shows
familiarity with the translations from the Arabic of Constantinus
Africanus.<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Magic and
scepticism
in the
<i>Disciplina
clericalis</i>.</div>

<p>Pedro’s <i>Disciplina clericalis</i>,<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> although a collection of
oriental tales rather than a work of natural science,<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> contains
one or two passages of interest to us. Asked by a
disciple what the seven arts are, the master gives a list somewhat
different from the common Latin <i>trivium</i> and <i>quadrivium</i>,
namely, logic, arithmetic, geometry, physics, music,
and astronomy. As to the seventh there is some dispute,
he says. Philosophers who believe in divination make
necromancy the seventh; other philosophers who do not
believe in predictions substitute philosophy; while persons
who are ignorant of philosophy affirm that grammar is one
of the seven arts.<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> Thus while Pedro retains all four arts
of the <i>quadrivium</i>, he holds only to logic in the case of the
<i>trivium</i>, omitting rhetoric entirely and tending to substitute
physics and necromancy for it and grammar. This tendency
away from <i>belles-lettres</i> to a curriculum made up of logic
and philosophy, mathematical and natural science, also soon
became characteristic of Latin learning, while the tendency
to include necromancy as one of the liberal arts or natural
sciences, although less successful, will be found in other
writers who are to be considered in this chapter. In the
passage just discussed the importance of the number seven
also receives emphasis, as the master goes on to speak of
other sevens than the arts. One is impressed also in reading
the <i>Disciplina clericalis</i> by a sceptical note concerning
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
magic and the marvelous properties of natural objects, as
in the tale of the thief who repeated a charm seven times
and tried to take hold of a moonbeam, but as a result fell
and was captured, and in the tale of the Churl and the Bird,
who promised his captor, if released, to reveal three pieces
of wisdom.<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> The first was not to believe everyone. “This
saide,” in the quaint wording of the medieval English version,
“the litel brid ascendid vpon the tree and with a
sweete voice bigan to synge: ‘Blessid be god that hath
shit and closed the sight of thyn eyen and taken awey thi
wisdam, forwhi if thow haddest sought in the plites of myn
entrailes thow shuldest have founde a jacinct the weight
of an vnce.’” When the churl wept and beat his breast
at this announcement of his lost opportunity, the bird
again warned him not to be so credulous. “And how belivistow
that in me shuld be a jacynt the weight of an vnce,
whan I and al my body is nat of somoche weight?”</p>

<div class="sidenote">John of
Seville.</div>

<p>Apparently the chief and most voluminous translator of
astrological works from Arabic into Latin in the twelfth
century was John of Seville.<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> Although he translated some
other mathematical, medical, and philosophical treatises, the
majority of his translations seem to have been astrological,
and they remained in use during the later middle ages and
many of them appeared in print in early editions. So many
Johns<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> are mentioned in medieval manuscripts and even
wrote in almost the same fields as John of Seville that it is
not easy to distinguish his works. Jourdain identified him
with a John Avendeath or Avendehut (Joannes ibn David)
who worked with the archdeacon Gundissalinus under the
patronage of Raymond, archbishop of Toledo from 1126 to
1151.<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> John of Seville was perhaps not the man who worked
with Gundissalinus<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> but he certainly appears to have addressed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
translations to Archbishop Raymond. Thus in
speaking of Costa ben Luca’s <i>De differentia spiritus et animae</i>
we saw that the manuscripts stated that it was translated
by John of Seville from Arabic into Latin for Archbishop
Raymond of Toledo.<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> John of Seville is further
styled of Luna or Limia, in one manuscript as bishop of
Luna,<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> and also seems to be the same person as John of
Toledo or of Spain. In one of the citations of the <i>Speculum
astronomiae</i> of Albertus Magnus he is called “Joannes
Ulgembus Hispalensis.”<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> John Paulinus, who translated
a collection of twelve experiments with snakeskin entitled
<i>Life-saver</i> which he discovered when he “was in Alexandria,
a city of the Egyptians,” is in at least one manuscript
of his translation identified with John of Spain.<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Dates
in his
career.</div>

<p>Certain dates in the career of John of Seville may be
regarded as fairly well fixed. In the Arabic year 529, or
1135 A. D., he translated the <i>Rudiments of Astronomy</i> of
Alfraganus (Ahmed b. Muh. b. Ketîr el-Fargânî, or Al-Fargani)<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>;
in 1142 A. D. he compiled his own <i>Epitome of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
the Art of Astrology</i> or <i>Quadripartite Work of Judgments
of the Stars</i>,<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> consisting of <i>Isagoge in astrologiam</i>
and four books of judgments. In 1153 A. D. he translated
the <i>Nativities</i> of Albohali<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> (Yahyâ b. Gâlib, Abû Alî el-Chaiyât),
if we accept the “John of Toledo” who is said to
have translated that treatise as the same person as our John
of Spain.<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> John of Spain is sometimes said to have died in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
1157, but Förster argued that the Tarasia, queen of Spain,
to whom the medical portion of the pseudo-Aristotelian
<i>Secret of Secrets</i>, translated by John of Spain, was dedicated,
was not the queen of Portugal contemporary with
Archbishop Raymond of Toledo, but queen of Leon from
1176 to 1180; and in 1175 a monk of Mt. Tabor is called
Johannes Hispanus.<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> If a Vienna manuscript is correct in
saying that a marvelous cure for a sore heel which it contains
was sent to Pope Gregory by John of Spain, the pope
meant must be Gregory VIII (1187).<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> There is of course
no impossibility in the supposition that the literary career
of John of Spain extended from the days of Archbishop
Raymond to those of Gregory VIII or Queen Tarasia. Still
there is some doubt whether all the works extant under the
name John of Spain were composed by the same individual.<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Further
works
by him,
chiefly astrological.</div>

<p>Several books dealing with the science of judgments
from the stars by John of Spain are included in the bibliography
of deserving works of astrology in the <i>Speculum
Astronomiae</i> of Albertus Magnus, but are perhaps simply
sections of his <i>Epitome</i><a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> which, after discussing in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
<i>Isagoge</i> the natures of the signs and planets, takes up in
turn the four main divisions of judicial astrology, namely;
conjunctions and revolutions, nativities, interrogations, and
elections. John seems to have translated several astrological
treatises by Albumasar and Messahala (Mâ-sâ-allâh),
the treatise by Thebit ben Corat on astrological images of
which we have already treated, that by Abenragel (ʿAli b.
abî’l-Rigâl, abû’l-Hasan) on elections, and the <i>Introduction
to the Mystery of Judgments from the Stars</i> by Alchabitius
or Alcabitius<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> (ʿAbdelʿazîz b. ʿOtmân el-Qabîsî), which
should not be confused with his own somewhat similar
<i>Ysagoge</i>. Of other translations by John of Spain, such as
a portion of the <i>Secret of Secrets</i> of the Pseudo-Aristotle,
the twelve experiments with pulverized snakeskin, and
Costa ben Luca’s <i>De differentia spiritus et animae</i>, we treat
elsewhere. He was perhaps also the author of a chiromancy.<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">John’s experimental
astrology.</div>

<p>The experimental character of John’s own handbook on
astrology is worth noting. In the main, it is true, he follows
the works of the philosophers and astrologers of the
past, especially when he finds them in agreement.<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> Besides
constantly alluding to what astrologers in general or the
ancients say on the point in question, he often cites of the
Greeks Ptolemy and Dorotheus (“Dorothius”) and Hermes
and Doronius, but probably through Arabic mediums.
He also gives us the views of the masters of India, and distinguishes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
as “more recent masters of this art”<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> the Arabic
writers “Alchindus” and Messahala. The latter he seems to
regard as an Indian or at least as skilful in their methods
of judgment.<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> But he also notes when his authorities are
in disagreement<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> or points out that his own experience in
many nativities contradicts their views,<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> against which John’s
readers are warned when they find them in the books of
judgments. Even Ptolemy is twice criticized on the basis
of actual experiment.<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> We see that John was not merely
a translator or writer on astrology but an expert practitioner
of the art. He supplements the divergent views of past
authorities, or qualifies their consensus of opinion, by his
own apparently rich experience as a practicing or experimental
astrologer. Indeed, for him the theory and practice
of the art, the paths of reason and experience, are so united
that he not merely speaks of “this reasoning” or view as
being “tested by experience,”<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> but seems to employ the
words <i>ratio</i> and <i>experimentum</i> somewhat indiscriminately
for astrological tenet or technique.<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Gundissalinus
<i>De
divisione
philosophiae</i>.</div>

<p>The chief known work of Gundissalinus, the archdeacon
who was for a time perhaps associated with John of Spain
in the labor of translation, is his <i>De divisione philosophiae</i>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span><a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>
a treatise which owes much to the Turkoman Al-Farabi
(Muh. b. Muh. b. Tarchân b. Uzlag, Abû Nasr, el-Fârâbî).
If Baur is right in thinking that Gundissalinus made use of
translations by Gerard of Cremona, 1114-1187, in the <i>De
divisione philosophiae</i>,<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> it would appear to be a later work
than his translating for Archbishop Raymond, 1130-1150,
which perhaps began as early as 1133.<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Place of
magic in
the classification
of the
sciences.</div>

<p>In the classification and description of the sciences which
make up the bulk of the <i>De divisione philosophiae</i> Gundissalinus
gives a certain place to the occult arts. At the beginning
of the book, it is true, the magic arts are not classed
among useful things of the spirit like the virtues and true
sciences (<i>honestae scientiae</i>). Neither, however, are they
grouped with pride, avarice, and vain glory as harmful vices,
but are merely classed along with worldly honors as vanities.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span><a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>
“Nigromancy according to physics,” however, is later
listed as one of eight sub-divisions of natural science together
with alchemy, medicine, agriculture, navigation, the
science of mirrors, and the sciences of images and of judgments.<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a>
Gundissalinus was innocent, however, of any detailed
knowledge of necromancy or indeed of any of the
other sub-divisions except medicine. He explains that he
has not yet advanced as far as these subjects in his studies.<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>
He is manifestly simply copying an Arabic classification,
probably from Al-Farabi’s <i>De ortu scientiarum</i>, and one of
which we find similar traces in other medieval Christian
authors.<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Al-Farabi
<i>De ortu
scientiarum</i>.</div>

<p>This little treatise on <i>The Rise of the Sciences</i> by Al-Farabi,
although it occupies only a leaf or two in the manuscripts
and has only recently been printed,<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> is a rather important
one to note, as other of its statements than its eight
sub-divisions of natural science seem to be paralleled in
medieval Latin writers. There seems, for instance, a resemblance
between its attitude towards the sciences and
classification of them and that of Roger Bacon in the <i>Opus
Maius</i>.<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> Al-Farabi believes in God the Creator, as his opening
words show, and he regards “divine science” as the end
and perfection of the other sciences; “and beyond it investigation
does not go, for it is itself the goal to which all
inquiry tends.”<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> At the same time Al-Farabi emphasizes
the importance of natural science, adding its eight parts to
the four divisions of the <i>quadrivium</i>&mdash;arithmetic, geometry,
astrology, and music, and saying, “Moreover, this last (i. e.
natural) science is greater and broader than any of those
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
sciences and disciplines (or, than any of those disciplinary
sciences).” We need a science, he says in effect, which
deals inclusively with changes in nature, showing how they
are brought about and their causes and enabling us to repel
their harmful action when we wish or to augment them,&mdash;a
science of action and passion.<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> This suggestion of applied
science and of a connection between it and magic also
reminds one of Roger Bacon, as does Al-Farabi’s statement
later that the beginning of all sciences is the science of
language.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gundissalinus
on
astrology.</div>

<p>Both for Al-Farabi and Gundissalinus the sciences of
images and judgments were undoubtedly astrological. Gundissalinus
himself believes that the spiritual virtue of the
celestial bodies is the efficient cause, ordained by the Creator,
of generation, corruption, and other natural operations
in this corporeal world. He defines <i>astrologia</i> as we would
astronomy, while he explains that <i>astronomia</i> is the science
of answering questions from the position of the planets and
signs. There are many such sciences,&mdash;geomancy, hydromancy,
aeromancy, pyromancy, chiromancy, and augury;
but astronomy is superior to the rest because it predicts what
will befall upon earth from the dispositions of the heavenly
bodies. Gundissalinus also repeats Isidore’s distinction between
<i>astronomia</i> and <i>astrologia</i>, and between the natural
and superstitious varieties of “astronomy.”<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Robert

<p>At this point it may be well to note briefly a later work
with a very similar title to that of Gundissalinus, namely,
the <i>De ortu sive divisione scientiarum</i> of Robert Kilwardby,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span><a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>
archbishop of Canterbury from 1272 to 1279. The work
borrows a great deal from Isidore, Hugh of St. Victor, and
Gundissalinus. One of its more original passages is that in
which Kilwardby suggests an alteration in Hugh’s division
of the mechanical arts, omitting theatrical performances as
more suited to Gentiles than Catholics, and arranging the
mechanical arts in a <i>trivium</i> consisting of earth-culture,
food-science, and medicine, and a <i>quadrivium</i> made up of
costuming, armor-making, architecture, and business-courses
(<i>mercatura</i>), after the analogy of the seven liberal
arts.<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> Kilwardby, as has been already noted elsewhere, repeats
Hugh’s classification of the magic arts.<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Plato of
Tivoli.</div>

<p>Next in importance to John of Spain as a translator of
Arabic astrology in the first half of the twelfth century
should probably be ranked Plato of Tivoli. They seem to
have worked independently and sometimes to have made
distinct translations of the same work, as in the case of the
<i>Nativities</i> of Albohali and the <i>Epistle</i> of Messahala. On
the whole, Plato’s translations<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> would appear slightly to
antedate John’s. Haskins has shown, however, that the date
1116, hitherto assigned for Plato’s translation of the <i>Liber
embadorum</i> of Savasorda, should be 1145.<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> But Plato’s
translation of Albohali is dated 1136, while John’s was not
made until 1153.<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> In 1136 is also dated Plato’s translation
of the astrological work of Almansor in the form of one
hundred and fifty or so brief aphorisms, judgments, propositions,
or <i>capitula</i>, which later appeared repeatedly in print.
Two years later he turned the famous <i>Quadripartitum</i> of
Ptolemy into Latin. His other translations include Albucasis
(Abû’l-Qâsim Chalaf b. ʿAbbâs el-Zahrâwî) on the
astrolabe, Haly (ʿAlî b. Ridwân b. ʿAlî b. Ğaʿfar, Abû’l-Hasan)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
on nativities, and a geomancy. Most of Plato’s
translations were produced at Barcelona.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Robert of

<p>In a manuscript at the British Museum<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> one of Plato of
Tivoli’s translations is immediately preceded in the same
large clear hand, different from the smaller and later writing
employed in the remainder of the manuscript, by a translation
of the <i>Judgments</i> of the astrologer Alkindi by Robert
of Chester,<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> with an introduction to “my Hermann,” whom
Robert commends highly as an astronomer. A letter written
in 1143 by Peter the Venerable to St. Bernard tells how in
1141 he had induced two “acute and well trained scholars,”
who were then residing in Spain near the river Ebro, to
turn for a time from the arts of astrology which they had
been studying there, and to translate the Koran. These
two translators were the friends whom we have just mentioned,
Hermann of Dalmatia and Robert of Chester. Robert,
too, tells us in the prefatory letter to the translation of
the Koran, completed in 1143, that this piece of work was
“a digression from his principal studies of astronomy and
geometry.” Besides such mathematical treatises as his
translations of the <i>Judicia</i> of Alkindi, the Algebra of Al-Khowarizmi,
a treatise on the astrolabe ascribed to Ptolemy,
and several sets of astronomical tables, including a revision
or rearrangement of Adelard of Bath’s translation of the
Tables of Al-Khowarizmi, Robert on February 11, 1144,
translated a treatise on alchemy which Morienus Romanus,
a monk of Jerusalem, was supposed to have written for
“Calid, king of Egypt,” or Prince Khalid ibn Jazid, a
Mohammedan pretender and patron of learning at Alexandria.
Of it we shall treat more fully in another chapter.
About 1150 we seem to find Robert returned to his native
England and writing at London.<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Hugh of
Santalla.</div>

<p>Hugo Sanctelliensis or Hugh of Santalla<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> is another
translator of the first half of the twelfth century in the
Spanish peninsula who appears to have worked independently
of the foregoing men, since he to some extent translated
the same works, for instance, the <i>Centiloquium</i> ascribed to
Ptolemy, Latin versions of which have also been credited to
Plato of Tivoli and John of Seville. Hugh’s translations
are undated but at least some of them may have antedated
those of the men already mentioned,<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> since Haskins has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
identified Hugh’s patron, “my lord, Bishop Michael,” with
the holder of the see of Tarazona from 1119 to 1151.
Hugh’s nine known translations are concerned with works
of astronomy, astrology, and divination. Those on astrology
include, besides the <i>Centiloquium</i> already mentioned,
Albumasar’s <i>Book of Rains</i>, Messahala on nativities, and a
<i>Book of Aristotle from 255 volumes of the Indians</i>, of
which we shall have more to say in the chapter on the
Pseudo-Aristotle. The works on other forms of divination
are a geomancy<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> and <i>De spatula</i>, a treatise on divination
from the shoulder-blades of animals. In the preface to the
geomancy he promises to treat next of hydromancy but says
that he has failed to find books of aeromancy or pyromancy.<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a>
Although, as has been said, Hugh seems to have labored independently
of the other translators and in a somewhat out-of-the-way
town, he nevertheless seems to have felt himself
in touch with the learning of his time. In his various prefaces,
like William of Conches, he speaks of “moderns” as
well as the arcana of the ancients,<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> and his patron is continually
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
urging him to write not only what he has gathered
from the books of the ancients but what he has learned by
experiment.<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> In the preface to his translation of Albumasar’s
<i>Book of Rains</i> he tells Bishop Michael that “what the
modern astrologers of the Gauls most bemoan their lack of,
your benignity may bestow upon posterity,”<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> and the distribution
of manuscripts of his translations in European
libraries indicates that they were widely influential.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A contemporary
memorial
of
Gerard of
Cremona.</div>

<p>The best source for the life and works of Gerard of
Cremona<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> (1114-1187) is a memorandum attached by his
friends to what was presumably his last work, a translation
of the <i>Tegni</i> of Galen with the commentary of Haly, in imitation
of Galen who in old age was induced to draw up a
list of his own works. Gerard, however, is already dead
when his associates write, having worked right up to life’s
close and passed away in 1187 at the age of seventy-three.
They state that from the very cradle he was educated in the
lap of philosophy, and that he learned all he could in every
department of it studied among the Latins. Then, moved
by his passion for the Almagest, which he found nowhere
among the Latins, he came to Toledo. There, beholding the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
abundance of books in every field in Arabic and the poverty
of the Latins in this respect, he devoted his life to the labor
of translation, scorning the desires of the flesh, although he
was rich in worldly goods, and adhering to things of the
spirit alone. He toiled for the advantage of all both present
and future, not unmindful of the injunction of Ptolemy
to work good increasingly as you near your end. Now,
that his name may not be hidden in silence and darkness,
and that no alien name may be inscribed by presumptuous
thievery in his translations, the more so since he (like Galen)
never signed his own name to any of them, they have drawn
up a list of all the works translated by him whether in dialectic
or geometry, in “astrology” or philosophy, in medicine or
in the other sciences.<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Account
by a pupil
of his astrological
teaching.</div>

<p>Another contemporary picture of Gerard’s activity at
Toledo is provided us by the Englishman, Daniel of Morley,
or <i>de Merlai</i>, who went to Spain to study the sciences of
the <i>quadrivium</i>. He tells how Gerard of Toledo (<i>Gerardus
tholetanus</i>), interpreting the Almagest in Latin with the aid
of Galippus, the Mozarab,<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> asserted that various future
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
events followed necessarily from the movements and
influences of the stars. Daniel was at first astounded by
this utterance and brought forward the arguments against
the <i>mathematici</i> or astrologers in the homily of St. Gregory.
But Gerard answered them all glibly. It should perhaps
be added that in another passage Daniel without mentioning
Gerard speaks of setting down in Latin what he learned
concerning the universe in the speech of Toledo from Galippus,
the Mozarab.<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> Gerard’s translation of the Almagest
seems to have been completed in 1175,<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> but meanwhile in
Sicily an anonymous translation from the Greek had appeared,
probably soon after 1160. Of it we shall presently
have something to say. Gerard’s version was, however, the
generally accepted one, as the number of manuscripts and
citations of it show.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Character
of
Gerard’s
translations.</div>

<p>But to return to the list of Gerard’s translations. Only
three of the long list are strictly dialectical, Aristotle’s <i>Posterior
Analytics</i>, the commentary of Themistius upon them,
and Alfarabi on the syllogism. And only one or two of the
translations listed under the heading <i>De phylosophya</i> are
pure philosophy.<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> Most of Gerard’s work is mathematical
and medical, natural and occult science. He translates Ptolemy
and Euclid; Archimedes, Galen and Aristotle; Autolycus
and Theodosius; and such writers in Arabic as Alkindi,
Alfarabi, Albucasis, Alfraganus, Messahala, Thebit, Geber,
Alhazen, Isaac, Rasis, and Avicenna. His mathematical
translations include the fields of algebra and perspective
as well as geometry and astronomy. Of Aristotle’s natural
philosophy the list includes the <i>Physics</i>, <i>De coelo et mundo</i>,
<i>De generatione et corruptione</i>, <i>De meteoris</i> except the fourth
and last book which he could not find,<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> and the first part of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
the astrological <i>De causis proprietatum et elementorum</i> ascribed
to Aristotle. Among his translations of Galen was
the apocryphal <i>De secretis</i>, of which we shall have more to
say in a later chapter on books of experiments. Three
treatises of alchemy are included in the list of his translations
and also a geomancy, although Boncompagni tries
to saddle the latter upon Gerardus de Sabloneto. Gerard
is also supposed to have translated some works not mentioned
in this list but ascribed to him in the manuscripts.
One of interest to us is a work on stones of the Pseudo-Aristotle.<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Science
and
religion in
the preface
to a
translation
of the
<i>Almagest</i>
from the
Greek.</div>

<p>We must say a word of the anonymous Sicilian translation
of the <i>Almagest</i> which preceded that of Gerard of
Cremona, because of a defense in its preface<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> of natural
science against a theological opposition of which the anonymous
translator appears to be painfully conscious. After
darkly hinting that he was prevented from speedily completing
the translation by “other secret” obstacles<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> as well
as by the manifest fact that he did not understand “the
science of the stars” well,<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> and remarking that the artisan
can hope for nothing where the art is in disrepute, the translator
inveighs against those who rashly judge things about
which they know nothing, and who, lest they seem ignorant
themselves, call what they do not know useless and profane.
Hence the Arabs say that there is no greater enemy of an
art than one who is unacquainted with it. So far the tone
of the preface reminds one strongly of those of William of
Conches. The writer proceeds to complain that the opposition
to mathematical studies has gone so far that “the science
of numbers and mensuration is thought entirely superfluous
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
and useless, while the study of astronomy (i. e. astrology)
is esteemed idolatry.”<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> Yet Remigius tells us that
Abraham taught the Egyptians “astrology” (i. e. astronomy),
and the translator ironically adds that he supposes it
can be shown from Moses and Daniel that God condemned
the science of the stars. He then dilates on how essential it
is to study and understand the created world before rising
to study of the Creator, and waxes sarcastic at the expense
of those who study theology before they know anything
else and think themselves able like eagles to soar aloft
at once above the clouds, disdaining earth and earthly things,
and to gaze unblinded upon the full sun:<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a>&mdash;a passage somewhat
similar to Roger Bacon’s diatribe against the “boy-theologians”
in the following century.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Arabs and
moderns.</div>

<p>The translator, although his own rendition is from a
Greek manuscript, shows some familiarity with Arabic
learning. Besides the Arabic saying already quoted, in
giving the Greek title of Ptolemy’s thirteen books on astronomy
he adds that the Saracens call it by the corrupt
name, <i>elmeguisti</i> (i. e. <i>Almagest</i>).<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> He also acknowledges
the aid he has received from Eugene, the admiral or emir,
whose translation of Ptolemy’s <i>Optics</i> from the Arabic we
have mentioned elsewhere, and whom he describes as equally
skilled in Greek and Arabic, and “also not ignorant of
Latin.” It may also be noted that as Adelard of Bath contrasted
“the writings of men of old” with “the science of
moderns,”<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> so this translator characterizes Ptolemy as
<i>veterum lima, specculum modernorum</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Astronomy
at
Marseilles.</div>

<p>This seems the best place to call attention to some evidence
for the existence of astronomical, and apparently
also astrological, activity at Marseilles in the twelfth century,
seemingly under the influence of the Arabic astronomy
and astrology. In a manuscript at Paris which
the catalogue dates of the twelfth century<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> is a treatise formerly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
said to have been composed at Marseilles in the year
1111 A. D. But Duhem has suggested that the XI should
be XL, since the author tells of a dispute at Marseilles in
1139.<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> The text tells how to find the location of the
planets for the city of Marseilles and is accompanied by
astronomical tables imitating Azarchel. The same treatise
appears in a manuscript at Cambridge,<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> written before the
year 1175, where it is entitled “The Book of the Courses
of the Seven Planets for Marseilles” and seems to be attributed
to a Raymond of that city. Duhem notes that
our author often cites an earlier treatise of his, <i>De compositione
astrolabii</i>. The treatise opens with allusion to
“many of the Indians and Chaldeans and Arabs”; the author
also says, “And since we were the first of the Latins to whom
this science came after the translation of the Arabs,” and
avers that he employs the Christian calendar and chronology
in order to avoid all appearance of heresy or infidelity. So
we would seem to be justified in connecting it with the diffusion
of Arabic astronomy and astrology. Our author
believes that God endowed the sky with the virtue of presaging
the future, cites various authorities sacred and profane
in favor of astrology, and emphasizes especially the
importance of astrological medicine.<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> It was also at Marseilles
that William of England early in the next century in
the year 1219 wrote his brief but very popular treatise,
found in many manuscripts, entitled “Of Urine Unseen”
(<i>De urina non visa</i>), that is, how by astrology to diagnose
a case and tell the color and substance of the urine without
seeing it. Of it we shall treat again later in connection with
thirteenth century medicine. But we may note here that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
William, although of English nationality, was a citizen of
Marseilles, and that the person to whom his work <i>Of Urine
Unseen</i> was addressed had formerly studied with him at
Marseilles. William is also spoken of as a professor of
medicine. Furthermore in at least one manuscript William
of England is called a translator from the Arabic, since he
is said to have translated from that tongue into Latin “The
very great Secret of Catenus, king of the Persians, concerning
the virtue of the eagle.”<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> We may also note that it was
in reply to inquiries which he had received from Jews of
Marseilles that Moses Maimonides in 1194 addressed to
them his letter on astrology.<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> Interest in astronomy and
astrology thus appears to have prevailed at Marseilles from
the first half to the close of the twelfth century.</p>

190, 13-14th century, fol. 87, gives
the Arabic year as 529, while its
1173 should obviously not be A. D.
but of the Spanish era. Corpus
Christi 224 gives the Arabic year
as 528, and the era date has been
altered to clxx. m. (1170), probably
from mclxxiii (1173), the
initial ‘m’ dropping out, and the
final ‘iii’ in consequence being misread
by a copyist as ‘m.’ The
same careless copyist has perhaps
dropped an ‘i’ from the arabic
year. In BN 6506 and 7377B,
according to Jourdain (1819) pp.
115-6, the Arabic year is 529, but
the other 1070, a further error.

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_188" href="#FNanchor_188" class="label">[188]</a> Steinschneider ascribes the
translation of Albohali to John
of Spain; the Catalogue of the
Royal Manuscripts says that
Johannes Toletanus is possibly the
same as John of Spain. Sudhoff
(1917), p. 17, identifies “Johann
von Toledo (Hispanus, Avendehut).”</p>

<p>Perhaps, however, the John of
Toledo to whom a treatise entitled,
<i>De conservanda sanitate</i>, is
ascribed in two 14th century MSS
at Paris, BN 6978, #1 and 16222,
fol. 76-; also Berlin 905, 15th century,
fol. 74-; CU Gonville and
Caius 95, 15th century, fol. 283-;
was not the same person.</p>

<p>Rose, in the Berlin MSS catalogue,
identifies this last John of
Toledo with a John David of
Toledo who in 1322 joined with
other astrologers in issuing a
threatening circular letter predicting
terrible events for the year
1329. See Amplon. Quarto 371 for
another such letter for the year
1371, and Amplon. Octavo 79 for

<p>Steinschneider fails, I think, to

an “introductio de cursu

<p><a id="Footnote_203" href="#FNanchor_203" class="label">[203]</a> Ed. Ludwig Baur, in <i>Beiträge</i>,
IV, 2-3, Münster, 1903, pp. 1-144
text; pp. 145-408 “Untersuchung.”
Another work by Gundissalinus
on the immortality of the soul
was published in the same series
by G. F. von Hertling, 1897.</p>

<p>Baur unfortunately failed to
note the existence of the <i>De
divisione philosophiae</i> in two
13th century MSS at the British
Museum in the Sloane collection,
nor does Scott’s Index catalogue
of the Sloane MSS mention Gundissalinus
as their author.</p>

<p>Sloane 2946, 13th century, fols.
209-16, “de philosophia ... auctore
Isaaco philosopho.” But the
Incipit, “Felix prior aetas qui
(quae) tot sapientes ...” is that
of Gundissalinus’ treatise. The
erroneous ascription to Isaac is
probably owing to the fact that
the treatise just preceding, at fols.
205-208v, is a translation of a
medical work by Isaac. This MS
is mutilated towards the close so
that the leaves containing our
text have the upper right hand
corner torn off, thus removing
nearly one-sixth of the text. The
colophon reads, “Explicit hoc
opus a domino Gundissalini apud
Tholetum editum, sdens (succedens?)
de assignanda causa ex
qua orte sunt scientie philosophie
et ordo eorum et disciplina.”
Similarly in Baur’s text the <i>De
divisione philosophiae</i> at pp. 1-142
is followed at pp. 142-44 by
Alfarabi’s “Epistola de assignanda
causa ex qua orte sunt
scientie philosophie et ordo earum
in disciplina.”</p>

<p>Sloane 2461, late 13th century,
fols. 1-38r, contains the <i>De
divisione philosophiae</i> under the
caption, <i>Compendium scientiarum</i>,
without indication of the author.
It also is immediately followed
at fols. 38v-40r by <i>De unitate</i>,
which Baur found in another MS
at the close of Gundissalinus’ <i>De
divisione philosophiae</i>, and in a
third MS before the above mentioned
letter of Alfarabi.</p>

<p>A MS now lost is, Library of
St. Augustine’s Abbey, Canterbury,
1175, Gundisalvus de ortu et
divisione scientiarum.</p>

<p>Cotton Vespasian B-X, fols. 24-27,
Alpharabius de divisione omnium
scientiarum, is not the treatise
of Gundissalinus, as I was at
first inclined to suspect that it
might turn out to be upon examination.</p>

<p>Alfarabi’s <i>De scientiis</i> was published
in his <i>Opera omnia</i> by
Camerarius at Paris in 1638 from
a MS which the preface represented
as a recent discovery.
Baur, p. viii, states that this text
differs considerably from the
Latin version by Gerard of Cremona,
but that the borrowings of
Gundissalinus from Alfarabi and
the citations in Vincent of Beauvais’
<i>Speculum doctrinale</i> agree
with this 1638 text rather than
with Gerard’s.</p>

do not know where he gets the

ascribed to Hermannus Theutonicus
by Denifle (1886), p. 231,&mdash;and
not mentioned by Steinschneider&mdash;seem
to indicate another
person of that name: “(41) fr.

<p><a id="Footnote_234" href="#FNanchor_234" class="label">[234]</a> I cannot, however, agree with
Professor Haskins (p. 10), that
“From certain phrases in the
preface” (of Hugh’s translation
of the <i>Liber Aristotilis de 255 indorum
voluminibus</i>) “it would
seem that, while Hugo has been
for some time a devotee of
Arabian science, he has only recently
(<i>nunc</i>) and comparatively
late in the day (<i>serus ac indignus
minister</i>) entered the bishop’s
service.” It seems to me that the
last phrase should read <i>servus ac
indignus minister</i>, for Hugh had
already translated at least one
other work for the bishop before
this one on the 255 books of the
Indians, and in the present preface
he alludes to many previous
discussions between them and to
the bishop’s continually exhorting
him to publish, so that one would
infer that they had been associated
for some time past. Since
writing this I have learned both
from Mr. H. H. E. Craster of the
Bodleian and from Professor
Haskins himself that the reading
in the MS (Digby 159, fol. 1v) is
“seruus” or <i>servus</i>, as I have it
in the rough notes I took on the
treatise in August, 1919.</p>

<p>Johannes Campanus (of Novara) is of course well known for his
<i>Theory of the Planets</i> and translation of and commentary on
Euclid. Perhaps less familiar works are: Additional 22772,
15th century, Johannis Campani Novarensis liber astronomicus
de erroribus Ptolemaei, dedicated to Pope Urban IV; Amplon.
Quarto 349, late 14th century, fols. 57-65, de figura sectorum;
indeed, the collection of Amplonius at Erfurt is rich in works
by Campanus. Concerning him see further HL XXI (1847)
248-54 and Duhem III (1915) 317-21. They hold that Campanus
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
is not called John in the MSS. His letter to Urban IV
(1261-1265) and Simon of Genoa’s dedication of this <i>Clavis
sanationis</i> in 1292 to “master Campanus, chaplain of the pope
and canon at Paris,” serve to date him in the later 13th century.</p>

<p>John of London, BN 7413, 14th century, fols. 19v-21r, de astrologia
judicaria ad R. de Guedingue, or it may be better described as a
letter, written in 1246 or shortly thereafter (“usque ad consideracionem
meam que fuit anno Christi 1246”), in which John
discusses various matters, including the motion of the eighth
sphere and dog days, and states that he is sending a transcript
of tables of the fixed stars which he verified at Paris.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span></p>

<p>The John of London who gave so many MSS to the library of St.
Augustine’s, Canterbury&mdash;see James (1903)&mdash;would seem to
have been of later date, since his books included works of
Aquinas, Roger Bacon, and John Peckham, the chronicle of
Martin which extends to 1277, translations of the astrological
treatises of Abraham aben Ezra which were not made until
toward the close of the 13th century, and even treatises by
Joannes de Lineriis who wrote in the early 14th century and
William of St. Cloud who made his astronomical observations
between 1285 and 1321. It therefore seems unlikely that the
donor, John of London, could be even the young lad who was
spoken of in such high terms by Roger Bacon, as is suggested
by James (1903) pp. lxxiv-vii. Possibly the Friar John mentioned
below is Bacon’s protégé.</p>

<p>John Manduith, CUL 1572 (Gg. VI. 3), 14th century, astronomical

identical with John of Sicily, see Steinschneider (1905) p. 51.</p>

<p>Johannes Parisiensis, master in theology, besides several theological
treatises wrote <i>de yride</i> and <i>super librum metheorum</i>. His
<i>Contra corruptum Thome</i> shows that he wrote after Aquinas.
See Denifle (1886) p. 226.</p>

<p>There was also a medical writer named John of Paris who perhaps,
rather than Thaddeus of Florence, wrote the treatise, De
complexionibus corporis humani, Amplon. Quarto 35, 1421
A. D., fols. 142-58. The remark of V. Rose may also be recalled,

<p>Ioannes de Rupecissa, a Franciscan who wrote various works on
alchemy and who was imprisoned by the pope in 1345 for his
prophecies concerning the church and antichrist; it would take
too long to list the MSS here.</p>

<p>Johannes de Sacrobosco (John Holywood), well known for his
<i>Sphere</i>, which has been repeatedly printed and was the subject
of commentaries by many medieval authors.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Problem
of his
identity.</div>

<p>Bernard Silvester, of whom this chapter will treat, is
now generally recognized as a different person from
the Bernard of Chartres whom William of Conches followed
and on whose teaching John of Salisbury looked
back.<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> From John’s account it is plain that Bernard of
Chartres belonged to the generation before William of Conches,
and Clerval has shown reason to believe that he was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
dead by 1130.<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> Bernard Silvester, on the other hand, wrote
his <i>De mundi universitate</i> during the pontificate of Eugenius
III, 1145-1153. Moreover, one of his pupils informs us
that he taught at Tours.<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> This last fact also makes it difficult,
although not impossible, to identify him with a Breton,
named Bernard de Moelan, who, after serving as canon and
chancellor at Chartres, became bishop of Quimper from
1159 to 1167.<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> At least they appear to have had somewhat
similar interests, and Silvester seems to have had some connection
with the school of Chartres, since he dedicated the
<i>De mundi universitate</i> to Theodoric of Chartres.<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">His works.</div>

<p>A number of works are extant under the name of Bernard
Silvester. His interest in rhetoric and poetry is shown
by a long <i>Summa dictaminis</i> (or, <i>dictaminum</i>) and by a
<i>Liber de metrificatura</i>, in the <i>Titulus</i> of which he is called
“a poet of the first rank” (<i>optimi poetae</i>).<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> He also wrote
a commentary on the first books of the <i>Aeneid</i>.<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> Two other
treatises are ascribed to him in which we are not here further
interested, namely: <i>De forma vitae honestae</i> and <i>De
cura rei familiaris</i> or <i>Epistola ad Raimundum de modo rei
familiaris gubernandae</i>.<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> The three works of especial interest
to us, while no one of them is exactly a treatise on
astrology, all illustrate, albeit each in a different way, the
dominance of astrological doctrine in the thought of the
time. One is <i>Experimentarius</i>, an astrological geomancy
translated into verse from the Arabic.<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> Another is a narrative
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
poem whose plot hinges upon an astrologer’s prediction
and whose very title is <i>Mathematicus</i>.<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> The third
work, variously entitled <i>De mundi universitate</i>, <i>Megacosmus
et Microcosmus</i>, and <i>Cosmographia</i><a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> has much to say of the
stars and their rule over inferior creation.<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> It is written
partly in prose and partly in verse,<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> and shows that Bernard
laid as much stress on literary form in his scientific or
pseudo-scientific works as in those on rhetoric and meter.
Sandys says of it, “The rhythm of the hexameters is clearly
that of Lucan, while the vocabulary is mainly that of Ovid”;
but Dr. Poole believes that the hexameters are modelled upon
Lucretius.<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> He would date it either in 1145 or about 1147-1148.<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Their
influence.</div>

<p>The manuscripts of these three works are fairly numerous,
indicating that they were widely read, and no contemporary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
objection appears to have been raised against
their rather extreme astrological doctrines. As was well
observed concerning the <i>De mundi universitate</i> over one
hundred and fifty years ago, “These extravagances and some
other similar ones did not prevent the book from achieving
a very brilliant success from the moment of its first appearance,”
as is shown by the contemporary testimony of
Peter Cantor in the closing twelfth century and Eberhart
de Bethune in the early thirteenth century, who says that the
<i>De mundi universitate</i> was read in the schools. Gervaise of
Tilbury and Vincent of Beauvais also cited it.<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> Indeed in
our next chapter we shall find a Christian abbess, saint, and
prophetess of Bernard’s own time charged&mdash;by a modern
writer, it is true&mdash;with making use of it in her visions.
Passages from Silvester are included in a thirteenth century
collection of “Proverbs” from ancient and recent
writers,<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> and more than one copy of the <i>De mundi universitate</i>
is listed in such a medieval monastic library as St. Augustine’s,
Canterbury.<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Disregard
of Christian
theology.</div>

<p>In the <i>De mundi universitate</i> we see the same influence
of Platonism and astronomy, and of the Latin translation
of the <i>Timaeus</i> in especial, as in the <i>Philosophia</i> of William
of Conches. At the same time, its abstract personages and
personified sciences, its <i>Nous</i> and <i>Natura</i>, its <i>Urania</i> and
<i>Physis</i> with her two daughters, <i>Theoretical and Practical</i>,
remind us of the pages of Martianus Capella and of Adelard
of Bath’s <i>De eodem et diverso</i>. The characterization by
Dr. Poole that the work “has an entirely pagan complexion,”
and that Bernard’s scheme of cosmology is pantheistic and
takes no account of Christian theology,<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> is essentially true,
although occasionally some utterance indicates that the writer
is acquainted with Christianity and no true pagan. Perhaps
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
it is just because Bernard makes no pretense of being
a theologian, that at a time when William of Conches was
retracting in his <i>Dragmaticon</i> some of the views expressed in
his <i>Philosophia</i> and the Sicilian translator was conscious of
a bigoted theological opposition, Bernard should display neither
fear nor consciousness of the existence of any such opposition.
And yet it does not appear that the Sicilian translator
engaged in theological discussion. Yet he complains
of those who call astronomy idolatry; Bernard calmly calls
the stars gods, and no one seems to have raised the least objection.
At least Bernard’s fearless outspokenness and its
subsequent popularity should prevent our laying too much
stress upon the timidity of other writers in expressing new
views, and should make us hesitate before interpreting their
attitude as a sure sign of real danger to freedom of thought
and speech, and to scientific investigation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The divine
stars.</div>

<p>What especially concerns our investigation are the views
concerning stars and spirits expressed by Silvester. Like
William of Conches, he describes the world of spirits in a
Platonic or Neo-Platonic, rather than patristic, style. He
differs from William in hardly using the word “demon” at
all and in according the stars, like Adelard of Bath, a much
higher place in his hierarchy. “The heaven itself is full of
God,” says Bernard, “and the sky has its own animals, sidereal
fires,”<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> just as man, who is in part a spiritual being,
inhabits the earth. Bernard does not hesitate to call the
stars “gods who serve God in person,” or “who serve in
God’s very presence.”<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> There in the region of purer ether
which extends as far as the sun they enjoy the vision of bliss
eternal, free from all care and distraction, and resting in the
peace of God which passeth all understanding.<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> He also
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
repeats the Platonic doctrine that the mind is from the sky
and that the human soul, when at last it lays aside the body,
“will return to its kindred stars, added as a god to the number
of superior beings.”<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Orders of
spirits.</div>

<p>Between heaven and earth, between God and man, comes
the mediate and composite order of “angelic creation.”
“With the divinity of the stars” the members of this order
share the attribute of deathlessness; with man they have
this in common, to be stirred by passion and impulse.<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> Between
sun and moon are benevolent angels who act as mediums
between God and man. Other spirits inhabit the air
beneath the moon. Some of them display an affinity to the
near-by ether and fire, and live in tranquillity and mental
serenity, although dwelling in the air. A second variety are
the <i>genii</i> who are associated each with some man from birth
to warn and guide him. But in the lower atmosphere are
disorderly and malignant spirits who often are divinely
commissioned to torment evil-doers, or sometimes torment
men of their own volition. Often they invisibly invade
human minds and thoughts by silent suggestion; again they
assume bodies and take on ghostly forms. These Bernard
calls <i>angelos desertores</i>, or fallen angels. But there are still

or in forests and by streams: <i>Silvani</i>, Pans, and <i>Nerei</i>.
They are of harmless character (<i>innocua conversatione</i>)
and, being composed of the elements in a pure state, are long-lived

<p>Bernard’s assertion that the stars are gods is accompanied,
as one would naturally expect, by a belief in their
control of nature and revelation of the future. From their
proximity to God they receive from His mind the secrets
of the future, which they “establish through the lower species

the future in cryptic letters, I have revealed to the eyes of
the more learned.”<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> In another passage Bernard affirms
that God writes in the stars of the sky what can come “from
fatal law,” that the movements of the stars control all ages,
that there already is latent in the stars a series of events
which long time will unfold, and that all the events of history,
even the birth of Christ, have been foreshadowed by
the stars.</p>

<p>Yet Bernard urges man to model his life after the stars,<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a>
and once speaks of “what is free in the will and what is of
necessity.” He thus appears, like the author of the treatise
on fate ascribed to Plutarch, like Boethius, and like a host
of other theologians, philosophers, and astrologers, to believe
in the co-existence of free will, inevitable fate, and
“variable fortune.”<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Plot of the
<i>Mathematicus</i>.</div>

<p>Bernard Silvester’s interest and faith in the art of astrology
is further exemplified by his poem <i>Mathematicus</i>,
a narrative which throughout assumes the truth of astrological
prediction concerning human fortune. Hauréau showed
that it had been incorrectly included among the works of
Hildebert of Tours and Le Mans, and that the theme is
suggested in the fourth Pseudo-Quintillian declamation, but
that Bernard has added largely to the plot there briefly outlined.
A Roman knight and lady were in every respect well
endowed both by nature and fortune except that their marriage
had up to the moment when the story opens been a
childless one. At last the wife consulted an astrologer or
<i>mathematicus</i>, “who could learn from the stars,” we are told,
“the intentions of the gods, the mind of the fates, and the
plan of Jove, and discover the hidden causes and secrets of
nature.” He informed her that she would bear a son who
would become a great genius and the ruler of Rome, but
who would one day kill his father. When the wife told her
husband of this prediction, he made her promise to kill the
child in infancy. But when the time came, her mother love
prevailed and she secretly sent the boy away to be reared,
while she assured her husband that he was dead. She named
her son <i>Patricida</i> in order that he might abhor the crime
of patricide the more. The boy early gave signs of great
intellectual capacity. Among other studies he learned “the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
orbits of the stars and how human fate is under the stars,”
and he “clasped divine Aristotle to his breast.” Later on,
when Rome was hard pressed by the Carthaginians and her
king was in captivity, he rallied her defeated forces and
ended the war in triumph.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“And because the fatal order demands it so shall be,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The fates gave him this path to dominion....</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Blind chance sways the silly toiling of men;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Our world is the plaything and sport of the gods.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The king thereupon abdicated in favor of <i>Patricida</i>, whom
he addressed in these words, “O youth, on whose birth, if
there is any power in the stars, a favorable horoscope looked
down.”</p>

<p>The mother rejoiced to hear of her son’s success, and
marveled at the correctness of the astrologer’s prediction,
but was now the more troubled as to her husband’s fate. He
noticed her distraction and at last induced her to tell him
its cause. But then, instead of being angry at the deception
which she had practiced upon him, and instead of being
alarmed at the prospect of his own death, he, too, rejoiced
in his son’s success, and said that he would die happy, if he
could but see and embrace him. He accordingly made himself
known to his son and told him how he had once ordered
his death but had been thwarted by the eternal predestined
order of events, and how some day his son would slay him,
not of evil intent but compelled by the courses of the stars.
“And manifest is the fault of the gods in that you cannot
be kinder to your father.”</p>

<p>The son thereupon determines that he will evade the
decree of the stars by committing suicide. He is represented
as soliloquizing as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“How is our mind akin to the ethereal stars,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If it suffers the sad necessity of harsh Lachesis?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In vain we possess a particle of the divine mind,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If our reason cannot make provision for itself.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">God so made the elements, so made the fiery stars,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That man is not subject to the stars.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Patricida accordingly summons all the Romans together,
and, after inducing them by an eloquent rehearsal of his
great services in their behalf to grant him any boon that he
may ask, says that his wish is to die; and at this point the
poem ends, leaving us uninformed whether the last part of
the astrologer’s prediction remained unfulfilled, or whether
Patricida’s suicide caused his father’s death, or whether possibly
some solution was found in a play upon the word
<i>Patricida</i>. Hauréau, however, believed that the poem is
complete as it stands.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Different
interpretations
put
upon the
<i>Mathematicus</i>.</div>

<p>The purpose of the poet and his attitude towards astrology
have been interpreted in diametrically opposite ways by
different scholars. Before Hauréau it was customary to attribute
the poem to Hildebert, archbishop of Tours, and to
regard it as an attack upon astrology. The early editors of
the <i>Histoire Littéraire de la France</i> supported their assertion
that the most judicious men of letters in the eleventh
and twelfth centuries had only a sovereign scorn for the
widely current astrological superstition of their time by
citing Hildebert as ridiculing the art in his <i>Mathematicus</i>.<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a>
A century later Charles Jourdain again represented Hildebert
as turning to ridicule the vain speculations of the astrologers.<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a>
Bourassé, the editor of Hildebert’s works as
they appear in Migne’s <i>Patrologia Latina</i>, seems to have felt
that the poem was scarcely an outspoken attack upon astrology
and tried to explain it as an academic exercise which
was not to be taken seriously, but regarded as satire upon
judicial astrology. Hauréau not only denied Archbishop
Hildebert’s authorship, but took the common sense view
that the poet believes fully in astrology. It would, indeed,
be difficult to detect any suggestion of ridicule or satire
about the poem. Its plot is a tragic one and it seems written
in all seriousness. Even Patricida, despite his assertion
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
that “man is not subject to the stars,” does not doubt that
he will kill his father conformably to the learned astrologer’s
prediction, if he himself continues to live. It is only by
the <i>tour de force</i> of self-slaughter that he hopes to cheat
fate.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hildebert’s
Hermaphrodite’s
horoscope.</div>

<p>Even Archbishop Hildebert shows a tendency towards
astrology in other poems attributed to him; for example,
in his <i>Nativity of Christ</i> and in a short poem, <i>The Hermaphrodite</i>,
which reads as follows, representing the fulfillment
of a horoscope:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“While my pregnant mother bore me in the womb, ’tis
said the gods deliberated what she should bring forth.
Phoebus said, ‘It is a boy’; Mars, ‘A girl’; Juno, ‘Neither.’
So when I was born, I was a hermaphrodite. When I
seek to die, the goddess says, ‘He shall be slain by a
weapon’; Mars, ‘By crucifixion’; Phoebus, ‘By drowning.’
So it turned out. A tree shades the water; I climb it; the
sword I carry by chance slips from its scabbard; I myself
fall upon it; my trunk is impaled in the branches; my
head falls into the river. Thus I, man, woman, and
neither, suffered flood, sword, and cross.”<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a></p>
</div>

<p>This poem has always been greatly admired by students of
Latin literature for its epigrammatic neatness and conciseness,
and has been thought too good to be the work of a
medieval writer, and has been even attributed to Petronius.
Another version, by the medieval poet, Peter Riga, entitled
<i>De ortu et morte pueri monstruosi</i>, is longer and far less
elegant. Hauréau, however, regarded <i>the Hermaphrodite</i>
as a medieval composition, since there are no manuscripts
of it earlier than the twelfth century; but he was in doubt
whether to ascribe it to Hildebert or to Matthew of Vendôme,
who in listing his own poems mentions <i>hic et haec
hermaphroditus homo</i>.<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span></p><div class="sidenote">The art of
geomancy.</div>

<p>We turn to the association of the name of Bernard
Silvester with the superstitious art of geomancy. It may
be briefly defined as a method of divination in which, by
marking down a number of points at random and then connecting
or cancelling them by lines, a number or figure is
obtained which is used as a key to sets of tables or to
astrological constellations. The only reason for calling this
geomancy, that is, divination by means of the element earth,
would seem to be that at first the marks were made and
figures drawn in the sand or dust, like those of Archimedes
during the siege of Syracuse. But by the middle ages, at
least, any kind of writing material would do as well. Although
a somewhat more abstruse form of superstition
than the ouija board, it seems to have been nearly as popular
in the medieval period as the ouija board is now.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Prologue
of the
<i>Experimentarius</i>.</div>

<p>The name of Bernard Silvester is persistently associated
in the manuscripts with a work bearing the title <i>Experimentarius</i>,
which seems to consist of sets of geomantic tables
translated from the Arabic. Its prologue is unmistakable,
but it is less easy to make out what text should go with it
and how the text should be arranged. Sometimes the prologue
is found alone in the manuscripts,<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> and the text which
accompanies it in others varies in amount and sometimes
is more or less mixed up with other similar modes of divination.
The prologue is sometimes headed, <i>Evidencia operis
subsequentis</i>, and regularly subdivides into three brief sections.
The first, opening with the words, <i>Materia huius
libelli</i>, describes the subject-matter of the text as “the effect
and efficacy of the moon and other planets and of the constellations,
which they exert upon inferior things.” The
writer’s opinion is that God permits mortals who make sane
and sober inquiry to learn by subtle consideration of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
constellations many things concerning the future and persons
who are absent, and that astrology also gives information
concerning human character, health and sickness, prosperity,
fertility of the soil, the state of sea and air, business
matters and journeys. In a second paragraph, opening,
<i>Utilitas autem huius libelli</i>, the writer states that the use
of his book is that one may avoid the perils of which the
stars give warning by penitence and prayers and vows to
God who, as the astrologer Albumasar admits, controls the
stars. And through them the Creator reveals his will, as in
the case of the three Magi who learned from a star that a
great prophet had been born. Finally, in a paragraph of a
single sentence, which opens with the words, <i>Titulus vero
talis est</i>, we are informed that the title is the <i>Experimentarius</i>
of Bernard Silvester, “not because he was the original author
but the faithful translator from Arabic into Latin.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pictures
of Bernard
Silvester.</div>

<p>In one manuscript which contains the <i>Experimentarius</i>
there is twice depicted, although the second time in different
colors, a seated human figure evidently intended to represent
Bernard Silvester. He is bearded and sits in a chair
writing, with a pen in one hand and a knife or scalpel in
the other. Neither miniature is in juxtaposition to the prologue
in which Bernard is named, but in both cases the
figure is accompanied by five lines of text, written alternately
in red and blue colors and proclaiming that Bernard Silvester
is the translator and that the number seven is the basis
in this infallible book of lot-casting.<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> It would not be safe,
however, to accept this miniature as an accurate representation
of Bernard, since the manuscript is not contemporary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
and it contains similar portraits of Socrates and Plato,
Pythagoras, Anaxagoras, and Cicero.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Problem
of a spying-tube
and Hermann’s
relation
to the
<i>Experimentarius</i>.</div>

<p>Both in the manuscript which we have just been describing
and another of older date<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> is a picture of two persons
seated. In both manuscripts one is called Euclid, in
the older manuscript only is the other named, and designated
as Hermann. According to Black’s description
Euclid “uplifts a sphere with his right hand, and with his
left holds a telescope through which he is observing the
stars; towards whom ‘Hermannus,’ on the other side, holds
forth a circular instrument hanging from his fingers, which
is superscribed ‘Astrolabium.’” The picture in the other
manuscript is similar, but in view of the fact that they were
written in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, the rod
along which, or tube through which ‘Euclid’ is squinting,
can scarcely be regarded as a telescope without more definite
proof of the invention of that instrument before the time
of Galileo. Perhaps it is a <i>dioptra</i><a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> or spying-tube of the
sort described by the ancients, Polybius and Hero, and used
in surveying. But I mention the picture for the further
reason that Clerval<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> asserted a connection between Hermann
of Dalmatia, the twelfth century translator, and Bernard
Silvester, affirming that Hermann sent Bernard his work on
the uses of the astrolabe and that he really translated the
<i>Experimentarius</i> from the Arabic and sent it to Bernard
who merely versified it. But we have already proved that
it was Hermann the Lame of the eleventh century who
wrote on the astrolabe and that he did so a century before
Bernard Silvester. The aforesaid picture is clearly of him
and not of Hermann the Dalmatian. And whether the “B”
at whose request Hermann wrote on the astrolabe be meant
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
for Berengarius or Bernard, it certainly cannot be meant
for Bernard Silvester, who was not born yet.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Text
of the
<i>Experimentarius</i>.</div>

<p>Apparently the text proper of the <i>Experimentarius</i> opens
with the usual instructions of geomancies for the chance
casting of points and drawing of lines. The number of
points left over as a result of this procedure is used as a
guide in finding the answer to the question which one has
in mind. In a preliminary table are listed 28 subjects of
inquiry such as life and death, marriage, imprisonment,
enemies, gain. One turns to the topic in which one is interested
and, according as the number of points obtained
by chance is over or under seven, reckons forward or backward
that many times from the number opposite his theme
of inquiry, or, if exactly seven points were left over,
takes the number of the theme of inquiry as he finds it.
In one manuscript the new number thus obtained is that
of the “Judge of the Fates” to whom one should next
turn. There are 28 such judges, whose names are the
Arabic designations for the 28 divisions of the circle of the
zodiac or mansions of the moon, which spends a day
in each of them.<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> A page is devoted to each judge, under
whose name are twenty-eight lines containing as many responses
to the twenty-eight subjects of inquiry. The inquirer
selects a line corresponding to his number of points
and the tables are so arranged that he thus always receives
the answer which fits his inquiry. But most of the manuscripts,
instead of at once referring the inquirer to his
Judge as we have described, insert other preliminary tables
in which he is first referred to a planet and then to a day
of the moon. This unnecessarily indirect and complicated
system is probably intended to mystify the reader and to
emphasize further the supposedly astrological basis of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
procedure, whereas it is in reality purely a matter of lot-casting.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Two
versions
of the 28
judges.</div>

<p>Now in most of the manuscripts which I have examined
there are two versions of these twenty-eight pages of Judges
of the Fates, worded differently, although the corresponding
lines always seem to answer the same questions and apply
to the same topics of inquiry as before. In the version which
comes first, for example, the first line under the first Judge,
<i>Almazene</i> or the belly of Aries, is</p>

<p class="center"><i>Tuum indumentum durabit tempore longo</i></p>

<p>while in the second version the same line reads,</p>

<p class="center"><i>Hoc ornamentum decus est et fama ferentum.</i>
<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a>
</p>

<p>Both versions seem to be regarded as the <i>Experimentarius</i>
of Bernard Silvester, for in the manuscripts where they
occur together the first usually follows its prologue, while
the second is preceded by his picture and the line, <i>Translator
Bernardus Silvester</i>.<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> In one manuscript<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> the prologue
is immediately followed by the second version and
the first set of Judges does not occur. In some manuscripts,<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a>
however, the second version occurs without the
first and without the prologue, in which cases, I think, there
is nothing to indicate that it is by Bernard Silvester or a
part of the <i>Experimentarius</i>. The first version ends in several
manuscripts with the words, <i>Explicit libellus de constellationibus</i><a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a>
rather than some such phrase as <i>Explicit Experimentarius</i>.
Furthermore in some manuscripts where it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
occurs alone this first set of Judges is called the book of
Alchandiandus or Alkardianus.<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> He may, however, have
been the Arabic author and Bernard his translator, and the
<i>liber alkardiani phylosophi</i> opens in at least one manuscript
with words appropriate to the title, <i>Experimentarius</i>, “Since
everything that is tested by experience is experienced either
for its own sake or on some other account.”<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Other
modes of
divination.</div>

<p>There are so many treatises of this type in medieval
manuscripts and they are so frequently collected in one
<i>codex</i> that they are liable to be confused with one another.
Thus in two manuscripts a method of divination ascribed
to the physician of King Amalricus<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> is in such juxtaposition
to the <i>Experimentarius</i> that Macray takes it to be part
of the <i>Experimentarius</i>, while the catalogue of the Sloane
Manuscripts combines the two as “a compilation ‘concerning
the art of Ptolemy.’” Macray also includes in the <i>Experimentarius</i>
a <i>Praenostica Socratis Basilei</i>, which is of frequent
occurrence in the manuscripts, and other treatises on
divination which are either anonymous or ascribed to
Pythagoras and, judging from the miniatures prefixed to
them, to Anaxagoras and Cicero, who thus again is appropriately
punished for having written a work against divination.
I doubt if these other modes of divination are parts
of the <i>Experimentarius</i>, which often is found without them,
as are some of them without it. But they are so much like it
in general form and procedure that we may consider them
now, especially as they are of such dubious date and authorship
that it would be difficult to place them more exactly.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Divination
of the
physician
of King
Amalricus.</div>

<p>The treatise which is assigned to the physician of King
Amalricus and which is said to have been composed in
memory of that monarch’s great victory over the Saracens
and Turks in Egypt, obtains its key number by revolution
of a wheel<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> rather than by the geomantic casting of points,
and introduces a trifle more of astrological observance. If
on first applying the inquirer receives an unfavorable reply,
he may wait for thirty days and try again, but after the
third failure he must desist entirely. “It is not allowed to
inquire concerning one thing more than three times.” The
twenty-eight subjects of inquiry are divided in groups of
four among the seven planets, and the inquirer is told to
return on the weekday named after the planet under which
his query falls. On the day set the astrologer must further
determine with the astrolabe when the hour of the same
planet has arrived, and not until then may the divination by
means of the wheel take place, as a result of which the inquirer
is directed as before to one of 28 Judges who in this
case, however, are said to be associated with mansions of
the sun<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> rather than moon. At the close of the treatise
of the physician of King Amalricus in both manuscripts<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a>
that I have examined is inserted some sceptical person’s
opinion to the effect that these methods of divination are
subtle trifles which are not utterly useless as a means of diversion,
but that faith should not be placed in them. The
more apparent the devil’s nets are, concludes the passage,
the more wary the human bird will be.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Prenostica
Socratis
Basilei.</i></div>

<p>In the <i>Prenostica</i> or <i>Prenosticon Socratis Basilei</i>&mdash;Prognostic
of Socrates the King&mdash;a number from one to
nine is obtained by chance either by geomancy or by revolving
a wheel on which an image of “King Socrates”
points his finger. The inquirer then consults a table where
sixteen questions are so arranged in compartments designated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
by letters of the alphabet that each question is found
in two compartments. Say that the inquirer finds his question
in A and E. He then consults another table where 144
names of birds, beasts, fish, stones, herbs, flowers, cities, and
other “species” are arranged in nine rows opposite the numbers
from one to nine and in sixteen columns headed by the
sixteen possible pairs of letters such as the AE of our inquirer.
Looking in the row corresponding to his number
and the column AE he obtains a name. He must then find
this name in a series of twelve circular tables where the
aforesaid names are listed under their proper species, each
table containing twelve names. He now is referred on to
one of sixteen kings of the Turks, India, Spain, Francia,
Babylonia, the Saracens, Romania, etc. Under each king
nine answers are listed and here at last under his original
number obtained by lot he finds the appropriate answer.<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Further
modes of
divination.</div>

<p>In the <i>Prenostica Pitagorice</i> we are assured that we may
rest easy as to the integrity of the Catholic Faith being observed,
“for that does not happen of necessity which human
caution forewarned, can avoid.” It answers any one of a
list of thirty-six questions by means of a number obtained
by chance between one and twelve. The inquirer is referred
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
to one of 36 birds whose pictures are drawn in the margins
with twelve lines of answers opposite each bird. Other
schemes of divination found with the <i>Experimentarius</i> in
some manuscripts differ from the foregoing only in the number
of questions concerning which inquiry can be made, the
number of Judges and the names given them, the number of
lines under each Judge, and the number of intermediate
directory tables that have to be consulted before the final
Judge is reached. As Judges we meet the twelve sons of
Jacob, the thirty-six decans or thirds of the twelve signs,
and another astrological group of twenty made up of the
twelve signs, seven planets, and the dragon.<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Experimental
character
of
geomancy.</div>

<p>In one manuscript<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> the directions for consulting this
last group of Judges are given under the heading, <i>Documentum
experimenti retrogradi</i>, which like Bernard’s <i>Experimentarius</i>
suggests the experimental character of the art of
geomancy or the arts of divination in general. Later we
shall hear Albertus Magnus in the <i>Speculum astronomiae</i>
call treatises of aerimancy,<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> pyromancy, and hydromancy, as
well as of geomancy “experimental books.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Various
other geomancies.</div>

<p>Geomancies are of frequent occurrence in libraries of
medieval manuscripts.<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> Many are anonymous<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> but others
bear the names of noted men of learning. The art must have
had great currency among the Arabs,<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> for not only are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
treatises current in Latin under such names as Abdallah,<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a>
Albedatus,<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> Alcherius,<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> Alkindi,<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> and Alpharinus,<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> but almost
every prominent translator of the time seems to have
tried his hand at a geomancy. In the manuscripts we find
geomancies attributed to Gerard of Cremona,<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> Plato of
Tivoli,<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> Michael Scot,<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> Hugo Sanctelliensis,<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> William of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
Moerbeke,<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> William de Saliceto of Piacenza,<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> and Peter
of Abano,<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> and even to their medical confrère and contemporary,
Bernard Gordon, who is not usually classed as a
translator.<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> Some of these, however, were translators
from the Greek or the Hebrew rather than Arabic, and some
of the geomantic treatises in the manuscripts claim an origin
from India.<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> But a Robert or Roger Scriptoris who compiled
a geomancy towards the close of the medieval period
thinks first among his sources of “the Arabs of antiquity
and the wise moderns, William of Moerbeke, Bartholomew
of Parma, Gerard of Cremona, and many others.”<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> These
other geomancies are not necessarily like the <i>Experimentarius</i>
of Bernard Silvester<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> and we shall describe another
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
sort when we come to speak of Bartholomew of Parma in
a later chapter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Interest of
statesmen
and clergy
in the art.</div>

<p>In the fifteenth century such intellectual statesmen as
Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, and Henry VII of England
displayed an interest in geomancy, judging from a manuscript
<i>de luxe</i> of Guido Bonatti’s work on astrology which
was made for Henry VII and contains a picture of him, and
also Plato’s translation of the geomancy of Alpharinus and
geomantic “tables of Humphrey, duke of Gloucester.”<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a>
The interest of the clergy in this superstitious art is attested
not only by the translation of such a person as William of
Moerbeke, who was papal penitentiary and later archbishop
of Corinth, but by a geomancy which we find in two fifteenth
century manuscripts written by Martin, an abbot of Burgos,
at the request of another abbot of Paris.<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> Treatises on
geomancy continue to be found in the manuscripts as late as
the eighteenth century, that of Gerard of Cremona especially.</p>

was probably induced to regard
everything in Digby 46 up to fol.
92r as <i>Experimentarius</i> by the picture
of Bernard Silvester which
occurs at fol. 1v with the accompanying
five lines stating that he
is the translator of “this infallible

<p><a id="Footnote_313" href="#FNanchor_313" class="label">[313]</a> I have described the <i>Prenostica</i>
as it is found in Digby 46,
fol. 40r-, with a picture at fol.
41v of Socrates seated and Plato
standing behind him and pointing.
Ashmole 304 has the same
text and picture; and the text is
practically the same in Sloane
3857, fols. 196-207, “<i>Documentum
subsequentis considerationis quae
Socratica dicitur</i>.” In Additional
15236, 13-14th century, fols. 95r-108r,
the inquirer is first directed
to implore divine aid and repeat
a Paternoster and Ave Maria, and
some details are slightly different,
but the general method is identical.
The final answers are given
in French. In BN 7420A, 14th
century, fol. 126r- (or clxxxxvi,
or col. 451), “<i>Liber magni solacii
socratis philosophi</i>” is also essentially
the same; indeed, its opening
words are, “<i>Pronosticis Socratis
basilii</i>.” Preceding it are
similar methods of divination,
beginning at fol. 121v (or clxxxxii
or col. 440), “<i>Si vis operare de
geomancia debes facere quatuor
lineas....</i>” Evidently the following
is also our treatise: CU
Trinity 1404 (IV), 14-15th century,
<i>Iste liber dicitur Rota fortune
in qua sunt 16 questiones
determinate in pronosticis sententiat’</i>.
(sic) <i>basilici que sub sequentibus
inscribuntur et sunt 12
spere et 16 Reges pro iudicibus
constituti et habent determinare
veritatem de questionibus antedictis
cum auxilio sortium</i>. James
(III, 423) adds, “The questions,
tables, spheres, and Kings follow....”
Our treatise is also
listed in John Whytefeld’s 1389
catalogue of MSS in Dover
Priory, No. 409, fol. 192v, <i>Pronostica
socratis phi</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Was
Hildegard
influenced
by Bernard
Silvester?</div>

<p>The discussion of macrocosm and microcosm, <i>nous</i> and
<i>hyle</i>, by Bernard Silvester in the <i>De mundi universitate</i> is
believed by Dr. Charles Singer, in a recent essay on “The
Scientific Views and Visions of Saint Hildegard,” to have
influenced her later writings, such as the <i>Liber vitae meritorum</i>
and the <i>Liber divinorum operum</i>. He writes “The
work of Bernard ... corresponds so closely both in form,
in spirit, and sometimes even in phraseology to the <i>Liber
divinorum operum</i> that it appears to us certain that Hildegard
must have had access to it.”<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> Without subscribing unreservedly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
to this view, we pass on from the Platonist and
geomancer of Tours to the Christian “sibyl of the Rhine.”<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span></p><div class="sidenote">Her personality
and reputation.</div>

<p>From repeated statements in the prefaces to Hildegard’s
works, in which she tells exactly when she wrote them and
how old she was at the time,&mdash;for not only was she not
reticent on this point but her different statements of her age
at different times are all consistent with one another&mdash;it
is evident that she was born in 1098. Her birthplace was
near Sponheim. From the age of five, she tells us in the
<i>Scivias</i>, she had been subject to visions which did not come
to her in her sleep but in her wakeful hours, yet were not
seen or heard with the eyes and ears of sense. During her
lifetime she was also subject to frequent illness, and very
likely there was some connection between her state of health
and her susceptibility to visions. She spent her life from
her eighth year in religious houses along the Nahe river,
and in 1147 became head of a nunnery at its mouth opposite
Bingen, the place with which her name was henceforth connected.
She became famed for her cures of diseases as well
as her visions and ascetic life, and it is Kaiser’s opinion that
her medical skill contributed more to her popular reputation
for saintliness than all her writings. At any rate she became
very well known, and her prayers and predictions were
much sought after. Thomas Becket, who seems to have
been rather too inclined to pry into the future, as we shall
see later, wrote asking for “the visions and oracles of that
sainted and most celebrated Hildegard,” and inquiring
whether any revelation had been vouchsafed her as to the
duration of the existing papal schism. “For in the days of
Pope Eugenius she predicted that not until his last days
would he have peace and grace in the city.”<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> It is very
doubtful whether St. Bernard visited her monastery and
called the attention of Pope Eugenius III to her visions,
but her letters<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> show her in correspondence with St.
Bernard and several popes and emperors, with numerous
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
archbishops and bishops, abbots and other potentates, to
whom she did not hesitate to administer reproofs and warnings.
For this purpose and to aid in the repression of
heresy she also made tours from Bingen to various parts of
Germany. There is some disagreement whether she died in
1179 or 1180.<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> Proceedings were instituted by the pope in
1233 to investigate her claims to sainthood, but she seems
never to have been formally canonized. Gebenon, a Cistercian
prior in Eberbach, made a compendium from her
<i>Scivias</i>, <i>Liber divinorum operum</i>, and <i>Letters</i>, “because few
can own or read her works.”<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Dates of
Hildegard’s
works.</div>

<p>As was stated above, we can date some of Hildegard’s
works with exactness. In her preface to the one entitled
<i>Scivias</i><a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> she says that in the year 1141, when she was forty-two
years and seven months old, a voice from heaven bade
her commit her visions to writing. She adds that she
scarcely finished the book in ten years, so we infer that she
was working at it from 1141 to 1150. This fits exactly
with what she tells us in the preface to the <i>Liber vitae
meritorum</i>, which she was divinely instructed to write in
1158, when she was sixty years old. Moreover, she says
that the eight years preceding, that is from 1151 to 1158,
had been spent in writing other treatises which also appear
to have been revealed in visions and among which were
“<i>subtilitates diversarum naturarum creaturarum</i>,” the title
of another of her works with which we shall be concerned.
On the <i>Liber vitae meritorum</i> she spent five years, so it
should have been completed by 1163. In that year, the
preface to the <i>Liber divinorum operum</i> informs us,&mdash;and
the sixty-fifth year of her life&mdash;a voice instructed her to
begin its composition, and seven more years were required
to complete it. This leaves undated only one of the five
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
works by her which we shall consider, namely, the <i>Causae
et curae</i>, or <i>Liber compositae medicinae</i> as it is sometimes
called, while the <i>Subtilitates diversarum naturarum creaturarum</i>
bears a corresponding alternative title, <i>Liber
simplicis medicinae</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Question
of their
genuineness.</div>

<p>“Some would impugn the genuineness of all her writings,”
says the article on Hildegard in <i>The Catholic Encyclopedia</i>,
“but without sufficient reason.”<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> Kaiser, who
edited the <i>Causae et curae</i>, had no doubt that both it and
the <i>Subtilitates</i> were genuine works. Recently Singer has
excluded them both from his discussion of Hildegard’s scientific
views on the ground that they are probably spurious,
but his arguments are unconvincing. His objection that
they are full of German expressions which are absent in her
other works is of little consequence, since it would be natural
to employ vernacular proper names for homely herbs and
local fish and birds and common ailments, while in works
of an astronomical and theological character like her other
visions there would be little reason for departing from the
Latin. Anyway Hildegard’s own assertion in the preface
of the <i>Liber vitae meritorum</i> is decisive that she wrote that
work. The almost contemporary biography of her also
states that she wrote “certain things concerning the nature
of man and the elements, and of diverse creatures,”<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> which
may be a blanket reference to the <i>Causae et curae</i> as well as
the <i>Subtilitates diversarum naturarum creaturarum</i>. The
records which we have of the proceedings instituted by the
pope in 1233 to investigate Hildegard’s title to sainthood
mention both the <i>Liber simplicis medicinae</i> and <i>Liber compositae
medicinae</i> as her works; and later in the same century
Matthew of Westminster ascribed both treatises to her, stating
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
further that the <i>Liber simplicis medicinae secundum
creationem</i> was in eight books and giving the full title of
the other as <i>Liber compositae medicinae de aegritudinum
causis signis et curis</i>.<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> Kaiser has pointed out a number of
parallel passages in it and the <i>Subtilitates</i>, while its introductory
cosmology seems to me very similar to that of
Hildegard’s other three works. Indeed, as we consider the
contents of these five works together, it will become evident
that the same peculiar views and personality run through
them all.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Question
of Hildegard’s
knowledge
of Latin.</div>

<p>In the preface to the <i>Liber vitae meritorum</i> Hildegard
speaks of a man and a girl who gave her some assistance
in writing out her visions.<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> From such passages in her own
works and from statements of her biographers and other
writers<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> it has been inferred that she was untrained in
Latin grammar and required literary assistance.<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> Or sometimes
it is said that she miraculously became able to speak
and write Latin without having ever been instructed in that
language.<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> Certainly the <i>Causae et curae</i> is a lucid, condensed,
and straightforward presentation which it would
be very difficult to summarize or excerpt. One must read
it all, for further condensation is impossible. One can
hardly say as much for her other works, but a new critical
edition of them such as the <i>Causae et curae</i> has enjoyed
might result in an improvement of the style. But our concern
is rather with their subject-matter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Subject-matter
of
Hildegard’s
works.</div>

<p>Three of the five works which we shall consider are
written out in the form of visions, and are primarily religious
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
in their contents but contain considerable cosmology
and some human anatomy, as well as some allusions to
magic and astrology. The other two deal primarily with
medicine and natural science, and give no internal indication
of having been revealed in visions, presenting their
material in somewhat didactic manner, and being divided
into books and chapters, like other medieval treatises on the
same subjects. As printed in Migne, the <i>Subtleties of
Different Natural Creatures</i> or <i>Book of Medicinal
Simples</i> is in nine books dealing respectively with plants,
elements, trees, stones, fish, birds, animals, reptiles, and
metals. In this arrangement there is no plan evident<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> and
it would seem more logical to have the books on plants and
trees and stones and metals together. In Schott’s edition
of 1533 the discussion of stones was omitted&mdash;perhaps
properly, since Matthew of Westminster spoke of but eight
books&mdash;and the remaining topics were grouped in four books
instead of eight as in Migne. First came the elements, then
metals, then a third book treating of plants and trees, and
a fourth book including all sorts of animals.<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> That the
<i>Subtleties</i> was a widely read and influential work is indicated
by the number of manuscripts of it listed by Schmelzeis
and Kaiser. Of the five books of the <i>Causae et curae</i>
the first, beginning with the creation of the universe, Hyle,
the creation of the angels, fall of Lucifer, and so forth,
deals chiefly with celestial phenomena and the waters of
the sea and firmament. The second combines some discussion
of Adam and Eve and the deluge with an account of
the four elements and humors, human anatomy, and various
other natural phenomena.<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> With book three the listing of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
cures begins and German words appear occasionally in
the text.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Relations
between
science
and
religion
in them.</div>

<p>So much attention to the Biblical story of creation and of
Adam and Eve as is shown in the first two books of the
<i>Causae et curae</i> might give one the impression that Hildegard’s
natural science is highly colored by and entirely subordinated
to a religious point of view. But this is not quite
the impression that one should take away. A notable thing
about even her religious visions is the essential conformity
of their cosmology and physiology to the then prevalent
theories of natural science. The theory of four elements,
the hypothesis of concentric spheres surrounding the earth,
the current notions concerning veins and humors, are introduced
with slight variations in visions supposed to be
of divine origin. In matters of detail Hildegard may make
mistakes, or at least differ from the then more generally
accepted view, and she displays no little originality in giving
a new turn to some of the familiar concepts, as in her
five powers of fire, four of air, fifteen of water, and seven
of earth.<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> But she does not evolve any really new principles
of nature. Possibly it is the spiritual application of
these scientific verities that is regarded as the pith of the
revelation, but Hildegard certainly says that she sees the
natural facts in her visions. The hypotheses of past and
contemporary natural science, somewhat obscured or distorted
by the figurative and mystical mode of description
proper to visions, are embodied in a saint’s reveries and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
utilized in inspired revelation. Science serves religion, it
is true, but religion for its part does not hesitate to accept
science.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Peculiar
views
concerning
winds
and rivers.</div>

<p>We cannot take the time to note all of Hildegard’s
minor variations from the natural science of her time, but
may note one or two characteristic points in which her
views concerning the universe and nature seem rather daring
and unusual, not to say crude and erroneous. In the <i>Scivias</i>
she represents a blast and lesser winds as emanating from
each of four concentric heavens which she depicts as surrounding
the earth, namely, a sphere of fire, a shadowy
sphere like a skin, a heaven of pure ether, and a region of
watery air under it.<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> In the <i>Liber divinorum operum</i> she
speaks of winds which drive the firmament from east to
west and the planets from west to east.<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> In the <i>Subtilitates</i>
Hildegard seems to entertain the strange notion that rivers
are sent forth from the sea like the blood in the veins of
the human body.<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> One gets the impression that the rivers
flow up-hill toward their sources, since one reads that “the
Rhine is sent forth by the force of the sea”<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> and that
“some rivers go forth from the sea impetuously, others
slowly according to the winds.”</p>

<p>Since Hildegard lived on the Nahe or Rhine all her life
she must indeed have been absorbed in her visions and
monastic life not to have learned in which direction a river
flows; and perhaps we should supply the explanation, which
she certainly does not expressly give in the <i>Subtilitates</i>,
that the sea feeds the rivers by evaporation or through subterranean
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
passages. Perhaps a passage in the <i>Causae et
curae</i> may be taken as a correction or explanation of the
preceding assertions, in which case that work would seem
to be of later date than the <i>Subtilitates</i>. In it too Hildegard
states that “springs and rivers” which “flow from the sea”
are better in the east than in the west, but her next sentence
straightway adds that they are salt and leave a salt deposit
on the sands where they flow which is medicinal.<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> The
waters rising from the southern sea are also spoken of by
her as salt.<a id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> Even in the <i>Causae et curae</i> she speaks of the
water of the great sea which surrounds the world as forming
a sort of flank to the waters above the firmament.<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Suggestions
concerning
drinking-water.</div>

<p>On the subject of whether waters are wholesome to
drink or not Hildegard comes a trifle nearer the truth and
somewhat reminds us of the discussions of the same subject
in Pliny and Vitruvius.<a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> She says that swamp water should
always be boiled,<a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> that well water is better to drink than
spring-water and spring-water than river water, which
should be boiled and allowed to cool before drinking;<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> that
rain-water is inferior to spring-water<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> and that drinking
snow-water is dangerous to the health.<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> The salt waters
of the west she regards as too turbid, while the fresh waters
of the west are not warmed sufficiently by the sun and should
be boiled and allowed to cool before using.<a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> The salt
waters arising from the south sea are venomous from the
presence in them of worms and small animals. Southern
fresh waters have been purged by the heat, but make the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
flesh of men fatty and of black color.<a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> Hildegard is not
the first author to advise the boiling of drinking-water,<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> but
she certainly lays great stress on this point.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The devil
as the
negative
principle.</div>

<p>While the scheme of the universe put forward by ancient
and medieval science is, as we have seen, on the whole
adopted even in Hildegard’s most visionary writings, it is
equally true that the religious interest is by no means absent
from her two works of medicine and natural history. In
the first place, the devil is a force in nature which she often
mentions. Her opening the <i>Causae et curae</i> with a discussion
of creation&mdash;of course a usual starting-point with
the medieval scientist&mdash;soon leads her to speak of the fall
of Lucifer. She has a rather good theory that Lucifer in
his perverse will strove to raise himself to Nothing, and
that since what he wished to do was Nothing, he fell into
nothingness and could not stand because he could find no
foundation under him.<a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> But after the devil was unable to
create anything out of nothing and fell from heaven, God
created the firmament and sun, moon, and stars to show how
great He was and to make the devil realize what glory he
had lost.<a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> Other creatures who willingly join themselves to
the devil lose their own characteristics and become nothing.<a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a>
Lucifer himself is not permitted to move from Tartarus or
he would upset the elements and celestial bodies, but a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
throng of demons of varying individual strength plot with
him against the universe.<a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> But in other passages Hildegard
seems to admit freely the influence, if not the complete presence,
of the devil in nature. And he has the power of deceiving
by assumed appearances, as Adam was seduced by
the serpent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Natural
substances
and evil
spirits.</div>

<p>Indeed, the dragon to this day hates mankind and has
such a nature and such diabolical arts in itself that sometimes
when it emits its fiery breath, the spirits of the air
disturb the air.<a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> This illustrates a common feature of
Hildegard’s natural history and pharmacy; namely, the association
of natural substances with evil spirits either in
friendly or hostile relationships. In the preface to the first
book of the <i>Subtleties</i> she states that some herbs cannot be
endured by demons, while there are others of which the
devil is fond and to which he joins himself. In mandragora,
for example, “the influence of the devil is more present than
in other herbs; consequently man is stimulated by it according
to his desires, whether they be good or bad.”<a id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> On the
other hand, the holm-oak is hostile to the spirits of the air;
one who sleeps under its shade is free from diabolical illusions,
and fumigating a house with it drives out the evil
spirits.<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> Certain fish, too, have the property of expelling
demons, whether one eats them or burns their livers or
bones.<a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> Finally, stones and metals have their relations to
evil spirits. It is advisable for a woman in childbirth to
hold the gem jasper in her hand, “in order that malignant
spirits of the air may be the less able to harm her and her
child; for the tongue of the ancient serpent extends itself
towards the perspiration of the child, as it emerges from
the mother’s womb.”<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> Not only does the touch of red-hot
steel weaken the force of poison in food or drink, but that
metal also signifies the divinity of God, and the devil flees
from and avoids it.<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span></p><div class="sidenote">Stars and
fallen
angels:
sin and
nature.</div>

<p>It is perhaps not very surprising that we should find
in Hildegard’s works notions concerning nature which we
met back in the Enoch literature, since some of her writings
take the same form of recorded visions as Enoch’s, while
one of them, the <i>Liber vitae meritorum</i>, is equally apocalyptic.
At any rate, in the <i>Scivias</i> in the second vision,
where Lucifer is cast out of glory because of his pride, the
fallen angels are seen as a great multitude of stars, as in
the <i>Book of Enoch</i>, and we are told that the four elements
were in harmony before Lucifer’s fall.<a id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> The disturbing
effect of sin, even human, upon nature is again stated in
the <i>Causae et curae</i>, where it is said that normally the elements
serve man quietly and perform his works. But when
men engage in wars and give way to hate and envy, the
elements are apt to rage until men repent and seek after
God again.<a id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> In the <i>Liber vitae meritorum</i>, too, the elements
complain that they are overturned and upset by human
depravity and iniquity.<a id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Nature
in Adam’s
time: the
antediluvian
period.</div>

<p>The influence of the Christian religion is further shown
and that of the Bible in particular is manifested by numerous
allusions to Adam and the earliest period of Biblical
history, but very few of them find any justification in the
scriptural narrative. Thus the <i>Liber divinorum operum</i>
states<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> that after the fall of Adam and before the deluge
the sun and moon and planets and other stars were “somewhat
turbulent from excessive heat,” and that the men of
that time possessed great bodily strength in order that they
might endure this heat. The deluge reduced the temperature
and men since have been weaker. In the preface to
the fifth book of the <i>Subtleties</i> we are told that there are
certain plants which fish eat, and which, if man could procure
and eat, would enable him to go without food for four
or five months. Adam used to eat them at times after he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
had been cast out of Eden, but not when he could get
enough other food, as they make the flesh tough. In the
preface to the eighth book Hildegard says that all creatures
were good before Adam’s fall, but when Abel’s blood stained
the soil noxious humors arose from which venomous and
deadly reptiles were generated. These perished in the
deluge, but others were generated from their putrefying
carcasses. In the <i>Causae et curae</i>, too, the names of Adam
and Eve occasionally appear in the chapter headings, for
instance, “Of Adam’s fall and of melancholy.”<a id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Spiritual
lessons
from
natural
phenomena.</div>

<p>Hildegard also held the view, common among medieval
Christian writers, that one purpose of the natural world about
us is to illustrate the spiritual world and life to come, and
that invisible and eternal truths may be manifested in visible
and temporal objects. In the <i>Scivias</i> she hears a voice
from heaven saying, “God who established all things by
His will, created them to make His Name known and
honored, not only moreover showing in the same what are
visible and temporal, but also manifesting in them what are
invisible and eternal.”<a id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> But neither Hildegard nor medieval
Christians in general thought that the only purpose of
natural phenomena and science was to illustrate spiritual
truth and point a moral. But this always constituted a good
excuse which sounded well when one of the clergy wished
to investigate or write about things of nature. Not that
we mean to question the sincerity of the medieval writers
one whit more than that of certain “Christian colleges” of
the present which deem it wise to demonstrate their piety
and orthodoxy by maintaining compulsory chapel attendance
and holding an occasional “Convocation.” But certainly
our abbess of Bingen in the course of her writings,
especially the <i>Subtleties</i> and <i>Causae et curae</i>, lists many
natural phenomena and medical recipes without making
any mention of what spiritual truth they may or may not
illustrate.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Hildegard’s
attitude
toward
magic.</div>

<p>Associating natural substances as much with the devil
or spirits of the air as she does, it is not surprising that
Hildegard believes in the reality of magic and has something
to say about it. Magic is regarded by Hildegard as
an evil and diabolical art. She describes it in a vision of
the <i>Scivias</i>, where God Himself is represented as speaking,
as the art of seeing and hearing the devil, which was taught
to men by Satan himself.<a id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> Similarly in the <i>Liber divinorum
operum</i> it is stated that Antichrist will excel “in all diabolical
arts” and in “the magic art.”<a id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> This was of course
the usual Christian view. In the <i>Liber vitae meritorum</i>
with more apparent originality Magic or <i>Maleficium</i> is presented
as one of the personified Vices and is allowed to
speak for itself. It is represented as having the body of
a dog, the head of a wolf, and the tail of a lion. This
beast or image speaks in its own praise and defense as
follows.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Magic
Art’s
defense.</div>

<p>“Of Mercury and other philosophers I will say many
things, who by their investigations harnessed the elements
in such wise that they discovered most certainly everything
that they wished. Those very daring and very wise men
learned such things partly from God and partly from evil
spirits. And why shouldn’t they? And they named the
planets after themselves, since they had made many investigations
and learned a great deal concerning the sun and
moon and stars. I, moreover, rule and reign wherever I
list in those arts, forsooth in the heavenly luminaries, in
trees and herbs and all that grows in the earth, and in beasts
and animals upon the earth, and in worms both above and
below the earth. And on my marches who is there that
resists me? God created all things, so in these arts I do
Him no injury. For He wishes it, as is proved in His
scriptures and perfect works. And what would be the advantage,
if His works were so blind that no cause could
be studied in them? There wouldn’t be any.”<a id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span></p>
<div class="sidenote">True
Worship’s
reply to
Magic.</div>

<p>To this bold attempt of Magic to identify itself with
scientific investigation, the True Worship of God responds
with the counter question, “Whether it is more pleasing
to God to adore Him or His works?” and reminds
<i>Maleficium</i> that mere creatures which proceed from God
can give life to no one and that man is the only rational
created being. “You, moreover, O Magic Art, have the
circle without the center, and while you investigate many
problems in the circle of creation ... you have robbed
God of His very name.” This reply does not seem to separate
magic and scientific investigation or to deny Magic’s
claim that they are identical, and its force would seem about
as cogent against science as against magic. But a little
later in the same work Hildegard reverts to her former
charge that <i>maleficium</i> is “by diabolical arts,” and that its
devotees “by directing all their works to impurity turn their
science also to the pursuit of evils.” “For they name demons
as their gods and worship them instead of God.”<a id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Magic
properties
of natural
substances.</div>

<p>That magic, however diabolical it may be, does employ
natural forces and substances, is not only asserted by Magic
Art itself, but freely admitted by Hildegard in her discussions
of the properties of animals, plants, and minerals in
her other two works, the <i>Subtleties of Diverse Creatures</i>
and <i>Cases and Cures</i>. In the latter work she states that
while herbs in the east are full of virtue and have a good
odor and medicinal properties, those in the west are potent
in the magic art and for other phantasms but do not contribute
much to the health of the human body.<a id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> In the
former work she tells that the tree-toad is much employed
in diabolical arts, especially when the trees are beginning
to leaf and blossom, since at this time the spirits of the
air are especially active.<a id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> Sometimes, however, there is a
way to remove this magic virtue from a natural substance.
The root mandragora “is no longer efficacious for magic and
fantastic purposes,” if it is purified in a fountain for a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
day and a night immediately after it has been dug from
the earth.<a id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Instances
of counter-magic.</div>

<p>There are also substances which counteract magic. It
has little force in any place where a fir-tree grows, for the
spirits of the air hate and avoid such spots.<a id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> In the <i>Causae
et curae</i> Hildegard tells how to compound a powder “against
poison and against magic words.”<a id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> It also “confers health
and courage and prosperity on him who carries it with him.”
First one takes a root of geranium (<i>storkesnabil</i>) with its
leaves, two mallow plants, and seven shoots of the plantagenet.
These must be plucked at midday in the middle of
April. Then they are to be laid on moist earth and sprinkled
with water to keep them green for a while. Next they are
dried in the setting sun and in the rising sun until the third
hour, when they should once more be laid on moist earth
and sprinkled with water until noon. Then they are to be
removed and placed facing the south in the full sunshine
until the ninth hour, when they should be wrapped in a
cloth, with a stick on top to hold them in place, until a
trifle before midnight. Then the night begins to incline
towards day and all the evils of darkness and night begin
to flee. A little before midnight, therefore, they should be
transferred to a high window or placed above a door or
in some garden where the cool air may have access to them.
As soon as midnight is passed, they are to be removed once
more, pulverized with the middle finger, and put in a new
pill-box with a little <i>bisemum</i> to keep them from decaying
but not a sufficient quantity to overcome the scent of the
herbs. A little of this powder may be applied daily to the
eyes, ears, nose, and mouth, or it may be bound on the
body as an antiaphrodisiac, or it may be held over wine
without touching it but so that its odor can reach the wine,
which should then be drunk with a bit of saffron as a preventive
of indigestion, poison, magic, and so forth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span></p><div class="sidenote">Ceremony
with a
jacinth
and
wheaten
loaf.</div>

<p>In the <i>Subtilitates</i><a id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> the following procedure is recommended,
if anyone is bewitched by phantasms or magic
words so that he goes mad. Take a wheaten loaf and cut
the upper crust in the form of a cross. First draw a jacinth
through one line of the cross, saying, “May God who cast
away all the preciousness of gems from the devil when he
transgressed His precept, remove from you N. all phantasms
and magic words and free you from the ill of this madness.”
Then the jacinth is to be drawn through the other
arm of the cross and this formula is to be repeated, “As
the splendor which the devil once possessed departed from
him because of his transgression, so may this madness which
harasses N. by varied phantasies and magic arts be removed
from you and depart from you.” The ceremony is then
completed by the bewitched person eating the bread around
the cross.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hildegard’s
superstitious
procedure.</div>

<p>These two illustrations make it apparent that Hildegard
has a licit magic of her own which is every whit as superstitious
as the magic art which she condemns. It is evident
that she accepts not only marvelous and occult virtues of
natural substances such as herbs and gems, but also the
power of words and incantations, and rites and ceremonies
of a most decidedly magical character. In the second passage
this procedure assumed a Christian character, but the
plucking and drying of the herbs in the first passage perhaps
preserves the flavor of primitive Teutonic or Celtic paganism.
Nor is such superstitious procedure resorted to merely
against magic, to whose operations it forms a sort of
homeopathic counterpart. It is also employed for ordinary
medicinal purposes, and is a characteristic feature of Hildegard’s
conception of nature and whole mental attitude. This
we may further illustrate by running through the books of
the <i>Subtilitates</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Use of
herbs.</div>

<p>Except for passages connecting the devil with certain
herbs which we have already noted, Hildegard’s discussion
of vegetation is for the most part limited to medicinal properties
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
of herbs, which are effective without the addition of
fantastic ceremonial. Sometimes nevertheless the herbs are
either prepared or administered in a rather bizarre fashion.
Insanity may be alleviated, we are told, by shaving the
patient’s head and washing it in the hot water in which
<i>agrimonia</i> has been boiled, while the hot herbs themselves
are bound in a cloth first over his heart and then upon his
forehead and temples.<a id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> An unguent beneficial alike for digestive
and mental disorders is made of the bark, leaves, and
bits of the green wood of the fir-tree, combined with saliva
to half their weight. This mess is to be boiled in water
until it becomes thick, then butter is to be added, and the
whole strained through a cloth.<a id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> The mandragora root
should first be worn bound between the breast and navel for
three days and three nights, then divided in halves and these
bound on the thighs for three days and three nights. Finally
the left half of the root, which resembles the human figure,
should be pulverized, camphor added to it, and eaten.<a id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> If
a man is always sad and in the dumps, after purifying the
mandragora root in a fountain, let him take it to bed with
him, hold it so that it will be warmed by the heat of his body,
and say, “God, who madest man from the dust of the earth
without grief, I now place next me that earth which has
never transgressed”&mdash;Hildegard has already stated that the
mandragora is composed “of that earth of which Adam was
created”&mdash;“in order that my clay may feel that peace just
as Thou didst create it.” That the prayer or incantation is
more essential than the virtue of the mandragora in this
operation, is indicated by the statement that shoots of beech,
cedar, or aspen may be used instead of the mandragora.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Marvelous
virtues
of gems.</div>

<p>Other marvelous effects than routing the devil, which
Hildegard attributes to gems in the course of the fourth
book of the <i>Subtilitates</i>, are to confer intellect and science
for the day, to banish anger and dulness, bestow an equable
temper, restrain lust, cure all sorts of diseases and infirmities,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
endow with the gift of sound speech, prevent thefts at
night, and enable one to fast. These marvelous results are
produced either by merely having the stone in one’s possession,
or by holding it in the hand, placing it next the skin,
taking it to bed with one and warming it by the heat of the
body, breathing on it, holding it in the mouth especially
when fasting, suspending it about the neck, or making the
sign of the cross with it. In the cure of insanity by use
of the magnet the stone should be moistened with the patient’s
saliva and drawn across his forehead while an incantation
is repeated.<a id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> A man may be brought out of an
epileptic fit by putting an emerald in his mouth.<a id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> Having
recovered, he should remove the gem from his mouth and
say, “As the spirit of the Lord filled the earth, so may His
grace fill the temple of my body that it may never be moved.”
This ceremony is to be repeated on nine successive mornings,
and that here the gem is as important as the prayer is
indicated by the direction that the patient should have the
gem with him each time and take it out and look at it as he
repeats the incantation. Different is the procedure for
curing epilepsy by means of the gem <i>achates</i>.<a id="FNanchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> In this case
the stone should be soaked in water for three days at the
full moon; this water should be slightly warmed, and then
preserved, and all the patient’s food cooked in it <i>dum luna
tota crescat</i>. The gem should also be placed in everything
that he drinks. This astrological procedure is to be repeated
for ten months.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Remarkable
properties
of
fish.</div>

<p>We have already heard that certain fish have the property
of expelling demons. Fish also have other remarkable
virtues. The eye of a <i>copprea</i>, worn in a gold or silver ring
so that it touches one’s finger, arouses a sluggish intellect.<a id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a>
The lung of a tunny fish, taken in water, is good for a fever,
and it keeps one in good health to wear shoes and a belt
made of its skin.<a id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> Pulverized salmon bones are recommended
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
for bad teeth.<a id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> But eating the head of a <i>barbo</i>
gives one a headache and fever.<a id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> Hildegard also tells some
wonderful stories concerning the modes of generation of
different varieties of fish. In the <i>Causae et curae</i><a id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> for dimness
of the eyes it is recommended to dry some walrus skin
in the sun, soften it in pure wine, and apply it in a cloth
between the eyes at night. It should be removed at midnight
and applied only on alternate nights for a week.
“Either it will remove dimness of the eyes, or God does not
permit this to be done.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Use of the
parts of
birds.</div>

<p>To render available or to enhance the occult virtues of
birds Hildegard suggests a great amount of complicated
ceremonial. The heart of a vulture, split in two, dried before
a slow fire and in the sun, and worn sewn up in a
belt of doeskin, makes one tremble in the presence of
poison.<a id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> This is explained by the vulture’s own antipathy
to poison, which is increased and purified by the fire, sun,
and especially by the belt, for the doe is swifter and more
sensitive than other animals. Mistiness is marvelously removed
from the eyes by catching a nightingale before day-break,
adding a single drop of dew found on clean grass
to its gall, and anointing the eyebrows and lashes frequently
with the same.<a id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> Another eye-cure consists in cooking a
heron’s head in water, removing its eyes, alternately drying
them in the sun and softening them in cold water for three
successive times, pulverizing and dissolving them in wine,
and at night frequently touching the eyes and lids with the
tip of a feather dipped in this concoction.<a id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> The blood of a
crane, dried and preserved, and its right foot are employed
in varied ways to facilitate child-birth.<a id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> Hildegard also
often tells how to make a medicinal unguent by cooking some
bird in some prescribed manner and then pulverizing certain
portions of the carcass with various herbs or other animal
substances.<a id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> Even without the employment of ceremonial
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
sufficiently remarkable powers are attributed to the
bodies or parts of birds. Eating the flesh of one reduces
fat and benefits epileptics, while eating its liver is good for
melancholy.<a id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> The liver of a swan has the different property
of purifying the lungs, while the lung of a swan is a
cure for the spleen.<a id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> Again, a heron’s liver cures stomach
trouble, while a cure for spleen is to drink water in which
its bones have been stewed, and if one who is sad eats its
heart, it will make him glad.<a id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Cures
from
quadrupeds.</div>

<p>Hildegard’s chapters on quadrupeds are so delightfully
quaint that I cannot pass them over, although the properties
which she attributes to them and the methods by which their
virtues are utilized are not essentially different from those
in examples already given. The camel, however, is peculiar
in that its different humps have quite different virtues.<a id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a>
The one next to its neck has the virtues of the lion; the
second, those of the leopard; the third, those of the horse.
A cap of lion’s skin cures ailments of the head whether
physical or mental.<a id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> Deafness may be remedied by cutting
off a lion’s right ear and holding it over the patient’s ear
just long enough to warm it and to say, “Hear <i>adimacus</i> by
the living God and the keen virtue of a lion’s hearing.”
This process is to be repeated many times. The heart of a
lion is somewhat similarly employed, but without any incantation,
to make a stupid person prudent. Burying a
lion’s heart in the house is regarded as fire insurance against
its being struck by lightning, “for the lion is accustomed
to roar when he hears thunder.” Digestion is aided by
drinking water in which the dried liver of a lion has been
left for a short time. Placing a bit of the skin from between
a bear’s eyes over one’s heart removes timidity and
anxiety.<a id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> If anyone suffers from paralysis or one of those
changeable diseases which wax and wane with the moon like
lunacy, let him select a spot where an ass has been slain, or
has died a natural death, or has wallowed, and let him
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
spread a cloth on the grass or ground and repose there a
short time and sleep if he can. Afterwards you should take
him by the right hand and say, “Lazarus slept and rested
and rose again; and as Christ roused him from foul decay,
so may you rise from this perilous pestilence and the changing
phases of fever in that conjunction in which Christ applied
Himself to the alleviation of such complaints, prefiguring
that He would redeem man from his sins and raise him
from the dead.” With a brief interval of time allowed between,
the same performance is to be repeated thrice in the
same place on the same day, and then again thrice on the
next and the third days, when the patient will be cured.<a id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
unicorn,
weasel,
and
mouse.</div>

<p>The liver and skin of the unicorn have great medicinal
virtues, but that animal can never be caught except by
means of girls, for it flees from men but stops to gaze
diligently at girls, because it marvels that they have human
forms, yet no beards. “And if there are two or three girls
together, it marvels so much the more and is the more
quickly captured while its eyes are fixed on them. Moreover,
the girls employed in capturing it should be of noble,
not peasant birth, and of the middle period of adolescence.”<a id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a>
When one weasel is sick, another digs up a certain herb
and breathes and urinates on it for an hour, and then brings
it to the sick weasel who is cured by it.<a id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> But what this
herb is is unknown to men and other animals, and it would
do them no good if they did know it, since its unaided virtue
is not efficacious, nor would the action of their breath or
urine make it so. But the heart of a weasel, dried and
placed with wax in the ear, benefits headache or deafness,
and the head of a weasel, worn in two pieces in a belt next
the skin, strengthens and comforts the bearer and keeps
him from harm. The mouse, besides being responsible for
two other equally marvelous cures, is a remedy for epilepsy.
“For inasmuch as the mouse runs away from everything,
therefore it drives away the falling disease.”<a id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> It should be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
put in a dish of water, and the patient should drink some
of this water and also wash his feet and forehead in it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What animals
to eat
and wear.</div>

<p>Hildegard gives some strange advice what animal products
to eat and wear. “Sheepskins are good for human
wear, because they do not induce pride or lust or pestilence
as the skins of certain other animals do.”<a id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> Pork is not
good for either sick or healthy persons to eat, in her opinion,
while beef, on account of its intrinsic cold, is not good for a
man of cold constitution to eat.<a id="FNanchor_424" href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> On the other hand, she
recommends as edible various birds which would strike the
modern reader as disgusting.<a id="FNanchor_425" href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Insects
and
reptiles.</div>

<p>Fleas remain underground in winter but come forth to
plague mankind when the sun dries the soil in summer.
But one may be rid of them by heating some earth until it
is quite dry and then scattering it upon the bed.<a id="FNanchor_426" href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> Hildegard
also describes a complicated cure for leprosy by use of the
earth from an ant-hill.<a id="FNanchor_427" href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> If a man kills a certain venomous
snake just after it has skinned itself in the cleft of a rock,
and cautiously removes its heart and dries the same in
the sun, and then preserves it in a thin metal cover, it will
serve as an amulet. Holding it in his hand will render him
immune to venom and cheer him up if he becomes gloomy
or sorrowful.<a id="FNanchor_428" href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Animal
compounds.</div>

<p>In the <i>Causae et curae</i> Hildegard combines the virtues
of parts of a number of animals into one composite medicine
for epilepsy.<a id="FNanchor_429" href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> Four parts of dried mole’s blood are
used because the mole sometimes shows himself and sometimes
hides, like the epilepsy itself. Two parts of powdered
duck’s bill are added because the duck’s strength is in its
beak, “and because it touches both pure and impure things
with its bill, it is repugnant to this disease which is sudden
and silent.” One portion of the powdered claws of a goose,
minus the skin and flesh, is added for much the same reason,
and the claw of a goose rather than a gander is required
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
because the female bird is the more silent of the two. These
constituents are bound together in a cloth, placed for three
days near a recent molecast,&mdash;for such earth is more wholesome,
then are put near ice to cool and then in the sun to
dry. Cakes are then to be made with this powder and the
livers of some edible animal and bird and a little meal and
cummin seed, and eaten for five days. Against diabolical
phantasms is recommended a belt made of the skin of a
roebuck, which is a pure animal, and of the skin of the
<i>helun</i>, which is a brave beast, and hence both are abhorred
by evil spirits.<a id="FNanchor_430" href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> The two strips of skin are to be fastened
together by four little steel<a id="FNanchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> nails, and as each is clasped
one repeats the formula, “In the most potent strength of
almighty God I adjure you to safeguard me”; only in
the second, third, and fourth instance instead of saying “I
adjure” (<i>adiuro</i>), the words <i>benedico</i>, <i>constituo</i>, and <i>confirmo</i>
are respectively substituted. One should be girded
with this belt night and day, and magic words will not harm
one.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Magic and
astrology
closely
connected.</div>

<p>We have already encountered more than one instance
of observance of the phases of the moon in Hildegard’s
medicinal and magical procedure, and have met in one of
her formulae a hint that Christ employed astrological election
of a favorable conjunction in performing His miracles.
Thus as usual the influence of the stars is difficult to separate
from other occult virtues of natural substances, and
we may complete our survey of Hildegard’s writings by
considering her views concerning the celestial bodies and
divination of the future.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Astrology
and
divination
condemned.</div>

<p>In the passage of the <i>Scivias</i> to which we have already
referred God condemned astrology and divination as well as
magic.<a id="FNanchor_432" href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> <i>Mathematici</i> are called “deadly instructors and
followers of the Gentiles in unbelief,” and man is reproved
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
for believing that the stars allot his years of life and regulate
all human actions, and for cultivating in the place of
his Creator mere creatures such as the stars and heavens,
which cannot console or help him, or confer either prosperity
or happiness. Man should not consult the stars as
to the length of his life, which he can neither know beforehand
nor alter. He should not seek signs of the future
in either stars or fire or birds or any other creature. “The
error of augury” is expressly rebuked. Man should abstain
not only from worshiping or invoking the devil but from
making any inquiries from him, “since if you wish to know
more than you should, you will be deceived by the old
seducer.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Signs in
the stars.</div>

<p>It is true that sometimes by divine permission the stars
are signs to men, for the Son of God Himself says in the
Gospel by Luke that “There shall be signs in the sun and
moon and stars,” and His incarnation was revealed by a
star. But it is a stupid popular error to suppose that other
men each have a star of their own, and, continues God,
speaking through the medium of Hildegard, “That star
brought no aid to My Son other than that it faithfully announced
His incarnation to the people, since all stars and
creatures fear Me and simply fulfill My dictates and have
no signification of anything in any creature.” This last
observation receives further interpretation in a passage of
the <i>Causae et Curae</i><a id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> which explains that the stars sometimes
show many signs, but not of the future or hidden
thoughts of men, but of matters which they have already
revealed by act of will or voice or deed, so that the air
has received an impression of it which the stars can reflect
back to other men if God allows it. But the sun and moon
and planets do not always thus portray the works of men,
but only rarely, and in the case of some great event affecting
the public welfare.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Superiors
and
inferiors;
effect of
stars and
winds on
elements
and
humors.</div>

<p>If the stars do not even signify the fate and future
of man, they are none the less potent forces and, under God,
causes in the world of nature. “God who created all
things,” writes Hildegard in the <i>Liber divinorum operum</i>,<a id="FNanchor_434" href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a>
“so constituted superiors that He also strengthens and
purifies things below through these, and in the human form
introduces also those things allotted for the soul’s salvation.”
This passage has two sides; it affirms the rule of superiors
over inferiors, but it makes special provision for the salvation
of the human soul. And thus it is a good brief summary
of Hildegard’s position. Sun, moon, and stars are
represented as by the will of God cooperating with the winds&mdash;which
play an important part in Hildegard’s cosmology&mdash;in
driving the elements to and fro;<a id="FNanchor_435" href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> and the humors in the
human body now rage fiercely like the leopard, now move
sluggishly like the crab, now proceed in other ways
analogous to the wolf or deer or bear or serpent or lamb or
lion&mdash;animals whose heads, belching forth winds, are seen
in the vision about the rim of the heavenly spheres.<a id="FNanchor_436" href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> They
suggest the influence of the signs of the zodiac, although
there appears to be no exact correspondence to these in
Hildegard’s visionary scheme of the universe as detailed in
the <i>Liber divinorum operum</i>. In the <i>Causae et curae</i>, on
the other hand, she gives a detailed account of how pairs
or triplets of planets accompany the sun through
each of the twelve signs.<a id="FNanchor_437" href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> In other passages<a id="FNanchor_438" href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> she affirms
that the sun and moon serve man by divine order, and
bring him strength or weakness according to the temper of
the air.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Influence
of the
moon on
human
health and
generation.</div>

<p>Hildegard more especially emphasizes the influence of
the moon, in which respect she resembles many an astrologer.
In the <i>Causae et curae</i><a id="FNanchor_439" href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> she states that some days of the
moon are good, others bad; some, useful and others, useless;
some, strong and others, weak. “And since the moon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
has this changeability in itself, therefore the moisture in
man has its vicissitudes and mutability in pain, in labor, in
wisdom, and in prosperity.” Similarly in the <i>Liber
divinorum operum</i><a id="FNanchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> it is noted that human blood and brain
are augmented when the moon is full and diminish as it
wanes, and that these changes affect human health variously.
Sometimes one incurs epilepsy when the moon is in
eclipse.<a id="FNanchor_441" href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> The moon is the mother of all seasons. Hildegard
marvels in the <i>Causae et curae</i><a id="FNanchor_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> that while men have
sense enough not to sow crops in mid-summer or the coldest
part of winter, they persist in begetting offspring at any
time according to their pleasure without regard either to
the proper period of their own lives or to the time
of the moon. The natural consequence of their heedlessness
is the birth of defective children. Hildegard then
adds<a id="FNanchor_443" href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> by way of qualification that the time of the moon
does not dominate the nature of man as if it were his god,
or as if man received any power of nature from it, or as
if it conferred any part of human nature. The moon
simply affects the air, and the air affects man’s blood and
the humors of his body.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Relations
of the four
humors to
human
character
and fate.</div>

<p>Hildegard, however, not only believed that as the humors
were perturbed and the veins boiled, the health of the body
would be affected and perhaps a fever set in,<a id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> but also that
passions, such as wrath and petulance, were thereby aroused
and the mind affected.<a id="FNanchor_445" href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> This is suggested in a general way
in the <i>Liber divinorum operum</i>, but is brought out in more
detail in the <i>Causae et curae</i>, where various types of men
are delineated according to the combinations of humors in
their bodies, and their characters are sketched and even their
fate to some extent predicted therefrom. In one case<a id="FNanchor_446" href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a>
“the man will be a good scholar, but headlong and too
vehement in his studies, so that he scatters his knowledge
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
over too wide a field, as straw is blown by the wind; and
he seeks to have dominion over others. In body he is
healthy except that his legs are weak and he is prone to
gout; but he can live a long while, if it so please God.”
Such a passage hardly sounds consistent with Hildegard’s
statement elsewhere already noted that man cannot know
the length of his life beforehand. In the case of choleric,
sanguine, melancholy, and phlegmatic men<a id="FNanchor_447" href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> Hildegard
states what the relations of each type will be with women
and even to some extent what sort of children they will
have. She also discusses four types of women in very similar
style.<a id="FNanchor_448" href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> These are not exactly astrological predictions,
but they have much the same flavor and seem to leave little
place for freedom of the will.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hildegard’s
varying
position.</div>

<p>In one passage, however, Hildegard comfortingly adds
that nevertheless the Holy Spirit can penetrate the whole
nature of man and overcome his mutable nature as the sun
dispels clouds, and so counteract the moist influence of the
moon. She also states concerning the significations of the
stars concerning man’s future, “These significations are not
produced by the virtue of the planets themselves alone or
stars or clouds, but by the permission and will and decree of
God, according as God wished to demonstrate to men the
works of the same, just as a coin shows the image of its
lord.”<a id="FNanchor_449" href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> In another passage, on the other hand, Hildegard
recognizes, like Aquinas later, that it is only rarely and with
difficulty that the flesh can be restrained from sinning.<a id="FNanchor_450" href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Nativities
for the
days of
the moon.</div>

<p>Finally, the <i>Causae et curae</i> close with predictions for
each day of the moon of the type of male or female who
will be conceived on that day.<a id="FNanchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> Selecting the eighteenth
day by lot as an example of the others, we read that a
male conceived then will be a thief and will be caught in
the act and will be deprived of his landed property so that
he possesses neither fields nor vineyards, but strives to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
take from others what is not his. He will be healthy in
body and live a long life, if left to himself. A woman conceived
on that day will be cunning and deceitful of speech
and will lead upright men to death if she can. She too
will be sound of body and naturally long-lived, but sometimes
insane. Hildegard then seems to feel it advisable
to add, “But such morals, both in men and in women, are
hateful to God.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Man the
microcosm.</div>

<p>The theory of macrocosm and microcosm had a considerable
attraction for Hildegard. At the beginning of the
<i>Causae et curae</i> she exclaims, “O man, look at man! For
man has in himself heavens and earth ... and in him
all things are latent.”<a id="FNanchor_452" href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a> Presently she compares the firmament
to man’s head, sun, moon, and stars to the eyes, air to
hearing, the winds to smelling, dew to taste, and “the sides
of the world” to the arms and sense of touch. The earth is
like the heart, and other creatures in the world are like the
belly.<a id="FNanchor_453" href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> In the <i>Liber divinorum operum</i> she goes into further
detail. Between the divine image in human form
which she sees in her visions and the wheel or sphere of
the universe she notes such relationships as these. The sun
spreads its rays from the brain to the heel, and the moon
directs its rays from the eyebrows to the ankles.<a id="FNanchor_454" href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> Elsewhere
she says, “The eyebrows of man declare the journeyings
of the moon, namely, the one route by which it approaches
the sun in order to restore itself, and the other by
which it recedes after it has been burnt by the sun.”<a id="FNanchor_455" href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> Again,
from the top of the cerebral cavity to “the last extremity of
the forehead” there are seven distinct and equal spaces, by
which are signified the seven planets which are equidistant
from one another in the firmament.<a id="FNanchor_456" href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> An even more surprising
assumption as to astronomical distances is involved
in the comparison<a id="FNanchor_457" href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> that as the three intervals between the
top of the human head and the end of the throat and the
navel and the groin are all equal, so are the spaces intervening
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
between the highest firmament and lowest clouds and
the earth’s surface and center. Corresponding to these
intervals Hildegard notes three ages of man, infancy,
adolescence, and old age. One more passage may be noted,
since it also involves a similar explanation of weeping for
joy to that given by Adelard of Bath. As the heart is
stirred by emotion, whether of joy or of sorrow, humors
are excited in the lungs and breast which rise to the brain
and are emitted through the eyes in the form of tears. And
in like manner, when the moon begins to wax or wane, the
firmament is disturbed by winds which raise fogs from
the sea and other waters.<a id="FNanchor_458" href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Divination
in dreams.</div>

<p>If Hildegard resorts to a magic of her own in order to
counteract the diabolical arts, and if she accepts a certain
amount of astrological doctrine for all her censure of it, it
is not surprising to find her in the <i>Causae et curae</i> saying
a word in favor of natural divination in dreams despite her
rejection of augury and such arts. She believes that, when
God sent sleep to Adam before he had yet sinned, his soul
saw many things in true prophecy, and that the human soul
may still sometimes do the same, although too often it is
clouded by diabolical illusions.<a id="FNanchor_459" href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> But when the body is in a
temperate condition and the marrow warmed in due
measure, and there is no disturbance of vices or contrariety
of morals, then very often a sleeper sees true
dreams.<a id="FNanchor_460" href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> Hildegard’s own visions, as we have seen, came
to her in her waking hours.</p>

Singer (p. 14) is so non-plussed
by this that he actually interprets
<i>mari</i> as the lake of Constance,
and asks, questioning Hildegard’s
authorship of the <i>Subtilitates</i>,
“How could she possibly derive
all rivers, Rhine and Danube,
Meuse and Moselle, Nahe and
Glan, from the same lake, as does
the author of the <i>Liber subtilitatum</i>?”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_370" href="#FNanchor_370" class="label">[370]</a> Both Vitruvius and Pliny
mention the practice, and the latter
calls it an invention of the
emperor Nero. A note, however,
in Bostock and Riley’s translation
of the <i>Natural History</i> states
that Galen ascribed the practice
to Hippocrates and that Aristotle
was undoubtedly acquainted with
it. When Pliny goes on to say,
“Indeed, it is generally admitted
that all water is more wholesome
when it has been boiled,” another
translator’s note adds, “This is
not at all the opinion at the
present day,” that is, 1856. But
apparently the progress of medical
and biological science since
1856 has been in this respect a
retrogression to Pliny’s view.</p>

Somewhat similarly Moses Maimonides,
the Jewish philosopher,
who was born thirty-seven years
after Hildegard, held that evil
was mere privation and that the
personal devil of scripture was
an allegorical representation
thereof. He also denied the existence
of demons, but considered
belief in angels as second only
in importance to a belief in God.

northern France, and describes the teachers and methods of
the humanistic school of Chartres and the schools of logic
at Paris. This valuable picture of educational conditions
in the middle of the twelfth century has already supplied
us with a number of bits of information concerning authors
of whom we have treated. Its importance in the history
of the study of the classics and of scholasticism has long
been recognized, and its content has often been reproduced
in secondary works, so that we need not dwell upon it
specifically here.<a id="FNanchor_462" href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> Moreover, although John spent some
twelve years in his studies in France, he appears from his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
own statements to have passed from the study of logic and
“grammar” to that of theology without devoting much attention
to natural science,<a id="FNanchor_463" href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a> although he received some instruction
in the Quadrivium from Richard Bishop and
Hardewin the Teuton. He was, it is true, according to
his own statement, a pupil of William of Conches for three
years, but he always alludes to William as a grammarian,
not as a writer on natural philosophy and astronomy. This
one-sided description of William’s teaching warns us not
to place too implicit faith in John’s account of the learned
world of his times. Even if reliable as it stands, it is not
in itself a complete or adequate picture. In the <i>Polycraticus</i>,
however, he engages in a rather long discussion of magic,
astrology and other forms of divination which it behooves
us to note.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Chief
events of
his life.</div>

<p>John tells us that he was a mere lad when in 1136 he
first came from England to Gaul to hear the famous Abelard
lecture. Like many medieval students, he was or soon came
to be in a needy condition and eked out a living at one time
by tutoring the sons of nobles. During the time that had
elapsed between his long training in the liberal arts and
theology and his writing of the <i>Metalogicus</i> in 1159, he
had led a busy life in the employ of Theobald, archbishop
of Canterbury, crossing the Alps ten times, journeying twice
all the way from England to Apulia, and frequently
traveling about England and what is now France (John
says, “the Gauls”&mdash;<i>Gallias</i>). In 1159 he addressed the
<i>Polycraticus</i> to Thomas Becket, then absent with Henry II
as his chancellor at the siege of Toulouse. Thomas was just
about John’s age and, before he became chancellor in 1154
at the age of thirty-six, had been like John first a student
and then in the employ of Archbishop Theobald. John
sided with Thomas Becket in the struggle with Henry II,
retired to France, and returned to England with him in
1170. In 1176 he crowned his career by becoming bishop
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
of Chartres where perhaps some years of his early studies
had been spent. His death was in 1180.</p>

<div class="sidenote">General
character
of the
<i>Polycraticus</i>.</div>

<p>In the <i>Metalogicus</i> John tells us that he has scarcely
touched a book of logic since he left the <i>palaestra</i> of the
dialecticians so many years ago, but he returns to the subject
again in that work. In the <i>Polycraticus</i> his literary
tastes and interests are more manifest. He writes a good
Latin style and shows a wide acquaintance with classical
authors and ancient history as well as with patristic literature.
The character and content of the <i>Polycraticus</i> is more
clearly suggested by its sub-title, “Courtiers’ Trifles and
Philosophers’ Footprints” (<i>De nugis curialium et vestigiis
philosophorum</i>). In part it is satirical, although there is
considerable serious discussion of the state and philosophy
and much moralizing for the benefit of contemporary courts
and statesmen. John confesses that the entire work is little
more than a patch-work of other men’s opinions, sometimes
without specific acknowledgment of the authorities. He
professes to believe that Thomas will recognize the sources
of these passages without being told, while other readers
who are more ignorant will be thereby spurred on to wider
reading. These quotations, moreover, are either from ancient
classical or comparatively early Christian writers.
John does not epitomize recent literature and thought, although
he makes application of the thought of the past to
contemporary society and politics, and although he shows
some acquaintance with the works of contemporary writers
such as Bernard Silvester. In the main his attitude is
essentially conservative; he repeats traditional views in an
attractive but somewhat dilettante literary form, with such
rational criticism as a study of the classics might be expected
to produce when qualified by scrupulous adherence
to medieval Christian dogma. This is especially true of
his discussion of the magic arts and astrology.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Magic,
<i>maleficia</i>,
and <i>mathematica</i>.</div>

<p>John begins to discuss magic in the first of the eight
books of the <i>Polycraticus</i> after a few chapters have been
taken up with such other triflings of courtiers as hunting,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
dicing, music, and theatrical shows and spectacles. More
harmful than the illusions of the stage, he declares, are those
of the magic arts and various kinds of disreputable <i>mathematica</i>,
long since forbidden by the holy fathers who knew
that all these <i>artificia</i>, or rather <i>maleficia</i> arose from
a fatal familiarity of men and demons.<a id="FNanchor_464" href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> John thus takes
as practically synonymous the three terms, <i>magica</i>, <i>mathematica</i>
and <i>maleficium</i>. He presently explains that the
word <i>mathesis</i> in one sense denotes learning in general, but
that when it has a long penultima, it signifies the figments
of divination,<a id="FNanchor_465" href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> which belong under magic, whose varieties
are many and diverse. Thus magic is John’s most general
and inclusive term for all occult arts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Use of
Isidore
on magic.</div>

<p>The account of magic in John’s ninth, tenth, eleventh,
and twelfth chapters is largely derived without acknowledgment
from that of Isidore of Seville.<a id="FNanchor_466" href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a> We have already
seen how this became a stock description of the subject
copied with little change by successive writers and embodied
in the decretals of the church. It is rather surprising that a
writer as well versed in the classics as John is generally
supposed to be should not have borrowed his account more
directly from some such ancient Latin writers as Pliny and
Apuleius. John, however, alters the wording and arrangement
and consequently the emphasis considerably. He
makes it seem, for example, that several magic arts, which
really have nothing to do with predicting the future, are
sub-varieties of divination. He also adds some new varieties
to Isidore’s list of practitioners of the magic arts. The
<i>vultivoli</i> try to affect men by making images of them from
wax or clay. <i>Imaginarii</i>, on the other hand, make images
with the intent that demons should enter these images and
instruct them in regard to doubtful matters. Besides interpreters
of dreams (<i>conjectores</i>) and chiromancers John
further mentions <i>specularii</i> who practise divination by
gazing into polished surfaces such as the edges of swords,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
basins, and mirrors. It was this art that Joseph is described
as exercising or pretending to exercise, when he charged
his brothers with having made off with the cup in which he
was wont to practice divination. The thirteenth and closing
chapter of John’s first book is a long list of omens from
Roman history and Latin literature, especially Vergil.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Relation
of
Thomas
Becket to
John’s discussion.</div>

<p>In the second book he resumes the same subject after a
brief and somewhat apologetic preface in which he states
that all things are of use to the wise man. Therefore he
responds with alacrity to Thomas Becket’s request that he
publish his trifles, introducing interpreters of dreams and
astrologers with some other triflers. We shall later meet
with some further explanation of Thomas’ interest in such
matters. It is perhaps significant that John further expresses
his confidence that Thomas will faithfully protect
those in whom he has inspired boldness of utterance,<a id="FNanchor_467" href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> but
it would be too much to assume from it that John fears any
persecution because he discusses such subjects. More likely
he merely shares the common medieval fear of the envious
bite of critics and reviewers, or wishes to remind Thomas
of his need of his patronage. At any rate he closes the
prologue with the request that Thomas will correct any mistake
in either book.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Inconsistent
Christian
attitude
toward
superstition.</div>

<p>In opening his second book John subscribes to the proverb
that he who trusts in dreams and auguries will never be
secure and asks&mdash;like Cicero in his <i>De divinatione</i><a id="FNanchor_468" href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a>&mdash;what
possible connection there can be between sneezes, yawns,
and other such things accepted as signs and the events which
they are supposed to signify. With Isidore and Augustine<a id="FNanchor_469" href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a>&mdash;although
he names neither&mdash;he rejects those empty incantations
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
and superstitious ligatures which the entire
medical art condemns, although some call them <i>physica</i>.<a id="FNanchor_470" href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a>
This seems like an admirable approach to an attitude of
rational criticism, but John after all may be merely repeating
others’ statements like a parrot, and he entirely spoils
its effect by what he goes on to say. He believes that the
cloak of St. Stephen raised the dead, and that such practices
as saying the Lord’s prayer while plucking or administering
medicinal herbs, or wearing or hearing or repeating
the names of the four evangelists,<a id="FNanchor_471" href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a> are not only allowable
but most useful. He adds further that the force of all omens
depends upon the faith of the recipient.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Divine
and natural
signs.</div>

<p>Although opposing faith in omens and augury, John
admits that God provides signs for His creatures, such as
those of the weather which sailors and farmers learn by
experience and the birds are not ignorant of, or the indications
by which doctors can prognosticate the course of diseases.
Unfortunately the demons also are able to show signs
and thus lead men astray. Mention of signs which preceded
the fall of Jerusalem then leads John into a digression
for several chapters concerning the horrors of the siege
itself and Vespasian and Titus, a passage which was very
likely inserted because Henry II and Becket were at that
very time engaged in laying siege to Toulouse.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Miracle
and occult
virtue.</div>

<p>Returning to the subject of signs, John interprets the
verse in Luke, “There shall be signs in sun and moon and
stars” as having reference to unnatural signs, and the obscuration
of the sun during Christ’s passion as not a natural
eclipse.<a id="FNanchor_472" href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> John explains that by nature he means “the
accustomed course of things or the occult causes of events
for which a reason can be given.”<a id="FNanchor_473" href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> If, however, we accept
Plato’s definition of nature as the will of God there
will be no unnatural events. But John would distinguish
between the gradual growth of leaves and fruit on tree or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
vine by means of roots drawing nutriment from earth’s
vitals and sap produced within the trunk, which is indeed
marvelous and has the most occult causes, and the performance
of the same process without any interval of time, which
he regards as a miracle and of a divine height which transcends
our understanding. After drawing this distinction
between divine miracle and wonders wrought by occult
virtues in nature John returns again to the subject of signs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Interpretation
of
dreams.</div>

<p>For some chapters the topic of dreams and their interpretation
absorbs his attention,<a id="FNanchor_474" href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a> and at first he discusses
in an apparently credulous and approving tone “the varied
significations of dreams, which both experience approves
and the authority of our ancestors confirms.”<a id="FNanchor_475" href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a> He explains
that now the dream concerns the dreamer himself, now
someone else, now common interests, sometimes the public
or general welfare; and he quotes Nestor to the effect that
“trust is put in the king’s dream concerning public matters.”<a id="FNanchor_476" href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a>
After referring credulously to the Sibylline verses
predicting Christ’s incarnation, passion, and ascension, John
continues his exposition of the interpretation of dreams.
He explains that the season of year when one dreams, the
place where one dreams, and the personal characteristics of
the dreamer must all be taken into account; that sometimes
interpretations should be by contraries, and again from like
to like. But then he checks himself with the words: “But
while we pursue these traditions of the interpreters, I fear
lest we deservedly seem not so much to trace the art of
interpretation, which is either no art at all or an idle one,
as to dream ourselves.” He adds further, “Whoever fastens
his credulity to the significations of dreams evidently
wanders as far from sincere faith as from the path of
reason.”<a id="FNanchor_477" href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span></p><div class="sidenote">Dreams of
Joseph and
Daniel.</div>

<p>John then attacks the <i>Dream-Book of Daniel</i>, which he
says “circulates impudently among the hands of the curious”
and gives a specific interpretation for each thing
imagined by the dreamer. He denies the truth and authority
of the book and argues at some length that neither Joseph
nor Daniel would have composed such a work, and that
they interpreted dreams by divine inspiration, not by any
occult art learned in Chaldea or Egypt. In the first place,
the method of interpretation set forth in this book is faulty
and crude. The remainder of John’s argument is worth
quoting in part:</p>

<p>“Daniel indeed had the grace to interpret visions and
dreams, which the Lord inspired in him, but it is inconceivable
that a holy man should reduce this vanity to an art, when
he knew that the Mosaic law prohibited any of the faithful
to heed dreams, being aware how Satan’s satellite for the
subversion of men is transformed into an angel of light and
how suggestions are made by bad angels. Joseph, too, won
the rule of Egypt by his ability to predict.... But if this
could have come from any science of human wisdom, I
should think that some one of his ancestors before him would
have merited it, or I should think that the saint, desirous of
serving science and full of pious impulses, would have left
the art as a legacy, if not to the human race at large, which
would nevertheless have been just, at any rate to his brothers
and sons. Besides, Moses, trained in all the wisdom of the
Egyptians, either was ignorant of or spurned this art, since,
detesting the error of impiety, he took pains to exterminate
it from among God’s people. Furthermore, St. Daniel
learned the studies and wisdom of the Chaldeans, which, as a
saint, he would not have done, had he thought it sinful to
be instructed in their lore. And he had companions in his
education whom he rejoiced to have as comrades in divine
law and justice. For at the same time Ananias, Axarias,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
Misael learned whatever a Chaldean would learn.... But
notice that the privilege which man could not confer was
given to Daniel alone, to bring to light the riddles of dreams
and to scatter the obscurities of figures....”</p>

<p>Pointing out that Daniel read the king’s thoughts and
prophesied “the mystery of salvation” in addition to interpreting
the dream, John then concludes sarcastically:
“Are the interpreters of dreams thus wont to examine
thoughts and remove obscurities, to explain what is involved
and illuminate the darkness of figures? If there is any who
enjoys a like portion of grace, let him join Daniel and Joseph
and like them ascribe to God the glory. He whom the spirit
of truth does not illume vainly puts his confidence in the art
of dreams.”<a id="FNanchor_478" href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
witchcraft
delusion.</div>

<p>John concludes that many dreams are the work of
demons.<a id="FNanchor_479" href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> Especially as of this sort he classifies the illusions
of those who think that they have taken part during
the night in witches’ Sabbats. “What they suffer in spirit
they most wretchedly and falsely believe to have occurred
in the body.”<a id="FNanchor_480" href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> And such dreams come mainly to women,
feeble-minded men, and those weak in the Christian faith.
Too much stress must not, however, be laid upon this
apparent opposition to the witchcraft delusion.<a id="FNanchor_481" href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a> John
admits that the demons send dreams, and if he denies their
verity, he merely repeats a hesitation as to the extent and
reality of the power of demons over the body of men and
the world of nature which we have frequently met in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
patristic literature and which is due to a natural reluctance
to admit that their magic is as real as God’s miracles.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Prevalence
of
astrology.</div>

<p>From divination by dreams and demons John passes to
astrology. To start with he admits the attraction which
the art has for men of intellect in his own time. “Would,”
he exclaims, “that the error of the <i>mathematici</i> could be as
readily removed from enlightened minds as the works of
the demons fade before true faith and a sane consciousness
of their illusions. But in it men go astray with the greater
peril in that they seem to base their error upon nature’s
firm foundation and reason’s strength.”<a id="FNanchor_482" href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a> Beginning with
mathematical and astronomical truths based on nature, reason
and experience, they gradually slip into error, submitting
human destiny to the stars and pretending to
knowledge which belongs to God alone.</p>

<div class="sidenote">John’s
attack
upon it.</div>

<p>John ridicules the astrologers for attributing sex to the
stars and stating the exact characteristics and influences of
each planet, when they cannot agree among themselves
whether the stars are composed of the four elements or
some fifth essence, and when they are confounded by a
schoolboy’s question whether the stars are hard or soft.<a id="FNanchor_483" href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a>
He grants that the sun’s heat and the moon’s control of
humors as it waxes and wanes are potent forces, and that
the other heavenly bodies are the causes of many utilities,
and that from their position and signs the weather may be
predicted. But he complains that the astrologers magnify
the influence of the stars at the expense of God’s control of
nature and of human free will. “They ascribe everything
to their constellations.” Some have even reached such a
degree of madness that they believe that “an image can be
formed in accordance with the constellations so that it will
receive the spirit of life at the nod of the stars and will
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
reveal the secrets of hidden truth.”<a id="FNanchor_484" href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> Whether John has
some magic automaton or merely an engraved astrological
image in mind is not entirely clear.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Does
astrology
imply fatal
necessity?</div>

<p>John is aware, however, that many astrologers will deny
that their science detracts in any way from divine prerogative
and power, and will “appear to themselves to excuse
their error quite readily” by asserting with Plotinus that
God foreknew and consequently foredisposed everything
that is to occur, and that the stars are as much under his
control as any part of nature.<a id="FNanchor_485" href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a> But John will have none
of this sort of argument. “These hypotheses of theirs are
indeed plausible but nevertheless venom lies under the honey.
For they impose on things a certain fatal necessity under the
guise of humility and reverence to God, fearing lest his
intent should perchance alter, if the outcome of things were
not made necessary. Furthermore, they encroach upon the
domain of divine majesty, when they lay claim to that science
of foreseeing times and seasons, which by the Son’s
testimony are reserved to the power of the Father, even to
the degree that they were hid from the eyes of those to whom
the Son of God revealed whatever He heard from the
Father.”<a id="FNanchor_486" href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a></p>

<p>John furthermore contends that divine foreknowledge
does not require fatal necessity. For instance, although
God knew that Adam would sin, Adam was under no compulsion
to do so. God knew that by his guilt Adam would
bring death into the world, but no condition of nature impelled
him to this; in the beginning man was immortal. At
this point John wanders off into a joust at the Stoics and
Epicureans, whom he censures as equally in error, since the
one subjected all to chance, the other to necessity. It is
true, John argues, that I know a stone will fall to earth if I
hurl it skywards, but it “does not act under necessity, for
it might fall or not.” But that it does fall, “though not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
necessary, is true.” John presently recognizes that he has
given away his previous argument against astrology and
that the devotee of the stars will say that he does not
care whether his predictions are necessary or not provided
they are true. “‘Nor does it make any difference to me,’ says
the devotee of the stars, ‘whether the affair in question might
be otherwise, provided I am not doubtful that it will be (as
I think.)’”<a id="FNanchor_487" href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">John’s
lame conclusion.</div>

<p>John accordingly resorts to other arguments and to
facetious sarcasm to cover his confusion. Then he recovers
sufficiently to reiterate his belief that God frequently interferes
in the operation of nature by special providences; and
asserts that God has been known to change His mind, while
the astrologers assert that the stars are constant in their
influences. Expressing doubt, however, whether Thomas
Becket will be convinced by his arguments, especially the
one concerning fate and Providence, or whether he will
not laugh up his sleeve at such a clumsy attempt to refute
so formidable a doctrine, John lamely concludes by citing
Augustine and Gregory against the art, and by affirming
that every astrologer whom he has known has come to some
bad end,<a id="FNanchor_488" href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a> in which assertion he probably simply echoes
Tertullian.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Other
varieties
of magic.</div>

<p>Resuming his discussion of the varieties of magic John
briefly dismisses necromancers with the <i>bon mot</i> that those
deserve death who try to acquire knowledge from the dead.<a id="FNanchor_489" href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a>
A number of other terms in Isidore’s list&mdash;<i>auspices</i>, augurs,
<i>salissatores</i>, <i>arioli</i>, <i>pythonici</i>, <i>aruspices</i>&mdash;he says it is needless
to discuss further since these arts are no longer practiced
in his day, or at least not openly. Turning to more
living superstitions of the present, he explains that
chiromancy professes to discern truths which lie hidden in
the wrinkles of the hands, but that since there is no apparent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
reason for this belief it is not necessary to contravert
it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Thomas
Becket’s
consultation
of
diviners.</div>

<p>John wishes to ask Thomas one thing, however, and
that is what triflers of this sort say when they are interrogated
concerning uncertain future matters. He knows
that Becket is familiar with such men because on the occasion
of a recent royal expedition against Brittany he consulted
both an aruspex and a chiromancer. John notes that
a few days afterwards Thomas “lost without warning the
morning-star so to speak of your race,” and warns him
that such men by their vanity deserve to be consulted no
more. This gentle rebuke did not avail, however, to wean
Thomas entirely from his practice of consulting diviners,
which he continued to do even after he became Archbishop
of Canterbury. In a letter written to the future martyr
and saint in 1170 John again chides Thomas for having
delayed certain important letters because he had been “deluded
by soothsayings which were not of the Spirit” and
exhorts him “So let us renounce soothsayings in the
future.”<a id="FNanchor_490" href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Witch of
Endor:
exorcisms.</div>

<p>Despite his previous declaration that he need not discuss
the <i>pythonici</i>, John now proceeds to do so, listing instances
of ambiguous and deceptive Delphic oracles and discussing
at length the well-worn subject of Saul and the
witch of Endor. He concludes the chapter by a warning
against abuse of the practice of exorcism: “For such is the
slyness of evil spirits that what they do of their own accord
and what men do at their suggestion, they with great pains
disguise so that they appear to perform it unwillingly. They
pretend to be coerced and simulate to be drawn out as it were
by the power of exorcisms, and that they may be the less
guarded against they compose exorcisms apparently expressed
in the name of God or in the faith of the Trinity or
in the power of the incarnation or passion; and they transmit
the same to men and obey men who use these, until they
finally involve them with themselves in the crime of sacrilege
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
and penalty of damnation. Sometimes they even transform
themselves into angels of light, they teach only things of
good repute, forbid unlawful things, strive to imitate purity,
make provision for needs, so that, as if good and favoring,
they are received the more familiarly, are heard the more
kindly, are loved the more closely, are the more readily
obeyed. They also put on the guise of venerable persons....”<a id="FNanchor_491" href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Divination
from
polished
surfaces.</div>

<p>“The <i>specularii</i>,” John continues, “flatter themselves
that they immolate no victims, harm no one, often do good
as when they detect thefts, purge the world of sorceries,
and seek only useful or necessary truth.”<a id="FNanchor_492" href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> He insists that
the success of their efforts is none the less due to demon
aid. John tells how as a boy he was handed over for instruction
in the Psalms to a priest who turned out to be a
practitioner of this variety of magic, who after performing
various adjurations and sorceries tried to have John and
another boy look into polished basins or finger-nails smeared
with holy oil or chrism and report what they saw. The
other boy saw some ghostly shapes but John thanks God
that he could see nothing and so was not employed henceforth
in this manner. He adds that he has known many
<i>specularii</i> and that they have all suffered loss of their sight
or some other evil except the aforesaid priest and a deacon,
and that they took refuge in monasteries and later suffered
evils above their fellows in their respective congregations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Natural
science and
medicine.</div>

<p>John closes his second book with a chapter on natural
scientists and medical men, for he seems to apply the term
<i>physici</i> in both senses, although towards the close of the
chapter he also employs the word <i>medici</i>. He begins by
saying that it is permissible to consult concerning the future
anyone who has the spirit of prophecy or who from scientific
training knows by natural signs what will happen in
the bodies of animals, or who “has learned experimentally
the nature of the time impending,” provided only that these
latter men say and do nothing prejudicial to the Christian
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
faith. But sometimes the <i>physici</i> attribute too much to
nature,<a id="FNanchor_493" href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a> and John has heard many of them disputing concerning
the soul and its virtues and operations, the increase
and diminution of the body, the resurrection, and the creation,
in a way far from accord with the Christian faith.
“Of God Himself too they sometimes so speak, ‘As if
earth-born giants assailed the stars.’”<a id="FNanchor_494" href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a> John recognizes,
however, their knowledge of animals and medicine, although
he finds their theories sometimes in conflict. As for
practicing physicians, he dares not speak ill of them, for
he too often falls into their hands, and he grants that no
one is more necessary or useful than a good doctor. John
makes considerable use of the <i>Natural History</i> of Pliny
and of Solinus, and sometimes for occult or marvelous
phenomena, as when he cites Pliny concerning men who
have the power of fascination by voice and tongue or by
their glances, and adds the testimony of the Physiognomists.<a id="FNanchor_495" href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Summary.</div>

<p>It may be well to review and further emphasize some
of the chief features of John’s rather rambling discussion.
Despite its frequent quotations from classic poets and
moralists, it is theological in tone and content to a degree
perhaps greater than I have succeeded in suggesting, for to
repeat all its scriptural passages would be tedious. There
is even some theological jealousy and suspicion of natural
science shown. John perhaps more nearly duplicates the
attitude of Augustine than that of any other writer. Magic
is represented as inevitably associated with, and the work
of, demons. John sometimes charges the magic arts with
being irrational or injurious, but these charges are in a way
but corollaries of his main thesis. The arts must be harmful
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
since demons are concerned with them, while the influence
of demons seems the only rational explanation for their existence.
John repeats the old Isidorian definition of magic
but he adds some current superstitions and shows that the
magic arts are far from having fallen into disuse. Finally
he shows us how vain must have been all the ecclesiastical
thunders and warnings of demons and damnation, like his
own, directed against magic, from the fact that not merely
kings of the past like Saul and Pharaoh, but clergy of the
present themselves&mdash;a priest and a deacon, a chancellor
and an archbishop of England&mdash;practice or patronize such
arts. Sometimes John’s own condemnation of them seems
a bit perfunctory; he takes more relish, it seems at times,
in describing them. Again, as in the case of astrology, he
evidently feels that his opposition will be of little avail.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Daniel’s
education.</div>

<p>In discussing Gerard of Cremona in a previous chapter we
noticed the studies at Toledo of Daniel <i>de Merlai</i> or of
Morley, how he heard Gerard translate the <i>Almagest</i> into
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
Latin and defend the fatal influence of the stars, and Galippus,
the Mozarab, teach concerning the universe in
“the tongue of Toledo,”&mdash;presumably Spanish. Like Adelard
of Bath, Daniel had long absented himself from England
in the pursuit of learning, and had first spent some
time at Paris, apparently engaged in the study of Roman
law. He became disgusted, however, with the instruction
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
there and in his preface<a id="FNanchor_496" href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> speaks sarcastically of “the brutes”
(<i>bestiales</i>) who occupied professorial chairs “with grave authority”
and read from codices too heavy to carry (<i>importabiles</i>)
which reproduced in golden letters the traditions of
Ulpian. Holding lead pencils in their hands, they marked
these volumes reverently with obeli and asterisks. They
wished to conceal their ignorance by maintaining a dignified
and statuesque silence, “but when they tried to say
something, I found them most childish.” Daniel accordingly
made haste away to Spain to acquire the learning of the
Arabs and to hear “wiser philosophers of the universe.”
Finally, however, his friends summoned him back to England
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
and he returned “with an abundant supply of precious
volumes.” On his arrival he found that the interest in Roman
law had almost completely eclipsed that in Greek philosophy,
and that Aristotle and Plato were assigned to oblivion.
Not wishing to remain the sole Greek among Romans,
he prepared to withdraw again where the studies in
which he was interested flourished. But on the way he met
John, bishop of Norwich (1175-1200) who asked him many
questions concerning his studies at Toledo and the marvels
of that city, and concerning astronomy and the rule of the
superior bodies over this sublunar world. Daniel’s present
treatise gives a fuller reply to these inquiries than time then
permitted him to make.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the following bibliographical
note the MSS will be listed first
and then the printed works by or
concerning Daniel of Morley.</p>

<p>Arundel 377, 13th century, well-written
small quarto, fols. 88-103,
“Philosophia magistri danielis de
merlai ad iohannem Norwicensem
episcopum ... / ...  Explicit
liber de naturis inferiorum et superiorum.”
Until very recently
this was supposed to be the only
MS of Daniel’s sole extant work.
No other treatise has as yet been
identified as his, but several other
MSS may be noted of the whole
or parts of the aforesaid “Philosophia”
or “Liber de naturis inferiorum
et superiorum.”</p>

<p>Corpus Christi 95, 13th century,
where, according to K. Sudhoff
in the publication noted below,
the first two or three books
ascribed to William of Conches
are really the work of Daniel of
Morley.</p>

<p>Berlin Latin Quarto 387, 12th
century, 51 fols. Attention was
called to it by Birkenmajer in the
publication noted below. It has
many slips of copyists and is regarded
by him as neither the
original nor a direct copy thereof.
For the MS to be written in
the twelfth century this would
require a very rapid multiplication
and dissemination of Daniel’s
treatise which was at the earliest
not composed until after 1175.</p>

<p>The remaining MSS have not
hitherto been noted by writers on
Daniel:</p>

<p>CUL 1935 (Kk. I. 1), 13th century,
small folio, fols. 98r-105r
(and not to 115r, as stated in the
MSS catalogue, which gives
Daniel Morley as the author, but
<i>De creatione mundi</i> as the title).
From rotographs of fols. 98r-v,
100r, and 105r, I judge that this
copy is almost identical with
Arundel 377 but somewhat less
legible and accurate.</p>

<p>Oriel 7, 14th century folio, fols.
194v-196v (191-193, according to
Coxe), extracts from <i>De philosophia
Danielis</i>, opening, “Nos qui
mistice.”... They are immediately
preceded by extracts from
“Adelardi Bathoniensis ... de
decisionibus naturalibus.”</p>

<p>Corpus Christi 263, early 17thI’ll sp
century, fols. 166v-67r, “Ex Daniele
de Merlai” (or, “Merlac,” according
to Coxe) “alias Morley
in lib. de superioribus et inferioribus
primo De creationis Mundi.”
This MS is one of the notebooks
of Brian Twyne, the Elizabethan
antiquary, written in his own
hand.</p>

<p>Twyne perhaps made his extracts
from Arundel 377, for immediately
after them he gives extracts
“from William of Conches
who is together with Daniel Merlai
in our library,” and in Arundel
377 Daniel’s work is immediately
followed by that of William
of Conches. Moreover, of the
Selden MSS which are now in
the Bodleian, Supra 72 was once
owned by Lord “William Howarde”
who died in 1640, while
Supra 77 is marked “Arundel,”
referring presumably to Thomas
Howard, Earl of Arundel, who
died in 1646, and Supra 79 consists
of astronomical and astrological
treatises copied by Brian
Twyne. If MSS which once belonged
to the Arundel collection
and to Twyne have thus passed
somehow into the Selden collection
and are found listed there
in close proximity to one another,
it is at least tempting to conjecture
that the MS containing Daniel’s
treatise, followed by that
of William of Conches, which
Twyne says was once “in our library,”
somehow became Arundel
377.</p>

<p>BN 6415 does not contain <i>De
philosophia Danielis</i>, as stated by
C. Jourdain (1838) p. 101; Jourdain,
however, regarded Adelard
of Bath as the author of <i>De
philosophia Danielis</i>, and BN
6415 does contain Adelard’s <i>Questiones
naturales</i>.</p>

<p>Balliol 96, 15th century, a commentary
upon Aristotle’s eight
books of Physics in the form of
questions and preceded by a prologue,
“Expliciunt questiones super
8 libros phisicorum compilate
a domino Marlo magistro in artibus
Tholose ac canonico de Timsey.”
This does not seem to be
a work by Daniel of Morley; a
cursory examination revealed no
reason for thinking that <i>domino
Marlo</i> should read <i>Daniele Merlai</i>,
or that <i>Tholose</i> should be
<i>Tholeto</i>.</p>

<p>I have not examined two MSS
at Queen’s College, Oxford, Reg.
lxxi; lxxiv, 4) containing pedigrees
of the Morlay or Morley
family which may possibly throw
some light upon Daniel’s identity.</p>

<p>All the printing that has been
done of Daniel’s treatise has
been based upon Arundel 377. J.
O. Halliwell, <i>Rara Mathematica</i>,
1839, and Thomas Wright, <i>Biographia
Literaria</i>, London, 1846,
II, 227-30, printed the preface and
other brief extracts for the first
time.</p>

<p>Valentin Rose reprinted the
preface and also published the
conclusion in his article, “Ptolemaeus
und die Schule von Toledo,”
<i>Hermes</i> VIII (1874) 327-49.
Rose also gave a list of the
authorities cited by Daniel which
makes a very large number of
omissions: for example, fol. 89r,
“sicut in trismegisto repperitur”
and “isidori”; fol. 90v, Aristotle,
“philosophus,” “Adultimus” (?),
“Platonitus”; fol. 91r, “Esiodus
autem naturalis scientie professor
omnia dixit esse ex terra,” and
so on for “tales milesius,” Democritus,
and other Greek philosophers;
fol. 91v, “sicut ab inexpugnabili
sententia magni hermetis”;
fol. 92r, “audiat ysidori
in libro differentiarum”; fol. 92v,
“unde astrologus ille poeta de
creatione mundi ait,” and “magnus
mercurius” and “trismegistus
mercurius” and “trismegistus
mercurius praedicti mercurii nepos”;
fol. 97r, “Aristotelis in libro
de sensu et sensato,” “Albumaxar,”
“Aristotelis in libro de
auditu naturali”; fol. 98v, “in libro
de celi et mundo”; fol. 99v,
Almagest, and “Ypocrati et galieno”;
fol. 100v, “liber veneris
... quem edidit thoz grecus,”
and “aristoteles ... in libro de
speculo adurenti.”</p>

<p>Karl Sudhoff, <i>Daniels von
Morley Liber de naturis inferiorum
et superiorum nach der Handschrift
Cod. Arundel 377 des
Britischen Museums zum Abdruck
gebracht</i>, in <i>Archiv für die
Geschichte der Naturwissenschaften
und der Technik</i>, Band 8, 1917
(but not received at the New
York Public Library until July 8,
1921). Here is printed for the
first time the full text of Daniel’s
treatise as contained in Arundel
377, but from photographs taken
years before and apparently without
further reference to the MS
itself. Also according to the following
article by Birkenmajer,
Sudhoff sometimes renders the
contractions and abbreviations incorrectly.
As Sudhoff’s text
comes late to my hand, I leave
my references to the folios of
Arundel 377 as they are. These
folios (with the exception of
88v) are marked in Sudhoff’s
text.</p>

<p>Alexander Birkenmajer, <i>Eine
neue Handschrift des Liber de
naturis inferiorum et superiorum
des Daniel von Merlai</i>, in the
same <i>Archiv</i>, December, 1920, pp.
45-51, gives some variant readings
from Berlin 387.</p>

<p>Dr. Charles Singer has published
a brief account of Daniel
of Morley in a recent issue of
<i>Isis</i>.</p>

<p>The article on Daniel in DNB
XXXIX (1894) by A. F. Pollard
is criticized by Sudhoff for failing
to mention “Roses wichtigste
Vorarbeit;” but I observe that
Sudhoff himself similarly fails to
mention the publications by

which preceded both Rose’s and
his own.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Defense
of Arabian
learning.</div>

<p>Daniel warns his readers at the start not to scorn the
simple language and lucid style in which the doctrines of
the Arabs are set forth, or to mistake the laborious circumlocutions
and ambiguous obscurities of contemporary Latins
for signs of profound learning. Nor should anyone be
alarmed because he presents the opinions of Gentile philosophers
instead of church fathers in treating of the creation
of the world. They may not have been Christians, but
where their opinions seem sound, Daniel believes in taking
spoils of learning even from pagans and infidels, as God
instructed the Hebrews to do in the case of the golden and
silver vessels of the Egyptians. Thus he borrows the theory
of a triple universe from an Arabic work. The first universe
exists only in the divine mind and is neither visible
nor corporeal, but is eternal. The second universe is in
work and is visible, corporeal, and in that state not eternal.
It was created simultaneously with time. The third universe
is imitative. It is the microcosm and was formed in time
and is visible and corporeal, but is in part eternal.<a id="FNanchor_497" href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a> In a
later passage<a id="FNanchor_498" href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a> Daniel again defends his use of Arabian authorities,
contending that it is only just that one who is already
informed concerning the opinions about things supercelestial
of the philosophers in use among the Latins should
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
also not disdain to listen attentively to the views of the Arabs
which cannot be impugned. It may be perilous to imitate
them in some respects, but one should be informed even on
such points in order to be able to refute and avoid the errors
to which they lead.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A moderate
treatment
of

points
between
science
and religion.</div>

<p>In general plan, tone, and content, as well as in the
title, <i>Philosophia</i>, Daniel’s treatise roughly resembles that
of William of Conches. As Daniel says in his preface, the
first part deals with the inferior portion of the universe, and
the second part with the superior part. The work proper
opens with a discussion of the creation, in which Daniel expresses
some rather original ideas, although he treats of such
time-worn topics as God’s creation of the angels, of the
universe, and of man in His own image, and then of man’s
fall through concupiscence, virtue and vice, and like matters.
Later he argues against those who hold that the world
is eternal, but he is not quite ready to accept the Mosaic account
of creation entire. He argues that in the beginning
God created heaven and earth and cites Augustine, Isidore,
and Bede to show that the meaning is that heaven and earth
were created simultaneously. He then adds that philosophers
are loath to accept the division of the works of creation
over six days; in human works it is true that one thing
must be done before another, but God could dispense everything
with “one eternal word.”<a id="FNanchor_499" href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The four
elements
and fifth
essence.</div>

<p>The four elements are discussed a good deal and it is
explained that fire is hot and dry, air is hot and wet, and so
on.<a id="FNanchor_500" href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a> To fire correspond cholera, the light of the eyes, and
curiosity; to air, blood, words, and loquacity; to water,
phlegm, abundance of natural humors, and lust; to earth,
melancholy, corpulence, and cruelty.<a id="FNanchor_501" href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a> Daniel, like Adelard
of Bath and William of Conches, repeats the doctrine that
the four elements are not found in a pure state in any bodies
perceptible to our sense, that no one has ever touched earth
or water, or seen pure air or fire, and that the four elements
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
are perceptible only to the intellect. Daniel differs from
Adelard and William, however, in denying that the stars
are made merely out of the purer parts of the four elements.
He declares that the Arabs will not agree to this, but that
the higher authorities in astrology assert that the stars are
composed of a fifth essence.<a id="FNanchor_502" href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a> Daniel furthermore speaks of
three bonds existing between the four elements, stating that
scientists call the relation between fire and air, obedience;
that between air and water, harmony; and that between
water and earth, necessity.<a id="FNanchor_503" href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> This faintly reminds one of the
three relationships between the four principles of things
which were associated with the names of the three fates in
the essay on fate ascribed to Plutarch.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Superiors
and
inferiors.</div>

<p>But the greatest bond in nature is that existing between
the superior and inferior worlds. An oft-repeated and fundamental
principle of Daniel’s philosophy, and one which
explains the division of his work into two parts, is the doctrine
that superiors conquer inferiors, that the world of the
sky controls the world of the four elements, and that the
science of the stars is superior to all other disciplines.<a id="FNanchor_504" href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a> “The
sages of this world have divided the world into two parts,
of which the superior one which extends from the circle of
the moon even to the immovable heaven is the agent. The
other, from the lunar globe downwards, is the patient.”<a id="FNanchor_505" href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a>
Much depends, however, not only upon the force emitted by
the agent but upon the readiness of the patient to receive
the celestial influence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Daniel’s
astronomy.</div>

<p>Daniel of course believed in a spherical earth and a geocentric
universe. Influenced probably by the <i>Almagest</i>, he
explains the eccentrics of the five planets in a way which he
regards as superior to what he calls the errors of Martianus
Capella and almost all Latins, and to the obscure traditions
which the Arabs have handed down but scarcely understood
themselves.<a id="FNanchor_506" href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a> He affirms that there are not ten heavens or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
spheres, as some have said, but only eight, as Alphraganus
truly teaches.<a id="FNanchor_507" href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Astrological
argument.</div>

<p>There are some men who deny any efficacy to the motions
of the stars, but Daniel charges that they for the most
part condemn the science without knowing anything about
it, “and hold astronomy in hatred from its name alone.”<a id="FNanchor_508" href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a>
He replies that it is useful to foreknow the future and defends
astrology in much the usual manner. He details the
qualities of the seven planets<a id="FNanchor_509" href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a> whom the Arabs call “lords
of nativities.”<a id="FNanchor_510" href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a> Also he takes up the properties and attributes
of the signs of the zodiac and how the Arabs divide
the parts of the human body among them.<a id="FNanchor_511" href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Astrology
and other
sciences.</div>

<p>Daniel interprets the scope of astrology very broadly,
asserting that it has eight parts: the science of judgments,
or what we should call judicial astrology; medicine; nigromancy
according to physics; agriculture; illusions or magic
(<i>de praestigiis</i>); alchemy, “which is the science of the transmutation
of metals into other species; the science of images,
which Thoz Grecus set forth in the great and universal book
of Venus; and the science of mirrors, which is of broader
scope and aim than the rest, as Aristotle shows in the treatise
on the burning glass.”<a id="FNanchor_512" href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a> Except that magic illusions have
replaced navigation, this list of eight branches of learning
is the same as that which Gundissalinus repeated from Al-Farabi,
but which they called branches of natural science
rather than of astrology. At any rate we see again the close
association of natural science and useful arts with astrology
and magic, and necromancy and alchemy, and with pseudo-writings
of Aristotle and Hermes Trismegistus. In other
passages Daniel cites genuine Aristotelian treatises<a id="FNanchor_513" href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a> and
speaks of “the great Mercury” and of the other “Mercury
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
Trismegistus, the nephew of the aforesaid.”<a id="FNanchor_514" href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> Despite his
subordination of alchemy to astrology in the above passage,
Daniel does not seem to have it in mind when he remarks
that there are “some who assign diverse colors of metals
to the planets,” as lead to Saturn, silver to Jupiter, white to
Venus, and black to Mercury.<a id="FNanchor_515" href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a> He goes on to deny that
the stars are really colored any more than the sky is.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Daniel and
Greek: a
misinterpretation.</div>

<p>Some modern scholars have drawn inferences from Daniel’s
treatise with which I am unable to agree. Mr. S. A.
Hirsch in his edition of Roger Bacon’s Greek Grammar
follows Cardinal Gasquet<a id="FNanchor_516" href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a> in observing concerning Daniel’s
preface, “There can be no clearer testimony than this to the
complete oblivion into which Greek had in those days fallen
in western Europe, including England.” It may be granted
that there was and had been little knowledge of Greek
grammar and the Greek language in twelfth century England,
but that is not what Daniel is talking about: indeed,
there seems to be no reason for believing Daniel himself
proficient in either Greek grammar or Greek literature, although
he was shrewd enough to question whether Chalcidius
always interpreted Plato aright.<a id="FNanchor_517" href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> When he calls himself
“the only Greek among Romans,” he means the only
one interested in Greek philosophy and astronomy and in
translations of the same made largely from the Arabic. But
earlier in the same century we have seen Adelard of Bath,
William of Conches, and Bernard Silvester interested either
in Platonism or Arabic science, and the anonymous Sicilian
translator of the Almagest from the Greek, and before him
Burgundio of Pisa and other translators from the Greek.
Therefore all that Daniel’s remarks seems to indicate is that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
there was less interest in Greek philosophy in England after
his return than before he went away, owing to the temporary
popularity of the study of Roman law. But he knew
where the studies in which he was interested still flourished.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Daniel
and the
church: a
misinterpretation.</div>

<p>A more serious misinterpretation of Daniel’s relation to
his age is Valentin Rose’s assertion that, because of Daniel’s
addiction to Arabian and astrological doctrines, “his book
found no favor in the eyes of the church and was shunned
like poison. It has left no traces in subsequent literature;
no one has read it and no one cites it.”<a id="FNanchor_518" href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> Rose spoke on the
assumption that only one copy of Daniel’s treatise had
reached us, whereas now we know of several manuscripts of
it. If it did not become so widely known as some works,
the more probable reason for this may well be that his brief
résumé of Arabic and astrological doctrines appeared too
late, when the fuller works of Ptolemy and of the Arabic
astrologers were already becoming known through complete
Latin translations. Brief pioneer treatises, like those of
Adelard of Bath and William of Conches, which had appeared
earlier in the century, had had time to become widely
known during a period when there was perhaps nothing fuller
and better available. But Daniel’s little trickle of learning
from Toledo, which does not represent any very considerable
advance over Adelard and William, might well be
engulfed in the great stream of translations that now poured
from Spain into Christian western Europe.<a id="FNanchor_519" href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a> It is unreasonable
to conjecture that Daniel’s book, which is rather
mild anyway in its astrological doctrine, and which was
called forth by the favoring questions of a bishop, was then
crushed by bitter ecclesiastical opposition; when we know
that William’s book, which actually encountered an ecclesiastical
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
opposition of which we have no evidence in Daniel’s
case, nevertheless continued in circulation and was much
cited in the next century; and when we know that both
Arabic and astrological doctrines and books were widespread
in Christian western Europe both in the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries. Treatises with more poison of astrology
in them than his were read and cited and seem to have
weathered successfully, if not to have escaped unscathed,
whatever ecclesiastical censure may have been directed
against them. If Daniel’s own composition did not secure
a wide circle of readers, the chances are that “the multitude
of precious volumes” which he imported from Spain to
England did. And if the work of the pupil remained little
cited, the translations of the master, Gerard of Cremona,
who had taught him astrology at Toledo, became known
throughout western Europe. Thus, while Daniel’s personal
influence may not have been vast, he reflects for us the progress
of a great movement of which he was but a part.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Daniel’s
future
influence.</div>

<p>But Rose was further mistaken in his assertion that
Daniel’s <i>De philosophia</i> “has left no trace in subsequent literature;
no one has read it and no one cites it.” Not only is
the work found complete in three manuscripts of which
Rose did not know, and of which one appears to be twice
removed from the original. In a manuscript of the fourteenth
century at Oriel College, Oxford,<a id="FNanchor_520" href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a> in the fitting company
of excerpts from Adelard of Bath and Gundissalinus,
are over three double column folio pages of extracts drawn
from various portions of the <i>Philosophia</i>. These begin with
Daniel’s excuse for borrowing the eloquence and wisdom of
the infidels and with some of his utterances anent the creation
of the world. They include a number of his citations
of other writers, his story of the two fountains outside the
walls of Toledo which varied in fulness with the moon’s
phases and contained salt water although remote six days
journey from the sea, and other bits of his astrological doctrine.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
A similar, although not identical, selection of pearls
from Daniel’s philosophy is found in one of the notebooks
of Brian Twyne,<a id="FNanchor_521" href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a> the Elizabethan antiquary, who gives the
title of Daniel’s work as <i>De superioribus et inferioribus</i> and
makes extracts both from its first and second books. Both
Twyne and the Oriel manuscript’s writer seem to have been
particularly impressed with Daniel’s views concerning the
creation, rather than his retailing of astrological doctrine.
Twyne first repeats his statement that the quantity of the
universe reveals the power of its Maker; its quality, His
wisdom; and its marvelous beauty, His unbounded good will.
Twyne also notes Daniel’s phrase, “court of the world,” for
the universe. Both Twyne and the Oriel manuscript note
the passage concerning the triple universe, and another in
which Daniel tells how the three human qualities, reason,
irascibility, and desire, may be either used to discern and
resist evil, or perverted to evil courses. Both also notice his
contention that the chaos preceding creation was not <i>hyle</i>
or matter but a certain contrariety present in matter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Roger of
Hereford.</div>

<p>In the same manuscript with Daniel’s treatise is a work
by another Englishman, Roger of Hereford,<a id="FNanchor_522" href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a> who was contemporary
with him, who wrote treatises both in astronomy
and astrology, and who, again like Daniel, was encouraged
by a bishop. We are not, I believe, directly informed whether
any of his works were translations from the Arabic or
whether he was ever in Spain, but some of them sound as if
they might be at least adaptations from the Arabic. At any
rate Alfred of England dedicated to Roger the translation
which he made from the Arabic of the pseudo-Aristotelian
<i>De vegetabilibus</i>. Astronomical tables which Roger calculated
for the meridian of Hereford in 1178 are based upon
tables for Marseilles and Toledo, and the manuscript of one
of his works is said by the copyist of 1476 to have been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
taken by him from an ancient codex written in Toledo in
the year 1247.<a id="FNanchor_523" href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a> Other astronomical treatises attributed to
Roger are a <i>Theory of the Planets, a Treatise concerning
the rising and setting of the Signs</i>, and a <i>Compotus</i> which
dates itself in 1176 and is addressed to a Gilbert<a id="FNanchor_524" href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a> who
seems to be no other than Foliot, bishop of Hereford until
1163 and thereafter bishop of London. The signature of
Roger of Hereford attests one of his documents in 1173-1174.
In 1176 in the preface to the <i>Compotus</i><a id="FNanchor_525" href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> Roger
speaks of himself as <i>iuvenis</i>, and the heading in the manuscript
even calls him “Child Roger” or “Roger Child,”<a id="FNanchor_526" href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a>
but he also says that he has devoted many years to learning,
so that we need not regard him as especially youthful at that
time. The definite dates in his career seem to fall in the
decade from 1170 to 1180, although his association with
Alfred of England may well have been later.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An astrology
in four
parts.</div>

<p>Professor Haskins ascribes one or more astrological
works to Roger of Hereford and lists a number of manuscripts
with three different <i>Incipits</i>.<a id="FNanchor_527" href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a> Some of these manuscripts
I have examined. One at Paris has the <i>Titulus</i>, “In
the name of God the pious and merciful, here opens the
book of the division of astronomy and its four parts composed
by the famous astrologer Roger of Hereford.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span><a id="FNanchor_528" href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a>
Roger explains that the first part is general and concerned
with such matters as “peoples, events, and states, changes of
weather, famine, and mortality.” The second is special and
deals with the fate of the individual from birth to life’s close.
The third deals with interrogations and the fourth with
elections. The first chapter of the first part is entitled, “Of
the properties of the signs and planets in any country,” and
opens with the statement that it has been proved by experience
that the signs Aries and Jupiter have dominion in the
land “baldac and babel and herach,” Libra and Saturn in
the land of the Christians, Scorpion and Venus in the land
of the Arabs, Capricorn and Mercury in India, Leo and
Mars over the Turks, Aquarius and the Sun in Babylonia,
Virgo and the Moon in Spain. The other five signs seem
to be left without a country.<a id="FNanchor_529" href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a> Chapter two tells how to find
what sign dominates in any villa; three, of the powers of
the planets in universal events; four, of the science of the
annual significance of the planets; five, knowledge of rains
for the four seasons; six, knowledge of winds in any villa;<a id="FNanchor_530" href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a>
nine, the twenty-eight mansions of the moon. After the
tenth chapter distinguishing these mansions as dry and wet
and temperate, the second part on nativities opens with the
retrospective statement, “Now we have treated of the first
part of this art, omitting what many astrologers have said
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
without experience and without reason.”<a id="FNanchor_531" href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a> After a dozen
chapters on the significance of the twelve houses in nativities,
the author again asserts that in his discussion of
that subject he has said nothing except what learned men
agree upon and experience has tested.<a id="FNanchor_532" href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a> After devoting three
chapters to the familiar astrological theme of the revolution
of years, he takes up in the third and fourth books<a id="FNanchor_533" href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a> interrogations
according to the twelve houses and elections, which
are made in two ways according as the nativity is or is not
known. The invocation of God the pious and compassionate
in the <i>Titulus</i> and the list of countries and peoples in the
first chapter have a Mohammedan and oriental flavor and
suggest that the work is a translation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Another
astrology
in four
parts.</div>

<p>Different from the foregoing is another work dealing
with four parts of judicial astrology which the manuscripts
ascribe to Roger of Hereford. Its opening words<a id="FNanchor_534" href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a> and the
subjects of its four parts all differ from those of the other
treatise. Its first part deals with “simple judgment”; its
fourth part, with “the reason of judgment”; while its second
and third parts instead of third and fourth, as in the
foregoing treatise, deal with interrogations, now called
<i>Cogitatio</i>, and elections.<a id="FNanchor_535" href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> I know of no manuscript where
this second work is to be found complete; in fact, I am inclined
to surmise that usually the manuscripts give only the
first of its four parts.<a id="FNanchor_536" href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a> It professes at the start to be a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
brief collection of rules of judicial astrology hitherto only
to be found scattered through various works. Astrology is
extolled as an art of incomparable excellence without which
other branches of learning are fruitless. “They appear to
a few through experiments; ... it gives most certain experiments.”<a id="FNanchor_537" href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a>
The first book treats of the properties of the
signs and planets, of the twelve houses, and defines a long
list of astrological terms such as <i>respectus</i>, <i>applicatio</i>, <i>separatio</i>,
<i>periclitus</i>, <i>solitudo</i>, <i>allevatio</i>, <i>translatio</i>, <i>collatio</i>, <i>redditio</i>,
<i>contradictio</i>, <i>impeditio</i>, <i>evasio</i>, <i>interruptio</i>, <i>compassio</i>,
<i>renuntiatio</i>, and <i>receptio</i>.<a id="FNanchor_538" href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> Some tables are also given, in
connection with one of which we are told that the longest
hour at Hereford exceeds the shortest by eleven degrees and
forty minutes.<a id="FNanchor_539" href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Book of
Three
General
Judgments.</i></div>

<p>To Roger is also ascribed a <i>Book of Three General
Judgments of Astronomy, from which all others flow</i>, which
sometimes is listed separately in the manuscripts and apparently
is found alone as a distinct work,<a id="FNanchor_540" href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a> but in other manuscripts<a id="FNanchor_541" href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a>
seems to be an integral part of the work of four
parts which we have just described. Its three general judgments
are: gaining honors and escaping evils; <i>intentio vel
meditacio</i>, which, like the <i>cogitacio</i> mentioned above, refers
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
to interrogations; and <i>comparatio vel electio</i> which of course
is elections. Thus the second and third parts of this <i>Book
of Three General Judgments</i> deal with the same subjects
as the second and third books of the work in four parts,
which makes it difficult to distinguish them. I am inclined
to think that in those manuscripts where the <i>Book of Three
General Judgments</i> seems an integral part of the work in
four parts, we really have simply the first of the four parts,
followed by the <i>Book of Three General Judgments</i>.<a id="FNanchor_542" href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a> At any
rate it seems clear that most of Roger’s astrological composition
is on the theme of interrogations and elections. <i>Iudicia
Herefordensis</i>,<a id="FNanchor_543" href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a> found in more than one manuscript, may
come from a fourth work of his or be portions of the foregoing
works.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Summary.</div>

<p>In this chapter we have treated of two Englishmen of
the latter half of the twelfth century who are not generally
known.<a id="FNanchor_544" href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a> They were not, however, without influence, as we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
have already shown in the case of Daniel of Morley and as
the number of manuscripts of the works of Roger of Hereford
sufficiently attests for him. Daniel and Roger show
that the same interest in astrology and astronomy from Arabic
sources prevails at the close of the century in England
as at its beginning in the cases of Walcher, prior of Malvern,
and Adelard of Bath. Daniel, like Adelard, illustrates the
relation of science to Christian thought; Roger, like Walcher,
is an astronomer who makes and carefully records observations
of his own,<a id="FNanchor_545" href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a> while he trusts in astrology as based
upon experience. As Alfred of England dedicated his translation
of the pseudo-Aristotelian <i>De vegetabilibus</i> to Roger,
so he dedicated his <i>De motu cordis</i> (<i>On the Motion of the
Heart</i>) to a third Englishman, Alexander Neckam, to whom
we turn in the next chapter for a picture of the state of science
and his work <i>On the Natures of Things</i> (<i>De naturis rerum</i>)
in his time.</p>

I have not been able to
compare edition and manuscript

the original, whether it be by

<p>Dijon 1045 (the same, I judge,

Magistro Rogero de Herfordia.
Quoniam circa tria sit (fit?) omnis
astronomica consideratio ... / ...

last is not the same ending as in
Dijon 1045, but would seem to
refer to the length of the shortest
day.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_541" href="#FNanchor_541" class="label">[541]</a> Selden supra 76 and MS E
Musaeo 181.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_542" href="#FNanchor_542" class="label">[542]</a> As we have already seen to be
the case in CUL 1693, fols. 40-51-59.
In Selden supra 76, the work
in four parts begins at fol. 3r,
“Liber magistri Rogeri Hereford
de iudiciis astronomicis. Quoniam
regulas artis....” At fol. 10v,
Liber de tribus generalibus iudiciis
astronomie ex quibus cetera
omnia defluunt, editus a magistro
Rogero Hereford. In three
books and a prologue, opening,
“Quoniam circa tria fit omnis
astronomica consideracio....”
The question then arises, do fol.
14v, “Incipit liber secundus de
cogitatione. Sed quum iam de
intentione et cogitatione tractandum...”;
and fol. 18r, “Incipit
liber tercius de electione vel
operatione per quod fiat electio”;
have reference to the last two
books of <i>Three General Judgments</i>
or to the two middle books
of the work in four parts? Apparently
the former, since there is
no fourth part given; at fol. 20
seems to open another treatise,
<i>Liber de motibus planetarum</i>.</p>

<p>MS E Musaeo 181 has the same
arrangement as Selden supra 76,
fols. 10-18, but ends with the second
book <i>De cogitacione</i>. For
the first of the four parts it is
fuller than Selden supra 76, fols.
3-9.</p>

<p>Laud. Misc. 594, fols. 136-137r,
beginning mutilated, opens “illius
signi et duodenarie ostendentis”
and ends “secunda si vero respiciens
tertia. Explicit liber de
quatuor partibus iudiciorum astronomiae
editus a magistro
Rogero de Hereford.” But the
closing words, “respiciens tertia,”
are those connected with the Incipit
of the <i>Book of Three General
Judgments</i> in Dijon 1045, a
good illustration of the complexities
of the problem.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Birth and
childhood.</div>

<p>In the year 1157 an Englishwoman was nursing two babies.
One was a foster child; the other, her own son. During the
next fifty years these two boys were to become prominent
in different fields. The fame of the one was to be unsurpassed
on the battlefield and in the world of popular music
and poetry. He was to become king of England, lord of
half of France, foremost of knights and crusaders, and the
idol of the troubadours. He was Richard, Cœur de Lion.
The other, in different fields and a humbler fashion, was
none the less also to attain prominence; he was to be clerk
and monk instead of king and crusader, and to win fame in
the domain of Latin learning rather than Provençal literature.
This was Alexander Neckam. Of his happy childhood
at St. Albans he tells us himself in Latin verse somewhat
suggestive of Gray’s lines on Eton:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Hic locus aetatis nostrae primordia novit</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Annos felices laetitiaeque dies</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Hic locus ingenuis pueriles imbuit annos</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Artibus et nostrae laudis origo fuit</i>,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Education.</div>

<p>A number of years of his life were spent as teacher
at Dunstable in a school under the control of the monastery
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
of St. Albans. It was at Paris, however, that he received
his higher education and also taught for a while. Scarcely
any place, he wrote late in life, was better known to him
than the city in whose schools he had been “a small pillar”
and where he “faithfully learned and taught the arts, then
turned to the study of Holy Writ, heard lectures in Canon
Law, and upon Hippocrates and Galen, and did not find Civil
Law distasteful.” This passage not only illustrates his own
broad education in the liberal arts, the two laws, medicine,
and theology, but also suggests that these four faculties were
already formed or forming at Paris. Neckam visited Italy,
as his humorous poem bidding Rome good-by attests, and
from two of the stories which he tells in <i>The Natures of
Things</i><a id="FNanchor_546" href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a> we may infer that he had been in Rouen and
Meaux. In 1213 Neckam was elected abbot of Cirencester,
and died in 1217. An amusing story is told in connection
with Neckam’s first becoming a monk. He is said to have
first applied for admission to a Benedictine monastery, but
when the abbot made a bad pun upon his good name, saying,
<i>Si bonus es, venias; si nequam, nequaquam</i> (If you are a
good man you may come; if Neckam, by no means), he
joined the Augustinians instead.<a id="FNanchor_547" href="#Footnote_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The state
of learning.</div>

<p>Neckam gives us a glimpse of the learned world of his
time as well as of his own education. He thinks past times
happy, when he recalls that “the greatest princes were diligent
and industrious in aiding investigation of nature,” and
that it was then commonly said, “An illiterate king is a
crowned ass.”<a id="FNanchor_548" href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a> But he is not ashamed of the schools of
his own day. After speaking of the learning of Greece and
Egypt in antiquity and stating that schools no longer flourish
in those lands, he exclaims, “But what shall I say of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
Salerno and Montpellier where the diligent skill of medical
students, serving the public welfare, provides remedies to
the whole world against bodily ills? Italy arrogates to itself
proficiency in the civil law, but celestial scripture and
the liberal arts prefer Paris to all other cities as their home.
And in accord with Merlin’s prophecy the wisdom now
flourishes at Oxford which in his time was in process of
transfer to Ireland.”<a id="FNanchor_549" href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a> Neckam’s assertion that there were
no schools in the Greece and Egypt of his day is interesting
as implying the insignificance of Byzantine and Mohammedan
learning in the second half of the twelfth century. He
perhaps does not think of Constantinople as in “Greece,”
but in Egypt he must certainly include Cairo, where the
mosque el-Azhar, devoted in 988 to educational purposes,
“has been ever since one of the chief universities of Islam.”<a id="FNanchor_550" href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a>
At any rate it is clear that to his mind the intellectual supremacy
has now passed to western Europe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Popular
science
and mechanical
arts.</div>

<p>In his praises of learning Neckam is a little too inclined,
like many other Latin writers, to speak slightingly of the
<i>vulgus</i> or common crowd. In antiquity, he affirms, the liberal
arts were the monopoly of free men; mechanical or
adulterine arts were for the ignoble.<a id="FNanchor_551" href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a> This does not mean,
however, that his eyes are closed to the value of practical
inventions, since both in <i>The Natures of Things</i> and his <i>De
utensilibus</i> we find what are perhaps the earliest references
to the mariner’s compass<a id="FNanchor_552" href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a> and to glass mirrors.<a id="FNanchor_553" href="#Footnote_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a> Indeed,
he often entertains us with popular gossip and superstition,
mentioning for the first time the belief in a man in the
moon,<a id="FNanchor_554" href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a> and telling such stories of daily life as that of the
lonely sailor whose dog helped him reef the sails and manage
the ropes of the boat in crossing the Channel,<a id="FNanchor_555" href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a> or of the
sea-fowl whose daily cry announced to the sheep in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
tidal meadow that it was time to seek higher pasture, until
one day its beak was caught by the shell of an oyster it tried
to devour and the sheep were drowned for lack of warning.<a id="FNanchor_556" href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">His
works.</div>

<p>Neckam’s writings were numerous, and, as might have
been expected from his wide studies, in varied fields. They
include grammatical treatises,<a id="FNanchor_557" href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a> works on Ovid and classical
mythology, commentaries upon the books of the Bible such
as the Psalms and Song of Songs, and the writings of Aristotle,
and other works of a literary, scientific, or theological
character.<a id="FNanchor_558" href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a> Most of them, however, if extant, are still in
manuscript. Only a few have been printed;<a id="FNanchor_559" href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a> among them is
<i>The Natures of Things</i> which we shall presently consider.</p>

<p>Neckam is a good illustration of the humanistic movement
in the twelfth century. He wrote Latin verse<a id="FNanchor_560" href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a> as well
as prose; took pains with and pride in his Latin style; and
shows acquaintance with a large number of classical authors.
He had some slight knowledge, at least, of Hebrew. He
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
was especially addicted, according to Wright,<a id="FNanchor_561" href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a> to those ingenious
but philologically absurd derivations of words in
which the <i>Etymologies</i> of Isidore of Seville had dealt, explaining,
for example, the Latin word for corpse (<i>cadaver</i>)
as compounded from the three roots seen in the words for
flesh (<i>caro</i>), given (<i>data</i>), to worms (<i>vermibus</i>). Yet in
one chapter of <i>The Natures of Things</i> Neckam attacks
“the verbal cavils” and use of obsolete words in his time as
“useless and frivolous,” and asks if one cannot be a good
jurist or physician or philosopher without all this linguistic
and verbal display.<a id="FNanchor_562" href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a> Wright, moreover, was also impressed
by Neckam’s interest in natural science, calling him “certainly
one of the most remarkable English men of science
in the twelfth century,”<a id="FNanchor_563" href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a> and noting that “he not infrequently
displays a taste for experimental science.”<a id="FNanchor_564" href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>De
naturis
rerum.</i></div>

<p><i>The Natures of Things</i>, however, is not primarily a
scientific or philosophical dissertation, as Alexander is careful
to explain in the preface, but a vehicle for moral instruction.
Natural phenomena are described, but following each
comes some moral application or spiritual allegory thereof.
The spots on the moon, for instance, are explained by some
as due to mountains and to depressions which the sun’s light
cannot reach, by others as due to the greater natural obscurity
of portions of the moon. Neckam adds that they are
for our instruction, showing how even the heavenly bodies
were stained by the sin of our first parents, and reminding
us that during this present life there will always be some
blot upon holy church, but that when all the planets and stars
shall stand as it were justified, our state too will become
stable, and both the material moon and holy church will be
spotless before the Lamb.<a id="FNanchor_565" href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a> Neckam intends to admire God
through His creatures and in so doing humbly to kiss as it
were the feet of the Creator. Despite this religious tone
and the moralizing, Wright regarded the work “as an interesting
monument of the history of science in western Europe
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
and especially in England during the latter half of the
twelfth century,”<a id="FNanchor_566" href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a> and as such we shall consider it. That
it was written before 1200 is to be inferred from a quotation
from it by a chronicler of John’s reign.<a id="FNanchor_567" href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a> It seems to have
been the best known of Neckam’s works. The brevity of
<i>The Natures of Things</i>, which consists of but two books,
if we omit the other three of its five books which consist of
commentaries upon <i>Genesis</i> and <i>Ecclesiastes</i>, hardly allows
us to call it an encyclopedia; but its title and arrangement
by topics and chapters closely resemble the later works which
are usually spoken of as medieval encyclopedias. Later in
life Neckam wrote a poetical paraphrase of it with considerable
changes, which is entitled <i>De laudibus divinae sapientiae</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Neckam’s
citations.</div>

<p>The citations of authorities in the <i>De naturis rerum</i> are
of much interest. A number of references to the law books
of Justinian show Neckam’s knowledge of the Roman law,<a id="FNanchor_568" href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a>
and, as we should expect after hearing of his commentary
upon Ovid’s <i>Metamorphoses</i>, allusions to that work, the
<i>Fasti</i>, and the <i>Ars amandi</i> are frequent. Claudian is once
quoted for two solid pages and considerable use is made of
other Latin poets such as Vergil, Lucan, Martial, and Juvenal.
Neckam believed that the diligent investigator could find
much that was useful in the inventions of the poets and that
beneath their fables moral instruction sometimes lay hid.<a id="FNanchor_569" href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a>
Neckam quotes Plato, perhaps indirectly, and repeats in
different words the fable of the crow and fox, as given in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
Apuleius.<a id="FNanchor_570" href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a> The church fathers are of course utilized&mdash;Augustine,
Jerome, Gregory, Basil, and a more recent theologian
like Anselm, archbishop of Canterbury; and familiarity
is shown with the early medieval standard authorities,
such as Boethius, Cassiodorus, Bede, and Isidore. Of writers
who may be regarded as dealing more particularly with
natural science there are mentioned Pliny and Solinus on
animals&mdash;but he seems to use Pliny very little and Solinus a
great deal, Macer and Dioscorides on the properties and effects
of herbs,<a id="FNanchor_571" href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a> while works in the domain of astronomy or
astrology are attributed to Julius (perhaps really Firmicus)
and Augustus Caesar as well as to Ptolemy.<a id="FNanchor_572" href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">His
knowledge
of Aristotle.</div>

<p>But what is most impressive is the frequent citation
from Euclid and Aristotle, especially the latter. Not only
the logical treatises are cited, but also the <i>History of
Animals</i><a id="FNanchor_573" href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a> and the <i>Liber Coeli et Mundi</i>, while allusion
is also made to Aristotle’s opinions concerning vision, motion,
melancholy, waters, and various astronomical matters.<a id="FNanchor_574" href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a>
Such passages&mdash;as well as the fact that commentaries on
Aristotle are ascribed to Neckam&mdash;suggest that Roger Bacon
was mistaken in the much-quoted passage in which he
states that the works of Aristotle on natural philosophy
were first introduced to the medieval (Latin) learned world
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
in Latin translations by Michael Scot about 1230. Neckam
perhaps cites the <i>History of Animals</i> indirectly: at any rate
he makes little use of it; but his numerous mentions of Aristotle’s
views on nature make it evident that “the truth
of Aristotelian” doctrine is already known in the twelfth
century. And he already regards “the most acute Aristotle”
as the pre-eminent authority among all philosophers. After
stating that “all philosophers generally seem to teach” that
the planets move in a contrary direction to the firmament
like flies walking on a rushing wheel, Neckam adds a number
of objections to this view, and adds, “It therefore was
the opinion of Aristotle, the most acute, that the planets
moved only with the firmament.” He then expresses his
amazement that the other philosophers should have dared to
oppose Aristotle, should have presumed to set their opinions
against so great a philosopher. It is as if a peacock spread
its spotted tail in rivalry with the starry sky, or as if owls
and bats should vie with the eagle’s unblinking eye in staring
at the mid-day sun.<a id="FNanchor_575" href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Use of
recent
authors.</div>

<p>That Neckam had some acquaintance with Arabic and
Jewish writers is indicated by his citing Alfraganus and
Isaac. Of Christian writers of the century before him Neckam
quotes from Hildebert, and four times from Bernard
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
Silvester. He cites the <i>Pantegni</i> or <i>Tegni</i> of Constantinus
Africanus more than once.<a id="FNanchor_576" href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a> He does not mention Adelard
of Bath by name but in discussing experiments with vacuums
repeats the experiment of the water jar. In another chapter
he states that, if the earth were perforated, an enormous
weight of lead would fall only to the center. Neckam’s chapter
on “Why in the same earth plants grow of contrary effects”
is similar to the third chapter of the <i>Natural Questions</i>
of Adelard, and his chapter on “Why certain animals
ruminate” is like Adelard’s seventh in the same work.<a id="FNanchor_577" href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Contemporary
opinion of
Neckam.</div>

<p>Roger Bacon, whose estimates of his contemporaries
have sometimes been accepted at too high a value, wrote of
Neckam some fifty years after Alexander’s death: “This
Alexander wrote true and useful books on many subjects,
but he cannot with justice be named as an authority.”<a id="FNanchor_578" href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a>
Bacon himself, however, seems on at least one occasion to
have used Neckam as an authority without naming him.<a id="FNanchor_579" href="#Footnote_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a>
On the other hand, another Englishman of note in science,
Alfred of Sarchel or Sareshel, dedicated his book on The
Movement of the Heart (<i>De motu cordis</i>) to Neckam.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His
attitude
toward
natural
science.</div>

<p>Whatever Neckam’s own scientific attainments may
have been, there can be no doubt that he had a high regard
for scientia and that he was not wanting in sympathetic appreciation
of the scientific spirit. This fact shines out in the
pages of the <i>De naturis rerum</i> amid its moral lessons and
spiritual illustrations, its erroneous etymologies and popular
anecdotes. “Science is acquired,” he says in one passage,
“at great expense, by frequent vigils, by great expenditure
of time, by sedulous diligence of labor, by vehement
application of mind.”<a id="FNanchor_580" href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a> But its acquisition abundantly justifies
itself even in practical life and destructive war. “What
craftiness of the foe is there that does not yield to the precise
knowledge of those who have tracked down the elusive
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
subtleties of things hidden in the very bosom of nature?”<a id="FNanchor_581" href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a>
He often cites these experts in natural science, whom he always
seems to regard with respect as authorities.<a id="FNanchor_582" href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a> Not that
he believes that they have solved all problems. Some things
forsooth are so hidden that it seems as if Nature is saying,
“This is my secret, this is my secret!”<a id="FNanchor_583" href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a> On the other hand,
there are many natural phenomena too familiar through
daily use and experience to need mention in books, since even
those who do not read are acquainted with them. Neckam
consequently will follow a middle course in selecting the
contents of his volume.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Science
and the
Bible.</div>

<p>Although a Christian clergyman, Neckam seems to experience
little difficulty in adopting the scientific theories
of Aristotle; or, if there are Aristotelian doctrines known
to him with which he disagrees, he usually quietly disregards
them.<a id="FNanchor_584" href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a> But he does raise the question several times
of the correctness of Biblical statements concerning nature.
He explains that Adam’s body was composed of all four
elements and not made merely from earth, as the account
of creation in the Book of Genesis might seem to imply.<a id="FNanchor_585" href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a>
And of the scriptural assertion that “God made two great
lights” he says, “The historical narrative follows the judgment
of the eye and the popular notion,” but of course the
moon is not one of the largest planets.<a id="FNanchor_586" href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a> In a third chapter
entitled, “That water is not lower than earth,” he notes that
the statement of the prophet that “God founded the earth
upon the waters” does not agree with Alfraganus’ dictum
that there is one sphere of earth and waters.<a id="FNanchor_587" href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a> Wright quite
unreasonably interprets this chapter as showing “to what a
degree science had become the slave of scriptural phraseology.”<a id="FNanchor_588" href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a>
What it really shows is just the contrary, for even
the Biblical expositors, Neckam tells us, say that the passage
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
is to be taken in the sense that one speaks of Paris as located
on the Seine. Neckam then makes a suggestion of his own,
that what is really above the waters is the terrestrial paradise,
since it is even beyond the sphere of the moon, and
Enoch, translated thither, suffered no inconvenience whatever
from the waters of the deluge. Moreover, the terrestrial
paradise symbolizes the church which is founded on
the waters of baptism. All of which is of course far-fetched
and fanciful, but in no way can be said to make science
“the slave of scriptural phraseology.” On the contrary it
makes scriptural phraseology the slave of mysticism, while
it subjects Enoch’s translation to somewhat material limitations.
Possibly there may be used here some of the apocryphal
books current under Enoch’s name.<a id="FNanchor_589" href="#Footnote_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a> On one occasion
Neckam does accept a statement of the Bible which seems inconsistent
with the views of philosophers concerning the four
elements. This is the assertion that after the day of judgment
there will be neither fire nor water but only air and
earth will be left. To an imaginary philosopher who seems
unwilling to accept this assertion Neckam says, “If you don’t
believe me, at least believe Peter, the chief of the apostles,
who says the same in his canonical epistle. Says what?
Says that fire and water will not exist after the judgment
day.”<a id="FNanchor_590" href="#Footnote_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a> But if Neckam prefers to believe his Bible as to
what will occur in the world of nature after the day of
judgment, he prefers also, as we have seen, to follow natural
science in regard to present natural phenomena. Moreover,
in neither the canonical nor apocryphal books can I find any
such statement in the Epistles of Peter as Neckam here
credits him with, unless after the elements have melted with
fervent heat, the new heavens and a new earth are to be
interpreted as made respectively of air and earth!</p>

<div class="sidenote">His own
knowledge
of science.</div>

<p>We may agree at least with Wright that Neckam’s scientific
attainments are considerable for his time. In physics
and astronomy he shows himself fairly well versed. He
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
knows something of vacuums and syphoning; he argues that
water tends naturally to take a spherical shape;<a id="FNanchor_591" href="#Footnote_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a> he twice
points out that the walls of buildings should not be exactly
parallel, since they should ultimately meet, if prolonged
far enough, at the center of the earth;<a id="FNanchor_592" href="#Footnote_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a> and he asserts
that the so-called “antipodes” are no more under our
feet than we are under theirs.<a id="FNanchor_593" href="#Footnote_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a> He gives us what is perhaps
our earliest information of some medieval inventions,
such as the mariner’s compass and mirrors of glass.<a id="FNanchor_594" href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a> But
he does not attempt to explain differences in the images in
convex and concave mirrors.<a id="FNanchor_595" href="#Footnote_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a> He is modest in regard to
his biological attainments, saying that he “is not ashamed
to confess” that there are species of which he does not even
know the names, to say nothing of their natures.<a id="FNanchor_596" href="#Footnote_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a> But when
Wright calls Neckam’s account of animals “a mere compilation”
and says that “much of it is taken from the old writers,
such as Solinus, Isidore, and Cassiodorus,”<a id="FNanchor_597" href="#Footnote_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a> he is basing
his conclusion simply on the fact that marginal notes in the
medieval manuscripts themselves ascribe a number of passages
to these authors. This ascription is correct. But there
are many passages on animals where the manuscripts name
no authorities, and with one exception&mdash;the chapter on the
hyena from Solinus&mdash;Wright fails to name any source from
which Neckam has borrowed these other passages. It is
easy to show that Neckam is a compiler when he himself
or others have stated his authorities but it is equally fair to
suppose that he is honest and original when he cites no
authorities or has not been detected in borrowing. And he
sometimes criticizes or discriminates between the earlier
writers. After quoting Bernard Silvester’s statement that
the beaver castrates itself to escape its hunters, he adds, “But
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
those who are more reliably informed as to the natures of
things assert that Bernard has followed the ridiculous popular
notion and not reached the true fact.”<a id="FNanchor_598" href="#Footnote_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a> Neckam also
questions the belief that a lynx has such keen sight that it
can see through nine walls. This is supposed to have been
demonstrated experimentally by observing a lynx with nine
walls between it and a person carrying some raw meat. The
lynx will move along its side of the walls whenever the meat
is moved on the other side and will stop opposite the spot
where the person carrying the meat stops. Neckam does not
question the accuracy of this absurd experiment, but remarks
that some natural scientists attribute it rather to the
animal’s sense of smell than to its power of vision.<a id="FNanchor_599" href="#Footnote_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Incredible
stories of
animals.</div>

<p>But as a rule Neckam’s treatment of animals is far
more credulous than sceptical. He believes that the barnacle
bird is generated from fir-wood which has been soaked
in the salt water for a long time,<a id="FNanchor_600" href="#Footnote_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a> and that the wren, after
it has been killed and is being roasted, turns itself on the
spit.<a id="FNanchor_601" href="#Footnote_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a> He tells a number of delightful but incredible stories
in which animals display remarkable sagacity and manifest
emotions and motives similar to those of human beings.
Some of these tales concern particular pets or wild beasts;
others are of the habits of a species. The hawk, for example,
keeps warm on wintry nights by seizing some other
bird in its claws and holding it tight against its own body;
but when day returns it gratefully releases this bird and satisfies
its morning appetite upon some other victim.<a id="FNanchor_602" href="#Footnote_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a> Neckam
also shares the common belief that animals were acquainted
with the medicinal virtues of herbs. When the
weasel is wounded by a venomous animal, it hastens to seek
salubrious plants. For “educated by nature, it knows the
virtues of herbs, although it has neither studied medicine at
Salerno nor been drilled in the schools at Montpellier.”<a id="FNanchor_603" href="#Footnote_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span></p><div class="sidenote">A chapter
on the
cock.</div>

<p>Neckam’s chapter on the barnyard cock perhaps will illustrate
the divergences between medieval and modern science
as well as any other. As a rooster approaches old age, he
sometimes lays an egg upon which a toad sits, and from
which is hatched the basilisk. How is it that the cock “distinguishes
the hours by his song”? From great heat ebullition
of the humors within the said bird arises, it produces
saltiness, the saltiness causes itching, from the itching comes
tickling, from the tickling comes delectation, and delectation
excites one to song. Now nature sets certain periods to the
movements of humors and therefore the cock crows at
certain hours. But why have roosters crests and hens not?
This is because of their very moist brains and the presence
near the top of their heads of some bones which are not
firmly joined. So the gross humor arising from the humidity
escapes through the openings and produces the crest.<a id="FNanchor_604" href="#Footnote_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Effect of
sin upon
nature.</div>

<p>Neckam harbored the notion, which we met long before
in the pagan Philostratus, in the Hebraic Enoch literature,
in the Christian <i>Pseudo-Clementines</i> and Basil’s <i>Hexaemeron</i>,
and more recently in the writings of Hildegard,
that man’s sin has its physical effects upon nature. To
Adam’s fall he attributes not only the spots on the moon
but the wildness of most animals, and the existence of insects
to plague, and venomous animals to poison, and diseases
to injure mankind.<a id="FNanchor_605" href="#Footnote_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a> But for the fall of man, moreover,
all living creatures would be subsisting upon a vegetarian
diet.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Neckam
on occult
virtues.</div>

<p>Magic is hardly mentioned in the <i>De naturis rerum</i>. In
a passage, however, telling how Aristotle ordered some of
his subtlest works to be buried with him, Neckam adds that
he so guarded the neighborhood of his sepulcher “by some
mysterious force of nature or power of art, not to say feat
of the magic art, that no one in those days could enter it.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span><a id="FNanchor_606" href="#Footnote_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a>
But Neckam is a believer in occult virtues and to a certain
extent in astrology. He would also seem to believe in the
force of incantations from his assertion that “in words and
herbs and stones diligent investigators of nature have discovered
great virtue. Most certain experience, moreover,
makes our statement trustworthy.”<a id="FNanchor_607" href="#Footnote_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a> He mentions a much
smaller number of stones than Marbod, but ascribes the
same occult virtues to those which he does name. In the
preface to his first book he says that some gems have greater
virtue when set in silver than when set in gold. A tooth
separated from the jaw of a wild boar remains sharp only
as long as the animal remains alive, an interesting bit of
sympathetic magic.<a id="FNanchor_608" href="#Footnote_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a> The occult property of taming wild
bulls possessed by the fig-tree which we have already seen
noted by various authors is also remarked by Neckam.<a id="FNanchor_609" href="#Footnote_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a>
A moonbeam shining through a narrow aperture in the wall
of a stable fell directly on a sore on a horse’s back and caused
the death of a groom standing nearby. Out-of-doors the
effect would not have been fatal, since the force of the
moon’s rays would not have been so concentrated upon one
spot and the humidity would have had a better chance to
diffuse through space.<a id="FNanchor_610" href="#Footnote_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Fascination.</div>

<p>After telling of the fatal glances of the basilisk and wolf,
Neckam says that fascination is explained as due to evil rays
from someone who looks at you. He adds that nurses lick
the face of a child who has been fascinated.<a id="FNanchor_611" href="#Footnote_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">His
limited
belief in
astrology.</div>

<p>Neckam will not believe that the seven planets are animals.<a id="FNanchor_612" href="#Footnote_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a>
He does believe, however, that they not merely adorn
the heavens but exert upon inferiors those effects which God
has assigned to them.<a id="FNanchor_613" href="#Footnote_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a> Each planet rules in turn three hours
of the day. As there are twenty-four hours in all, the last
three hours of each day are governed by the same planet
which ruled the first three. Hence the names of the days
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>in the planetary week, Sunday being the day when the sun
governs the first three and last three hours, Monday the day
when the moon controls the opening and closing hours of
day, and so on.<a id="FNanchor_614" href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a> But the stars do not impose necessity upon
the human will which remains free. Nevertheless the planet
Mars, for instance, bestows the gift of counsel; and science
is associated with the planet Venus which is hot and moist,
as are persons of sanguine temperament in whom science is
wont to flourish. Neckam also associates each of the seven
planets which illuminate the universe with one of the seven
liberal arts which shed light on all knowledge.<a id="FNanchor_615" href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a> He alludes
to the great year of which the philosophers tell, when after
36,000 years the stars complete their courses,<a id="FNanchor_616" href="#Footnote_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a> and to the

of an octave, the eighth sphere of the fixed stars completes
the harmony of the seven planets. But he fears that someone

<div class="sidenote">Neckam’s
farewell.</div>

<p>At Jesus College, Oxford, in a manuscript of the early
thirteenth century, which is exclusively devoted to religious
writings by Neckam,<a id="FNanchor_618" href="#Footnote_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a> there occurs at the close an address
of the author to his work, which is in the same hand as the
rest of the manuscript, which we may therefore not unreasonably
suppose to have been Neckam’s own writing. As
he is spoken of in the manuscript as abbot of Cirencester,
perhaps these are also actually the last words he wrote. We
may therefore appropriately terminate our account of
Neckam by quoting them.</p>

<p>“Perchance, O book, you will survive Alexander, and
worms will eat me before the book-worm gnaws you; for my
body is due the worms and book-worms will demolish you.
You are the mirror of my soul, the interpreter of my meditations,
the surest index of my meaning, the faithful messenger
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
of my mind’s emotions, the sweet comforter of my
grief, the true witness of my conscience. To you as faithful
depositary I have confided my heart’s secrets; you restore
faithfully to me those things which I have committed to
your trust; in you I read myself. You will come, you will
come into the hands of some pious reader who will deign
to pour forth prayers for me. Then indeed, little book, you
will profit your master; then you will recompense your
Alexander by a most grateful interchange. There will come,
nor do I begrudge my labor, the devotion of a pious reader,
who will now let you repose in his lap, now move you to his
breast, sometimes place you as a sweet pillow beneath his
head, sometimes gently closing you with glad hands, he will
fervently pray for me to Lord Jesus Christ, who with Father
and Holy Spirit lives and reigns God through infinite
cycles of ages. Amen.”</p>

there was printed under the name

according to the catalogue
and contains this interesting inscription,

the substance of these two passages
is found in Pliny’s <i>Natural
History</i>, he does not mention
Aristotle in these connections nor
use the Greek word “narcos.”
Moreover, Neckam seems to give
credit as a rule to his immediate
sources and not to copy their citations;
as we have seen, he credited
the fable of the fox and crow to
Apuleius and not to Aesop to
whom Apuleius credits it.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_575" href="#FNanchor_575" class="label">[575]</a> It would therefore seem that
Professor Haskins (EHR, 30, 68)
is scarcely justified in saying that
“the natural philosophy and metaphysics
of Aristotle” are “cited in
part but not utilized by Alexander
Neckam,” especially since he
states presently that “Neckam
himself seems to have been acquainted
with the <i>Metaphysics,
De Anima</i>, and <i>De generatione et
corruptione</i>” (<i>Ibid</i>., 69, and “A
List of Textbooks,” <i>Harvard
Studies</i>, XX (1909), 75-94). Professor
Haskins, however, believes
that the new Aristotle was by this
time penetrating England, but
gives the main credit for this to
Alfredus Anglicus or Alfred of
Sareshel, the author of the <i>De
motu cordis</i>, and the translator of
the Pseudo-Aristotelian <i>De vegetabilibus</i>
and of an appendix to
the <i>Meteorologica</i> consisting of
three chapters <i>De congelatis</i>, also
translated from the Arabic.
Alfred was no isolated figure in
English learning, since he dedicated
the <i>De vegetabilibus</i> to
Roger of Hereford and the <i>De
motu cordis</i> to Neckam: ed.
Baruch, Innsbruck, 1878; and see
Baeumker, <i>Die Stellung des Alfred
von Sareshel ... in der Wissenschaft
des beginnenden XIII
Jahrts., München, Sitzber</i>. (1913),
No. 9. On the whole it is probably
safe to assume that his
knowledge of Aristotle was soon
at least, if not from the start,
shared with others. Grabmann
(1916), pp. 22-25, adds nothing
new on the subject of Neckam’s
knowledge of Aristotle.</p>

the intricacies of his full Arabic name. In the Latin versions
of his works he is spoken of as Rabbi Moyses of
Cordova<a id="FNanchor_620" href="#Footnote_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a> or is made to call himself an Israelite of Cordova,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span><a id="FNanchor_621" href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a>
but it seems to have been not much more than the scene of
his birth and childhood, since the invasion of the fanatical
Almohades in 1148 forced his father to flee with his family
first from place to place in Spain, in 1160 to Fez, later to
Syria and Egypt. From about 1165 on Maimonides seems
to have lived most of the time at Cairo and there to have
done most of his work. After the deaths of his father and
brother forced him to earn a livelihood by practicing medicine,
he became physician to the vizier of Saladin and head
of the Jewish community in Cairo.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His works
in the
west.</div>

<p>Whether or not he returned to Spain before his death in
1204, he was certainly known to the western world of
learning. In 1194 he wrote a letter on the subject of astrology
in response to inquiries which he had received from
Jews of Marseilles.<a id="FNanchor_622" href="#Footnote_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a> In it he tells them that his <i>Repetition
of the Law</i> (<i>Iteratio legis</i>) has already spread through the
island of Sicily. But he apparently was still in Cairo, where
in July, 1198, he wrote his treatise on Poisons for the Cadi
Fadhil.<a id="FNanchor_623" href="#Footnote_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a> After his death, however, it was between the conservative
and liberal parties among the Jews of France and
Spain that a struggle ensued over the orthodoxy of his
works, which was finally settled, we are told, by reference
in 1234 to the Christian authorities, who ordered his books
to be burned. His <i>Guide for the Perplexed</i>, first published
in Egypt in Arabic in 1190, had been translated into Hebrew
at Lunel in southern France before the close of the twelfth
century, and then again by a Spanish poet.<a id="FNanchor_624" href="#Footnote_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a> But the rabbis
of northern France opposed the introduction of Maimonides’
works there and, when they were anathematized for it by
those of the south, are said to have reported the writings
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
to the Inquisition. The Maimonist party then accused them
of delation and several of them were punished by having
their tongues cut out.<a id="FNanchor_625" href="#Footnote_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">His works
in Latin.</div>

<p>If certain Christian authorities really did thus burn the
books of Maimonides, their action was unavailing to check
the spread of his writings even in Christian lands, and certainly
was not characteristic of the attitude of Christian
Latin learning in general. <i>The Guide of the Perplexed</i>
had already been translated into Latin before 1234,<a id="FNanchor_626" href="#Footnote_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a> and
we find Moses of Cordova cited by such staunch churchmen
as Alexander of Hales, Albertus Magnus,<a id="FNanchor_627" href="#Footnote_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a> Thomas Aquinas,
and Vincent of Beauvais. It was for Pope Clement V himself
that Ermengard Blasius of Montpellier translated at
Barcelona Maimonides’ work on Poisons at the beginning of
the fourteenth century from Arabic into Latin.<a id="FNanchor_628" href="#Footnote_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Attitude
to science
and
religion.</div>

<p>It was not surprising that Albert and Aquinas should
cite Maimonides, for he did for Jewish thought what
they attempted for Christian, namely, the reconciliation
of Aristotle and the Bible, philosophy and written revelation.
If he anteceded them in this and perhaps to some
extent showed them the way, we must remember that
William of Conches, who was earlier than he, had already
faced this difficulty of the relations between science and
religion, the scriptures and the writings of the philosophers,
although he of course did not know all the books of Aristotle.
As for Maimonides, continuing the allegorical
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
method of Philo, he tried to discover in the Old Testament
and Talmud all the Aristotelian philosophy, and was convinced
that the prophets of old had received further revelations
of a philosophical character, which had been transmitted
orally for a time but then lost during the periods
of Jewish wandering and persecution.<a id="FNanchor_629" href="#Footnote_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a> He defended Moses
from the slurs of Galen who had charged the lawgiver with
an unscientific attitude.<a id="FNanchor_630" href="#Footnote_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a> He denied the eternity of matter<a id="FNanchor_631" href="#Footnote_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a>
and of the heavens,<a id="FNanchor_632" href="#Footnote_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a> but held that the celestial bodies were
living animated beings and that the heavenly spheres were
conscious and free.<a id="FNanchor_633" href="#Footnote_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a> He spoke of belief in demons as “idle
and fallacious,” holding that evil is mere privation and
that the personal Devil of Scripture was an allegory for this,
while the possession by demons was merely the disease of
melancholy.<a id="FNanchor_634" href="#Footnote_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a> Yet he believed that God does nothing without
the mediation of an angel and that belief in the existence
of angels is only second in importance to a belief in
God.<a id="FNanchor_635" href="#Footnote_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a> Thus the rationalism and scepticism which modern
Jewish admirers have ascribed to Maimonides had their
decided limitations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Attitude
to
magic.</div>

<p>An interesting discussion of magic occurs in the <i>Guide
for the Perplexed</i><a id="FNanchor_636" href="#Footnote_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a> in connection with the precepts of the
Mosaic law against idolatry. Maimonides holds that magicians
and diviners are closely akin to idolaters, and this
part of his discussion is very similar to patristic treatments
which we have already encountered. He goes on, however,
to say that astrology and magic were especially characteristic
of the Chaldeans, Egyptians, and Canaanites, and
to distinguish three varieties of magic: one employing the
properties of plants, animals and metals; a second determining
the times when these works should be performed;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
a third employing gesticulations, actions, and cries of the
human operator himself. Thus he recognizes the three elements
of materials, times, and rites in magic. He sees that
they may be combined in one operation, as when an herb is
plucked when the moon is in a specified degree. He notes
that magic is largely performed by women, towards whom
men are more merciful than towards their own sex. He
also notes that magicians claim to do good or at least to
ward off evils such as snakes and wild beasts or the blight
from plants. But the lawgiver forbade “all those practices
which contrary to natural science are said to produce utility
by special and occult virtues and properties, ... such forsooth
as proceed not from a natural cause but a magical
operation and which rely upon the constellations to such
a degree as to involve worship and veneration of them.”<a id="FNanchor_637" href="#Footnote_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Towards
empiricism.</div>

<p>But then Maimonides goes on to say that “everything
is licit in which any natural cause appears.” And he goes
farther than that. He says that the reader need not feel
uneasy because the rabbis have allowed the use in suspensions
of a nail from the yoke worn by criminals or the
tooth of a fox. “For in those times they placed faith in
these things because they were confirmed by experience
and served in the place of medicine.” Similarly in
Maimonides’ own day Galen’s remedy of the suspension of
a peony from the patient’s neck was employed in cases of
epilepsy, dog’s dung was used against pustules and sore
throat, and so forth. “For whatever is proved by experience
to be true, although no natural cause may be apparent,
its use is permitted, because it acts as a medicine.” Thus he
condemns magic, but approves of empirical medicine as well
as of natural science, and evidently does not regard the employment
of occult virtues as necessarily magical and forbidden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Abuse of
divine
names.</div>

<p>In another passage of the <i>Guide</i> Maimonides cautions,
however, against the abuse of divine names, and, while he
holds to the Tetragrammaton “which is written but is not
pronounced as it is spelled,” deplores the many inventions
of meaningless and inefficacious names which superstitious
and insane men have too often imposed upon the credulity
of good men as possessed of peculiar sanctity and purity
and having the virtue of working miracles. He therefore
warns his readers against such “amulets or experimental
charts.”<a id="FNanchor_638" href="#Footnote_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Occult
virtue and
empirical
remedies
in his
work on
poisons.</div>

<p>Maimonides again approves of empirical remedies and
of occult virtues in his treatise on poisons. He holds that
counter-poisons do not act by any physical or chemical
quality but by their entire substance or by a special property.<a id="FNanchor_639" href="#Footnote_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a>
Lemon pips, peeled and applied in a compress; a
powdered emerald, which should be a beautiful green, quite
transparent, and of good water; and the animal bezoar,
which comes from the eyes or gall bladder of deer; these are
antidotes whose efficacy is proved by incontestible experimentation.
When <i>terra sigillata</i> cannot be had, a powdered
emerald of the sort just described may be substituted for
it as an ingredient in the grand theriac.<a id="FNanchor_640" href="#Footnote_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a> Maimonides believes
that this last named remedy is the outcome of experiments
with vipers carried on through the course of centuries
by ancient philosophers and physicians.<a id="FNanchor_641" href="#Footnote_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a> As for the stone
<i>bezoar</i>, the writings of the moderns are full of marvelous
tales concerning it, but Galen does not mention it, and
Maimonides has tried all the varieties which he could obtain
against scorpion bites without the least success. But
experience confirms the virtue of the <i>bezoar</i> of animal
origin, as has been stated. Maimonides’ observations concerning
cures for the bites of mad dogs are interesting. He
states that at first the bite of a mad dog does not feel any
different from that of a dog who is not mad. He also
warns his readers not to trust to books to distinguish between
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
the two, but unless they are sure that the dog was not mad,
to keep on the safe side by taking the remedies against the
bite of a mad dog.<a id="FNanchor_642" href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a> He also states that all of the various
remedies listed for the cure of the bite of a mad dog must
be employed before hydrophobia manifests itself, “for after
the appearance of that symptom, I have never seen a patient
survive.”<a id="FNanchor_643" href="#Footnote_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a> In speaking of sucking the venom from a
wound, Maimonides affirms that it is better to have this
done by a fasting person, since the spittle of such a person
is itself hostile to poisons.<a id="FNanchor_644" href="#Footnote_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Attitude
to astrology.</div>

<p>That Maimonides was well acquainted with the art of
astrology may be inferred from his assertion that he has
read every book in Arabic on the subject.<a id="FNanchor_645" href="#Footnote_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a> Maimonides
not only believed that the stars were living, animated beings
and that there were as many pure intelligences as there were
spheres,<a id="FNanchor_646" href="#Footnote_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a> but he states twice in the <i>Guide for the Perplexed</i><a id="FNanchor_647" href="#Footnote_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a>
that all philosophers agree that this inferior world of
generation and corruption is ruled by the virtues and influences
of the celestial spheres. While their influence is
diffused through all things, each star or planet also has
particular species especially under its influence. According
to Lévy<a id="FNanchor_648" href="#Footnote_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a> he further held not only that the movement of
the celestial sphere starts every motion in the universe, but
that every soul has its origin in the soul of the celestial
sphere. In his letter on astrology to the Jews of Marseilles
he repeats that all the philosophers have held, and that Hebrew
masters of the past have agreed with them, that whatever
is in this inferior world the blessed God has brought
about by that virtue which arises from the spheres and
stars. As God performs signs and miracles by angels, so
natural processes and operations by the spheres and stars
which are animated and endowed with knowledge and
science. All this is true and in no way derogates from the
Jewish faith. But Maimonides regards as folly and not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
wisdom the doctrine found in Arabic works of astrology that
a man’s nativity compels everything to happen to him just
as it does and in no otherwise. He regards this doctrine
as derived from the Chaldeans, Egyptians, and Canaanites
and makes the rather rash assertion that no Greek philosopher
ever wrote a book of this sort. This doctrine would
make no distinction between a man whom a lion meets and
tears limb from limb and the mouse which a cat plays with.
It would make men warring for kingdoms no different from
dogs fighting over a carcass. These illustrations may
seem to the reader rather favorable to the doctrine which
Maimonides is endeavoring to combat, but he upholds
human free will and man’s responsibility for his actions,
which he declares are fundamental tenets of the Jewish
law. For some reason which is not clear to me he identifies
the doctrine of nativities and the control of human destiny
by the constellations with the rule of blind chance and the
happening of everything fortuitously, which would seem
quite a different matter and third alternative.<a id="FNanchor_649" href="#Footnote_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a> Maimonides
holds that God planned all human affairs beforehand, and
that just as He planned the course of nature so as to allow
for the occurrence of miracles, so He planned human affairs
in such a way that men could be held responsible and
punished for their sins. Maimonides regards the rule of
chance and the doctrine of nativities as incompatible with
this.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Divination
and
prophecy.</div>

<p>Yet Maimonides believed in a human faculty of natural
divination, stating that the ability to conjecture and divine
is found in all men to some degree, and that in some imagination
and divination are so strong and sure that they correctly
forecast all future events or the greater part of them.<a id="FNanchor_650" href="#Footnote_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a>
The difference between true prophets and the diviners and
observers of times “is that the observers of times, diviners,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
and such men, some of their words may be fulfilled and
some of them may not be fulfilled.”<a id="FNanchor_651" href="#Footnote_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Marvels
in the
<i>Aphorisms</i></div>

<p>In his <i>Aphorisms</i> which are drawn largely from the
works of Galen Maimonides repeats many marvelous stories,
instances of belief in occult virtue, and medical methods
bordering upon the practice of magic.<a id="FNanchor_652" href="#Footnote_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a> Most of these have
already been mentioned in our chapters upon Galen and
need not be reiterated here. It is perhaps worth noting that
Maimonides displays some critical sense as to the authenticity
of works ascribed to Galen. He does not accept as
his a treatise forbidding the burial of a man until twenty-four
hours after his supposed death, although the patriarch
who translated it from Greek into Arabic regarded it as
Galen’s. Maimonides suggests that it may be by some other
Galen than the great physician “whose books are well
known.” Maimonides also notes that in the work of Hippocrates
on female ailments which Galen commented upon
and Hunain translated there have been added many statements
of a marvelous character by some third hand.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Prince
Khalid
ibn Jazid
and <i>The
Book of
Morienus</i>.</div>

<p>Al-Mas’udi, who lived from about 885 to 956 A. D., has
preserved a single recipe for making gold from the
alchemical poem, <i>The Paradise of Wisdom</i>, originally consisting
of some 2315 verses and written by the Ommiad
prince, Khalid ibn Jazid (635-704 A. D.) of Alexandria.
Other Arabic writers of the ninth and tenth centuries represent
this prince as interested in natural science and medicine,
alchemy and astrology, and as the first to promote
translations from the Greek and Coptic. Thus the alchemistic
<i>Book of Crates</i> is said to have been translated either by
him or under his direction. The <i>Fihrist</i> further states that
Khalid was instructed in alchemy by one Morienes, who
was himself a disciple of Adfar.<a id="FNanchor_653" href="#Footnote_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a> There is still extant, but
only in Latin translation, what purports to be the book of
this same Morienes, or Morienus as he is called in Latin,
addressed to this same Khalid. The book cites or invents
various Greek alchemists but claims the Thrice-Great
Hermes as its original author. It is of this work that we
shall now treat as the first of a number of medieval Hermetic
books.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Robert of
Chester’s
preface.</div>

<p>One of the earliest treatises of alchemy translated from
Arabic into Latin would appear to be this which Morienus
Romanus, a hermit of Jerusalem, edited for “Calid, king of
the Egyptians,” and which Robert of Chester turned into
Latin<a id="FNanchor_654" href="#Footnote_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a> on the eleventh day of February in the year 1182
of the Spanish era or 1144 A. D. Of Robert’s other translations
we have spoken elsewhere.<a id="FNanchor_655" href="#Footnote_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a> He opens his preface
to the present treatise with an account of three Hermeses&mdash;Enoch,
Noah, and the king, philosopher, and prophet who
reigned in Egypt after the flood and was called Hermes
Triplex. This account is very similar to one which we
shall presently find prefixed to an astrological treatise by
Hermes Trismegistus. It was this Hermes, Robert continues,
who rediscovered and edited all the arts and sciences
after the deluge, and who first found and published the present
work, which is a book divine and most replete with
divinity, and which is entitled, <i>The Book of the Composition
of Alchemy</i>. “And since,” says Robert, “what alchemy
is and what is its composition, your Latin world does not
yet know truly,<a id="FNanchor_656" href="#Footnote_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a> I will elucidate the same in the present
treatise.” Alchemy is that substance which joins the more
precious bodies which are compounded from one original
matter and by this same natural union converts them to
the higher type. In other words, it is the philosopher’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
stone by which metals may be transmuted. Although Robert
is a relatively young man and his Latinity perhaps not
of the best, he essays the task of translating this so great
and important a work and reveals his own name in the
preface lest some other person steal the fruits of his labor
and the praise which is his due. Lippmann dismisses the
translation rather testily as “surpassed by no later work for
emptiness, confusion, and sheer drivel,”<a id="FNanchor_657" href="#Footnote_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a> but we shall attempt
some further description.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
story of
Morienus
and Calid.</div>

<p>Following Robert’s preface comes an account, in the
usual style of apocryphal and occult works, told partly in
the first person by Morienus and partly of him in the third
person by someone else. Long after Christ’s passion an
Adfar of Alexandria found the book of Hermes, mastered
it after long study, and himself gave forth innumerable
precepts which were spread abroad and finally reached the
ears of Morienus, then a young man at Rome. This reminds
us of the opening of the <i>Recognitions</i> of Clement. Morienus
left his home, parents, and native land, and hastened to
Alexandria to the house of Adfar. When Adfar learned
that Morienus was a Christian, he promised to divulge to
him “the secrets of all divinity,” which he had hitherto kept
concealed from nearly everyone. When Adfar died,
Morienus left Alexandria and became a hermit at Jerusalem.
Not many years thereafter a king arose in Egypt
named Macoya. He begat a son named Gezid who reigned
after his father’s death and in his turn begat a son named
Calid who reigned after his death. This Calid was a great
patron of science and searched all lands for someone who
could reveal this book of Hermes to him. Morienus was
still living, and when a traveler brought him news of Calid
and his desire, he came to his court, not for the sake of
the gifts of gold which the king had offered, but in order
to instruct him with spiritual gifts. Saluting Calid with
the words, “O good king, may God convert you to a better,”
he asked for a house or laboratory in which to prepare his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
masterpiece of perfection, but departed secretly as soon as
it was consummated. When Calid saw the gold which
Morienus had made, he ordered the heads to be cut off of
all the other alchemists whom he had employed for years,
and grieved that the hermit had left without revealing his
secret.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
secret of
the philosopher’s
stone</div>

<p>More years passed before Calid’s trusty slave, Galip,
learned the identity and whereabouts of Morienus from another
hermit of Jerusalem and was despatched with a large
retinue to bring him back. The king and the hermit at
first engaged in a moral and religious discussion, and many
days passed before Calid ventured to broach the subject of
alchemy. He then put to Morienus a succession of questions,
such as whether there is one fundamental substance,
and concerning the nature and color of the philosopher’s
stone, also its natural composition, weight and taste, cheapness
or expensiveness, rarity or abundance, and whether
there is any other stone like unto it or which has its effect.
This last query Morienus answered in the negative, since in
the philosopher’s stone are contained the four elements and
it is like unto the universe and the composition of the universe.
In the process of obtaining it decay must come first,
then purification. As in human generation, there must first
be <i>coitus</i>, then conception, then pregnancy, then birth, then
nutrition. To such general observations and analogies,
which are commonplaces of alchemy, are finally added several
pages of specific directions as to alchemistic operations.
Such enigmatic nomenclature is employed as “white smoke,”
and “green lion,” but Morienus later explains to Calid the
significance of most of these phrases. “Green lion” is glass;
“impure body” is lead; “pure body” is tin, and so on.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Later
works of

ascribed
to Hermes.</div>

<p>In so far as I have examined the alchemical manuscripts
of the later middle ages,<a id="FNanchor_658" href="#Footnote_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a> which I have not done very
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
extensively owing to the fact that most of them consist of
anonymous and spurious compositions which are probably
of a later date than the period with which we are directly
concerned,<a id="FNanchor_659" href="#Footnote_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a> I have hardly found as many treatises ascribed
to Hermes Trismegistus as might be expected. Perhaps as
many works are ascribed to Aristotle, Geber, and other
famous names as to Hermes or Mercury. Thus out of some
forty items in an alchemical miscellany of the fourteenth
or fifteenth century<a id="FNanchor_660" href="#Footnote_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a> two are attributed to Hermes and
Mercury, two to Aristotle, one to Plato, three to Geber,
two to Albertus Magnus, and others to his contemporaries
like Roger Bacon, Brother Elias, Bonaventura, and Arnald
of Villanova. Of the two titles connected with Hermes
one is simply a <i>Book of Hermes</i>; the other, <i>A Treatise of
Mercury to his disciple Mirnesindus</i>. Other specimens of
works ascribed to Hermes in medieval Latin manuscripts
are: <i>The Secrets of Hermes the philosopher, inventor of
metals, according to the nature of transmutation</i><a id="FNanchor_661" href="#Footnote_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a> or in another
manuscript, “inventor of transformation,”<a id="FNanchor_662" href="#Footnote_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a> a treatise
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
on the fountain of youth by Trismegistus;<a id="FNanchor_663" href="#Footnote_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a> and a work on
alcohol ascribed to “father Hermes.”<a id="FNanchor_664" href="#Footnote_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a> The Early English
Text Society has reprinted an English translation of the
Latin treatise on the fifth essence “that Hermes, the prophet
and king of Egypt, after the flood of Noah, father of
philosophers, had by revelation of an angel of God to him
sent,” which was first published “about 1460-1476 by Fred
J. Furnival.”<a id="FNanchor_665" href="#Footnote_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a> “The book of Hermogenes” is also to be
accredited to Hermes Trismegistus.<a id="FNanchor_666" href="#Footnote_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Medieval
citations
of
Hermes</div>

<p>Among the Arabs and in medieval Latin learning the
reputation of Hermes continued not only as an alchemist,
but as a fountain of wisdom in general. Roger Bacon spoke
of “Hermes Mercurius, the father of philosophers.”<a id="FNanchor_667" href="#Footnote_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a>
Daniel of Morley we have heard cite works of Trismegistus
and distinguish between “two most excellent authorities,”
the “great Mercury,” and his nephew, “Trismegistus Mercurius.”<a id="FNanchor_668" href="#Footnote_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a>
Albertus Magnus cited “The so-called <i>Sacred
Book</i> of Hermes to Asclepius,”<a id="FNanchor_669" href="#Footnote_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a> an astrological treatise of
which the Greek version has been mentioned in our earlier
chapter on Hermes, Orpheus, and Zoroaster. And Albert’s
contemporary, William of Auvergne, bishop of Paris, makes
use several times<a id="FNanchor_670" href="#Footnote_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a> of the dialogue between Mercurius Trismegistus,
“the Egyptian philosopher and magician,” and
Asclepius from a <i>Liber de hellera</i> or <i>De deo deorum</i>,
which is presumably the Greek Ἱερὰ βίβλος. Trismegistus is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
represented as affirming that there is divine power in herbs
and stones. In the <i>Speculum astronomiae</i><a id="FNanchor_671" href="#Footnote_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a> Albert listed a
number of bad books on necromantic images<a id="FNanchor_672" href="#Footnote_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a> by Hermes
of which Christians were to beware: a book of images for
each of the seven planets, an eighth treatise following them,
a work on <i>The seven rings of the seven planets</i>, a book of
magical illusions (<i>liber praestigiorum</i>),<a id="FNanchor_673" href="#Footnote_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a> and a book addressed
to Aristotle. William of Auvergne seems to allude
to the same literature when he twice repeats a story of two
fallen angels from Hermes, citing his <i>Seven Planets</i> in one
case and <i>Book of Venus</i> in the other.<a id="FNanchor_674" href="#Footnote_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a> Albertus Magnus
also cites “books of incantations” by Hermes in his work
on vegetables and plants;<a id="FNanchor_675" href="#Footnote_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a> and a <i>Liber Alcorath</i> is ascribed
to Hermes in the <i>Liber aggregationis</i> or <i>Experimenta
Alberti</i> which is current under Albert’s name. The astrologer
Cecco d’Ascoli in the early fourteenth century cites
a treatise by Hermes entitled <i>De speculis et luce</i> (<i>Of mirrors
and light</i>).<a id="FNanchor_676" href="#Footnote_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a> These few instances of medieval citation of
Hermes could of course be greatly multiplied but suffice to
suggest the importance of his name in the later history of
magic and astrology as well as of alchemy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Astrological
treatises.</div>

<p>We may, however, briefly examine some specimens of
the works themselves, chiefly, as in the citations, of a magical
and astrological character, which are current under Hermes’
name in the medieval manuscripts. A treatise on fifteen
stars, fifteen stones, fifteen herbs, and fifteen images to be
engraved on the stones, is ascribed sometimes to Hermes and
sometimes to Enoch.<a id="FNanchor_677" href="#Footnote_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a> The number fifteen is difficult to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
relate to planets, signs, or decans; in fact the fifteen stars
are fixed stars supposed to exceed others in virtue. John
Gower in the fourteenth century treated of the same subject
in his <i>Confessio amantis</i>.<a id="FNanchor_678" href="#Footnote_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a> In the middle ages a <i>Centiloquium</i>,
or series of brief astrological dicta, was ascribed
to Hermes as well as to Ptolemy. Some manuscripts imply
that the <i>Centiloquium</i> of Hermes was a selection from the
astrological treatises of Hermes put together by Stephen
of Messina for Manfred, king of Sicily.<a id="FNanchor_679" href="#Footnote_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a> In a fifteenth
century manuscript is ascribed to Hermes a Latin astrological
treatise of considerable length opening with the
thirty-six decans and their astrological influence<a id="FNanchor_680" href="#Footnote_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a> but dealing
with various other matters bearing upon the prediction
of nativities; and a much briefer but equally astrological
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
work on <i>Accidents</i>, which we are told was rewritten by Haly
before it was translated into Latin.<a id="FNanchor_681" href="#Footnote_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a> Two books of “Hermes
the Philosopher” on the revolutions of nativities by some
unspecified translator were printed by H. Wolf in 1559.<a id="FNanchor_682" href="#Footnote_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a>
A work on medical diagnosis of diseases from the stars
without inspection of urine which is ascribed to Hermes in
a Wolfenbüttel manuscript<a id="FNanchor_683" href="#Footnote_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a> would probably turn out upon
examination to be the treatise on that theme of William
of England.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Of the
Six Principles
of
Things.</i></div>

<p>By the thirteenth century, if not before, a treatise was
in existence by “Hermes Mercurius Triplex” on the six principles
of things<a id="FNanchor_684" href="#Footnote_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a> with a prologue concerning the three
Mercuries,<a id="FNanchor_685" href="#Footnote_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a> of whom we have already heard Robert of
Chester speak in his preface. Here too the first is identified
with Enoch, the second with Noah, and the third is called
triplex because he was at once king, philosopher, and
prophet, ruling Egypt after the flood with supreme equity,
renowned in both the liberal and mechanical arts, and the
first to elucidate astronomy. He wrote <i>The Golden Bough</i>,
<i>Book of Longitude and Latitude</i>, <i>Book of Election</i>, <i>Canons
on the Planets</i>, and a treatise on the astrolabe. Among his
pastimes he brought to light alchemy which the philosopher
Morienus developed in his writings. <i>The Six Principles of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
Things</i> is a treatise part astronomical and part astrological,
considering the natures of the signs and the powers of the
planets in their houses. Citations of such authors as Zahel
and Dorotheus show that the work is much later than
Hermes. It is followed by four other brief treatises, of
which the first discusses time, the winds, pestilences, divination
from thunder, and eclipses of the sun and the moon;
the second and the third deal with the astrological topics,
<i>Of the triple power of the celestial bodies</i>, and <i>Of the
efficacy of medicines according to the power of the planets
and the effect of the signs</i>. The fourth treatise tells how to
use the astrolabe.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Liber
lune.</i></div>

<p>Of the books of bad necromantic images for each of the
seven planets by Hermes, which the <i>Speculum astronomiae</i>
censured, at least one seems to have been preserved for our
inspection in the manuscripts, since it has the same <i>Incipit</i>
as that cited by Albert, “<i>Probavi omnes libros</i> ...,” and
the same title, <i>Liber lune</i>,<a id="FNanchor_686" href="#Footnote_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a> or <i>Book of the Moon</i>, or, as it is
more fully described, of the twenty-eight mansions and
twenty-eight images of the moon and the fifty-four angels
who serve the images. And as Albert spoke of a treatise
of magic illusions which accompanied the seven books of
necromantic images for the planets, so this <i>Liber lune</i> is
itself also called <i>Mercury’s magic illusion</i>.<a id="FNanchor_687" href="#Footnote_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a> It probably is
the same <i>Book of Images of the Moon</i> which William of
Auvergne described as attempting to work magic by the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
names of God. The treatise opens in the usual style of
apocryphal literature by narrating how this marvelous volume
came to be discovered. After some “investigator of
wisdom and truth and friend of nature had read the volumes
of many wise men,” he found this one in a golden ark
within a silver chest which was in turn placed in a casket of
lead,&mdash;a variant on Portia’s method. He then translated it
into Arabic for the benefit of the many. Nevertheless we
have the usual caution to fear God and not show the book
to anyone nor allow any polluted man to touch it, since with
it all evils as well as all goods may be accomplished. It
tells how to engrave images as the moon passes through
each of its twenty-eight houses. The names of angels have
to be repeated seven times and suffumigations performed
seven times in the name of God the merciful and pious.
Just as the moon is nearer to us than other planets and more
efficacious, so this book, if we understand it aright, is more
precious than any other. Hermes declares that he has proved
all the books of the seven planets and not found one truer or
more perfect than this most precious portion. Balenuch,
however, a superior and most skilful philosopher, does much
of the talking for his master Hermes. The Latin text retains
the Arabic names for the mansions of the moon, the
fifty-four angels also have outlandish names, and a wood
that grows in an island in India is required in the suffumigations.
Instructions are given for engraving images which
will destroy villa, region, or town; make men dumb; restrain
sexual intercourse within a given area; heat baths
at night; congregate ten thousand birds and bees; or twist
a man’s limbs. Four special recipes are given to injure an
enemy or cause him to sicken.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hermes
on images
of the
seven
planets.</div>

<p>We shall leave until our chapter on the Pseudo-Aristotle
“The book of the spiritual works of Aristotle, or the book
<i>Antimaquis</i>, which is the book of the secrets of Hermes
... the ancient book of the seven planets.” But in at
least one manuscript the work of Hermes on the images of
the moon is accompanied by another briefer treatise
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
ascribed to him on the images of the seven planets, one for
each day of the week, to be made in the first hour of that
day which is ruled by the planet after which the day is
named. This little treatise begins with the words, “Said
Hermes, editor of this book, I have examined many sciences
of images.”<a id="FNanchor_688" href="#Footnote_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a> Altogether I have noted traces of it in four
manuscripts.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Book of
Venus</i>
of Toz.</div>

<p>In two of these manuscripts the work of Hermes on
images of the seven planets is immediately followed by a
work of Toc or Toz Graecus on the occult virtues of stones
called the Book of Venus or of the twelve stones of Venus.<a id="FNanchor_689" href="#Footnote_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a>
The first part of the treatise, however, consists of instructions,
largely astrological in character but also including use
of names of spirits and suffumigations, for casting a metal
image in the name of Venus. Astrological symbols are to
be placed on the breast, right palm, and foot of the image.</p>

<p>In the discussion of stones each paragraph opens with
the words, “Said Toz.” The use of these stones is mainly
medicinal, however, and consists usually in taking a certain
weight of the stone in question. Of astrology, spirits, and
power of words there is little more said. Some marvelous
virtues are attributed to stones nevertheless. With one, if
you secretly touch two persons who have hitherto been firm
friends, you will make them enemies “even to the end of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
the world. And if anyone grates from it the weight of one
<i>argenteus</i> and mixes it with serpent’s blood (possibly the
herb of that name) and gives it to anyone to drink, he will
flee from place to place.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Further
mentions
of Toz
Graecus.</div>

<p>Toz Graecus was cited by more than one medieval writer
and the work which we have just been describing was not
the only one that then circulated under his name, although
it seems to be cited by Daniel Morley in the twelfth century.<a id="FNanchor_690" href="#Footnote_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a>
Albertus Magnus in his list of evil books on images in the
<i>Speculum astronomiae</i> included a work on the images of
Venus,<a id="FNanchor_691" href="#Footnote_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a> another on the four mirrors of Venus, and a third
on stations for the cult of Venus. This last is also alluded
to by William of Auvergne, bishop of Paris, in his <i>De
universo</i>, and ascribed by him to “Thot grecus.”<a id="FNanchor_692" href="#Footnote_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a> There
also was once among the manuscripts of Amplonius at
Erfurt a “book of Toz Grecus containing fifty chapters on
the stations of the planets.”<a id="FNanchor_693" href="#Footnote_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a> Cecco d’Ascoli, the early
fourteenth century astrologer, mentions together “Evax
king of the Arabs and Zot grecus and Germa of Babylon.”
Which reminds one of Albert’s allusion in his theological
<i>Summa</i><a id="FNanchor_694" href="#Footnote_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a> to “the teachings of that branch of necromancy”
which treats of “images and rings and mirrors of Venus
and seals of demons,” and is expounded in the works of
Achot of Greece&mdash;who is probably our Toz Graecus, Grema
of Babylon, and Hermes the Egyptian. And again in his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
work on minerals<a id="FNanchor_695" href="#Footnote_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a> Albert lists together as authorities on
the engraving of gems with images the names of Magor
Graecus, Germa of Babylon, and Hermes the Egyptian.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Toz the
same as
Thoth or
Hermes
Trismegistus.</div>

<p>Moreover, not only is the work of Toz closely associated
both in the extant manuscripts and by Albertus Magnus
with that of Hermes, but William of Auvergne’s spelling
“Thot” shows what has perhaps already occurred to the
reader, that this Toc or Toz Graecus is no other than the
Greek equivalent of the Egyptian god Thoth; in other
words, Hermes Trismegistus himself. I have not yet mentioned
one other treatise found in a seventeenth century
manuscript, and which, while very likely a later invention,
shows at least that Toz remained a name to conjure with
down into modern times.<a id="FNanchor_696" href="#Footnote_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a> The work is called <i>A commentary
by Toz Graecus, philosopher of great name, upon the
books of Solomon to Rehoboam concerning secrets of
secrets</i>. A long preface tells how Solomon summed up all
his vast knowledge in this book for the benefit of his son
Rehoboam, and Rehoboam buried it in his tomb in an ivory
casket, and Toz after its discovery wept at his inability to
comprehend it, until it was revealed to him through an
angel of God on condition that he explain it only to the
worthy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Magic
experiments.</div>

<p>The text is full of magic experiments: experiments of
theft; experiments in invisibility; love experiments; experiments
in gaining favor; experiments in hate and destruction;
“extraordinary experiments”; “playful experiments”;
and so on. These with conjurations, characters, and
suffumigations make up the bulk of the first book. The
second book deals chiefly with “how exorcists and their allies
and disciples should conduct themselves,” and with the
varied paraphernalia required by magicians: fasts, baths,
vestments, the knife or sword, the magic circle, fumigations,
water and hyssop; light and fire, pen and ink, blood,
parchment, stylus, wax, needle, membrane, characters,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
sacrifices, and astrological images. Two of its twenty-two
chapters deal with “the places where by rights experiments
should be performed” and with “all the precepts of the arts
or experiments.” In another seventeenth century manuscript
are <i>Seven Books of Magical Experiments of Hermes
Trismegistus</i>. “And they are magic secrets of the kings of
Egypt,” drawn, we are told, from the treasury of Rudolph
II, Holy Roman emperor from 1576 to 1612.<a id="FNanchor_697" href="#Footnote_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a> Another

the same work.<a id="FNanchor_698" href="#Footnote_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a></p>

<p><a id="Footnote_656" href="#FNanchor_656" class="label">[656]</a> Berthelot (1893) I, 234, took
the date to be 1182 A. D. and so,
on the basis of this remark, placed
the introduction of Arabic alchemy
into Latin learning 38
years too late. It is rather amusing
that Lippmann, who elsewhere
avails himself of petty pretexts
to belittle the work of Berthelot,
should have overlooked this error.
He still (1919), pp. 358 and 482,
states the date as 1182 A. D., although
he is puzzled how to reconcile
it with that of 1143 A. D.
for Robertus Castrensis or Robert
de Retines. He also is at a loss
as to the identity of this Robert
or the meaning of “Castrensis,”
and has no knowledge of the publications
of Karpinski (1915) and
Haskins, EHR (1915).</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_658" href="#FNanchor_658" class="label">[658]</a> Berthelot is a poor guide in
any such matter since his pretentious
volumes on medieval alchemy
are based on the study of
a comparatively small number of
MSS at Paris. He made little or
no use of the Sloane collection in
the British Museum which is very
rich in alchemical MSS, a subject
in which Sir Hans Sloane was
apparently much interested, or of
the Ashmolean collection at Oxford,
although Elias Ashmole
edited the <i>Theatrum Chemicum
Britannicum</i>, 1652, “containing
several poetical pieces of our
famous English philosophers who
have written the hermetic mysteries
in their own ancient language,”&mdash;a
work in which Ashmole
himself is called <i>Mercuriophilus
Anglicus</i>.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_659" href="#FNanchor_659" class="label">[659]</a> The two earliest MSS used
by Berthelot for medieval Latin
alchemy were BN 6514 and 7156
of the late 13th or early 14th century.
In an earlier chapter we
have mentioned Berlin 956 of the
12th century, fol. 21, “Hic incipit
alchamia,” and probably a fairly
long list could be made of alchemical
MSS of the 13th century,
like Digby 162 mentioned in
a previous note to this chapter.
However, as a rule the numerous
alchemical collections in the
Sloane MSS&mdash;a majority of the
MSS numbered from about 3600
to about 3900 are in whole or
part concerned with alchemy, as
well as a number of earlier numbers&mdash;are
not earlier than the 14th
and 15th centuries, and many are
subsequent to the invention of
printing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Question
of the
origin of
the work.</div>

<p>The virtues, especially medicinal, of plants and animals
comprise the contents of a work in Latin of uncertain date
and authorship, usually called the <i>Kiranides</i> of Kiranus,
King of Persia.<a id="FNanchor_699" href="#Footnote_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a> Thomas Browne, in his <i>Pseudodoxia Epidemica</i>
or <i>Inquiry into Vulgar Errors</i>, included in his list
of “authors who have most promoted popular conceits,
... <i>Kiranides</i>, which is a collection out of Harpocration
the Greek and sundry Arabick writers delivering not only
the Naturall but Magicall propriety of things, a work as
full of vanity as variety, containing many relations, whose
invention is as difficult as their beliefs, and their experiments
sometime as hard as either.”<a id="FNanchor_700" href="#Footnote_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a> The work purports
to be a translation from the Greek version which in its
turn was from the Arabic,<a id="FNanchor_701" href="#Footnote_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a> and Berthelot affirms<a id="FNanchor_702" href="#Footnote_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a> that in
antiquity <i>Kiranides</i> was cited by Galen and by Olympiodorus,
the historian and alchemist of the early fifth century,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
while Kroll cites a Greek manuscript at Paris as ascribing
the third book of <i>Kiranides</i> to Hermes Trismegistus.<a id="FNanchor_703" href="#Footnote_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Its
prefaces.</div>

<p>The preface of the medieval Latin translator is by “a
lowly cleric” who addresses some ecclesiastical or scholastic
superior, possibly the Chancellor at Paris.<a id="FNanchor_704" href="#Footnote_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a> He marvels
that the mind of his patron, which has penetrated beyond
the seven heavens to contemplate supernatural things above
our sphere, should nevertheless not disdain an interest in
the most lowly of terrene “experiments.” The master has
asked him to translate this medical book from Greek into
Latin, a task easier to ask than to execute. There are several
Greek versions of it, all professedly translations from
some oriental original, but the volume which his patron
gave him to translate into Latin is that translated into Greek
at Constantinople in 1168<a id="FNanchor_705" href="#Footnote_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a> or 1169<a id="FNanchor_706" href="#Footnote_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a> by order of the
Byzantine emperor, Manuel Comnenus, whom we shall also
find associated with the <i>Letter of Prester John</i> of which we
shall treat in the next chapter. The translator speaks
of the work as <i>The Book of Natural Virtues, Complaints,
and Cures</i>, but adds that it is a compilation from
two other books, namely, <i>The Experience of the Kiranides
of Kiranus, King of Persia</i>, and <i>The Book of Harpocration<a id="FNanchor_707" href="#Footnote_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a>
of Alexandria to his Daughter</i>. There then follows
the preface of Harpocration to his daughter, which tells of
a certain city and of encountering an aged sage there, of
great towers and of precious writing on a column which
Harpocration proceeds to transcribe. We are given to understand
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
that the original was written in “antique archaic
Syriac” and was as old as the Euphrates.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Arrangement
of
the text.</div>

<p>The text is divided into four books, each arranged alphabetically.
The first book subdivides into “Elements.” For
example, <i>Elementum XII</i> is devoted to a tree, a bird, a stone,
and a fish, each of which begins with the letter M. Most,
however, of the virtues and medicinal prescriptions which
follow have to do with the tree or herb only. The second
book treats of beasts or quadrupeds, the third of birds, and
the fourth of fish.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Virtues
of a tree.</div>

<p>Much superstition and magical procedure is found scattered
through, or better, crowded into, the book. For instance,
in a medicinal application of the cyme of the tree
Μορέα, one is to face the southwest wind, use two fingers
of the left hand to remove the cyme, then look behind one
toward the east, wrap the cyme in purple or red silk (<i>vera?</i>),
and touch the patient with it or bind it about her. In another
recipe the fruit of this tree is to be compounded in
varying proportions with such substances as an Indian stone
and the tips of the wings of crows and is then to be stirred
with a crow’s feather until the mixture is “soft and sticky.”
In a third prescription a stone engraved with an image of
the fish mentioned under the letter M&mdash;μόρμυρος, and enclosed
in an iron box, is to be combined with the “eyes”
(buds?) of the tree <i>Morea</i> as an amulet against certain
ills.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Feats of
magic.</div>

<p>In some cases the end sought as well as the procedure
employed is magical rather than medicinal. In another
chapter of the first book, for example, the reader is instructed
how to make a <i>licinium</i> or combustible compound in
whose light those present will appear to one another like
flaming demons. Or in book two the reader is told that
wearing the dried tongue of a weasel inside his socks will
close the mouths of his enemies. The weasel’s testicles,
right and left, are used as charms to stimulate and prevent
conception respectively.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">An incantation
to
an eagle.</div>

<p>Incantations are employed in connection with the eagle,
the first of forty-four birds taken up in the third book.
Catch one, collect the dung it makes during the first day and
night of its captivity, then bind its feet and beak and whisper
in its ear, “Oh, eagle, friend of man, I am about to slay
you for the cure of every infirmity. I conjure you by the
God of earth and sky and by the four elements that you
efficaciously work each and every cure for which you are
oblated.” The eagle is then decapitated with a sword composed
entirely of iron, all its blood is carefully caught in a
bowl, its heart and entrails are removed and placed in wine,
and other directions observed. The discussion of the virtues
of fish in the fourth and last book is essentially identical in
character with the examples already given for plants, birds,
and beasts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Alchiranus.</div>

<p>In a sixteenth century manuscript at Venice<a id="FNanchor_708" href="#Footnote_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a> is a Latin
version which would seem to be translated from the Arabic
since it gives the author’s name as Alchiranus, although
some scholiast has interpolated and added to the words of
this author and of Harpocration. As described by Valentinelli
the arrangement into books is the same as that which
we have noted. Valentinelli also was impressed by the fact
that “medical substances are used to produce not merely
physical but moral effects, such as prescience of the
future, dispelling demons and evil phantoms, avoiding shipwreck
by binding the heart of a <i>foca</i> to the mast of the
vessel; discovering what sort of life a woman has led, becoming
invisible, averting storms, perils, wild beasts, robbers.”
And further that “the efficacy of the medicaments
is dependent upon their mode of preparation or application,
at the rising or setting of the sun, at the waning or waxing
of the moon, by uttering certain words or engraving
stones.”<a id="FNanchor_709" href="#Footnote_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span></p><div class="sidenote">Treatises
on seven,
twelve,
and nineteen
herbs.</div>

<p>The Latin translator of the Kiranides says that it should
be preceded by the book of Alexander the Great concerning
seven herbs and the seven planets, and by the Mystery of
Thessalus to Hermes about twelve herbs for the twelve
signs of the zodiac and seven herbs for the seven stars. And
in what is left of the preface to the latter treatise in an
Erfurt manuscript we are told that after discovering the
volumes of the Kyranides the writer found also in the city
of Troy the present treatise enclosed in a monument along
with the bones of the first king named Kyrannis.<a id="FNanchor_710" href="#Footnote_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a> The first
treatise on seven herbs, however, seems to be more often
ascribed in the manuscripts to an Alexius Affricus<a id="FNanchor_711" href="#Footnote_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a> or
Flaccus Africanus<a id="FNanchor_712" href="#Footnote_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a> than to Alexander the Great.<a id="FNanchor_713" href="#Footnote_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a> Alexius
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
or Flaccus seems to address his work to a Claudius or Glandiger
of Athens. The work of Thessalus, whose name is
sometimes corrupted to Tesalus or Texilus, and whose work
is variously styled of twelve or of nineteen herbs, usually
is found with the other treatise in the manuscripts.<a id="FNanchor_714" href="#Footnote_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a> It was
one of the authorities acknowledged by Jacobus de Dondis
in his <i>Aggregatio Medicamentorum</i>, written in 1355.<a id="FNanchor_715" href="#Footnote_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a> The
treatise on seven herbs of Alexander or Flaccus Africanus
closes with the direction that the herbs should be gathered
from the twenty-first to twenty-seventh day of the moon,
with Mercury rising during the entire first hour of the day.
As they are plucked, the passion of our Lord should be
mentioned, and they should be preserved in barley or wheat.
But one manuscript adds, “But do not put credulity in them
beyond due measure.”<a id="FNanchor_716" href="#Footnote_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a> We have, of course, already met
with similar treatises ascribed to Enoch and Hermes.<a id="FNanchor_717" href="#Footnote_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Belenus.</div>

<p>The Belenus, as whose disciple Flaccus Africanus is
represented, is also the reputed author of a work on astrological
images found in several manuscripts of the British
Museum.<a id="FNanchor_718" href="#Footnote_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a> Albertus Magnus in the <i>Speculum astronomiae</i>
attributed to Belenus two reprehensible books of necromantic
images.<a id="FNanchor_719" href="#Footnote_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a> The <i>Turba philosophorum</i>, a medieval
work of alchemy consisting in large measure of Latin re-translation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
of Arabic versions from Greek alchemists, also
cites a Belus or Belinus. The name is believed to be a
corruption from Apollonius of Tyana, with whom Apollonius
of Perga, the mathematician, is perhaps also confused.<a id="FNanchor_720" href="#Footnote_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a>
One of the <i>Incipits</i> of the tracts listed in the
<i>Speculum astronomiae</i> is, “Said Belenus who is also called
Apollo.” However, many medieval Latin manuscripts attribute
works to Apollonius under that name, as in the case
of a work on the Notory Art which we shall mention in another
chapter.<a id="FNanchor_721" href="#Footnote_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a></p>

The translator’s address to
his patron sounds a little like
Hugh of Santalla, but a date after
1168 is rather late either for Hugh
or the anonymous Sicilian translator
of the Almagest, whom the
association in this case with Paris
also tends to preclude. Possibly
the translator may be Philip, the

<p>Medieval notions of the marvels of India&mdash;India’s real contribution

Thomas&mdash;Otto of Freising on Prester John&mdash;Prester John’s letter to

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Medieval
notions of
the marvels
of
India.</div>

<p>In a twelfth century manuscript at Berlin a treatise on precious
stones and their medicinal and other marvelous virtues
which is ascribed to St. Jerome,<a id="FNanchor_722" href="#Footnote_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a> opens with a prologue describing
a voyage to India, the home of the carbuncle,
emerald, and other gems, and the land of mountains of gold
guarded by dragons, griffins, and other monsters. According
to this prologue the navigation of the Red Sea is extremely
dangerous and takes six months, while another full year is
required to cross the ocean to India and the Ganges.</p>

<p>India was still a distant land of wonders and home of
magic to the minds of medieval men, as it had been in the
<i>Life of Apollonius of Tyana</i>, and as even to-day many
westerners are credulous concerning its jugglers, fakirs,
yogis, and theosophists. So William of Auvergne, bishop
of Paris, writing in the first half of the thirteenth century,
states that feats of magic are very seldom wrought in the
Europe of his time. For one thing, as Origen and other
early church fathers had already explained, the demons
since the coming of Christ to earth had largely ceased their
magical activities in Christian lands. But another reason
was that the materials for working natural magic, the gems
and herbs and animals with marvelous virtues, were seldom
found in European lands. In India and other countries
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
adjacent to it, on the contrary, such materials were abundant.
Hence natural magic still flourished there and it
was a land of many experimenters and of skilful marvel-workers.<a id="FNanchor_723" href="#Footnote_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a>
Similarly Albertus Magnus, discussing the marvelous
powers of astrological images, states that the best
gems upon which to engrave them are those from India.<a id="FNanchor_724" href="#Footnote_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a>
Costa ben Luca says in his work on physical ligatures that
doctors in India are firm believers in the efficacy of incantations
and adjurations; and about 1295 Peter of Abano
speaks in his <i>Phisionomia</i> of the wise men of India as prolix
on astrological themes. Medieval geomancies, too, often
claim a connection with India.<a id="FNanchor_725" href="#Footnote_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">India’s
real contribution
to knowledge.</div>

<p>It should also be kept in mind, however, that medieval
men believed that they derived from India learning which
seems to us even to-day as sound and useful as it did to them
then; for example, the Hindu-Arabic numerals.<a id="FNanchor_726" href="#Footnote_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a> Leonardo
of Pisa, the great arithmetician of the early thirteenth century,
tells us in the preface to his <i>Liber Abaci</i><a id="FNanchor_727" href="#Footnote_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a> how, summoned
as a boy to join his father who was a customs official
at a trading station in Algeria, he was introduced to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
the art of reckoning “by a marvelous method through the
nine figures of the Indians.” Thus we see that India’s
marvels were not always false. Later he traveled in Egypt,
Syria, Greece, Sicily, and Provence and studied their various
methods of reckoning, but vastly preferred the Indian
method to all others, returned to a more intensive study of
it, and developed it further by additions from Euclid and
contributions of his own. Not always, it is true, were
medieval mathematicians as favorable to Indian methods as
this. Jordanus Nemorarius in one passage characterizes
an Indian theorem as “nothing but mere credulity without
demonstration.”<a id="FNanchor_728" href="#Footnote_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a> But to return to the natural marvels of
India.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
legend of
Prester
John.</div>

<p>In the extraordinary accounts of Prester John,<a id="FNanchor_729" href="#Footnote_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a> which
are first met in the twelfth century and were added to with
succeeding centuries and which had great currency from
the start, as the number of extant manuscripts shows, the
natural marvels of India vie in impressiveness and wonderment
with the power of Prester John himself and with the
miracles of the Apostle Thomas.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Miracles
of the
Apostle
Thomas.</div>

<p>Odo, Abbot of St. Rémy from 1118 to 1151, states in a
letter in response to the inquiry of a Count Thomas what
had happened when he was recently in Rome. Byzantine
ambassadors introduced to the pope an archbishop of
India who had already had the extraordinary and disconcerting
experience of having to return a third time to Constantinople
for a new prince for his country, each previous
Byzantine nominee having died on his hands. This archbishop
said that the body of the Apostle Thomas was preserved
in his country in a church rich in treasure and ornaments
and surrounded by a river fordable only at the time
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
of the saint’s festival. On that solemn occasion the
Apostle’s body was shown to believers and the Apostle would
raise his arm and open his hand to receive their gifts, but
close it and refuse to receive any gift offered by a heretic.
When this tale reached the pope’s ears he forbade the archbishop
to disseminate such falsehoods further under pain
of anathema, but the archbishop finally convinced the pope
by taking an oath on the holy gospels.</p>

<p>Another longer and anonymous account has come down
from manuscripts going back to the twelfth century of the
visit of a Patriarch John of India to Rome under Pope
Calixtus II (1119-1124). It is this account which is often
joined in the manuscripts and early printed editions with
the <i>Letter of Prester John</i> of which we shall presently
speak. In this account the Patriarch John told “of memorable
matters of his Indian region that were unknown to
the Romans,” such as of the gold and gems in the river
Physon which flows from Paradise, “but especially of the
miracles of the most holy Apostle Thomas.” Without
going into further details, such as that of the miraculous
balsam lamp, which differ a good deal from Odo’s account,
it may be noted that in this account the Apostle’s hand
ministers the Eucharist to believers and refuses it to infidels
and sinners.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Otto of
Freising
on Prester
John, the
descendant
of the
Magi.</div>

<p>We have progressed from an archbishop of India to a
Patriarch John; we now come to Prester John the monarch.
The historian, Otto of Freising, learned in 1145 from a
Syrian bishop at Rome of a great victory recently gained
over the Moslems by “a certain John who lived beyond
Persia and Armenia in the extreme East, a king and priest,
since he was a Christian by race but a Nestorian ...
Prester John, for so they are wont to call him.” He was
of the ancient progeny of the Magi mentioned in the Gospel,
ruled the same races as they, and enjoyed such glory and
abundance that he was said to use only an emerald scepter.
After his victory he would have come to the aid of the
crusaders at Jerusalem, but could not cross the Tigris, although
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
he marched north along its eastern bank and waited
for some years in the hope that it would freeze over.<a id="FNanchor_730" href="#Footnote_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Prester
John’s letter
to the
Emperor
Manuel.</div>

<p>This Prester John was to be heard from again, however,
for in the same century there appeared a letter purporting
to have been written by him to the Byzantine Emperor,
Manuel (1143-1180).<a id="FNanchor_731" href="#Footnote_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a> It is in this letter that the natural
and artificial marvels of India and adjacent territories&mdash;Prester
John’s dominion reaches from farther India to the
Babylonian desert&mdash;are especially recorded. This letter
even in its earliest and briefest form seems without doubt a
western forgery and bears the marks of its Latin origin,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span><a id="FNanchor_732" href="#Footnote_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a>
since despite the use of a few Greek ecclesiastical and official
terms<a id="FNanchor_733" href="#Footnote_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a> and the attempt to rehearse unheard-of wonders, the
writer indulges in a sneer at Greek adoration of the emperor<a id="FNanchor_734" href="#Footnote_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a>
and is unable to conceive of Prester John except as
a feudal overlord<a id="FNanchor_735" href="#Footnote_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a> with the usual kings, dukes and counts,
archbishops, bishops and abbots under him. The letter then
is of value chiefly as showing us what ideas prevailed concerning
India and the orient in the Latin world of the
twelfth and succeeding centuries, for the letter received
many additions and variations, was translated into the
vernacular languages, and appeared in print before 1500.<a id="FNanchor_736" href="#Footnote_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a>
In the following account of its contents, however, I shall
try to describe the letter as it existed in the twelfth century,
after which I shall mention what seem to be interpolations
of the thirteenth or later centuries.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Marvels
recounted
by Prester
John.</div>

<p>But while different copies of the work vary, all have
the same general character. Prester John tells what a
mighty and Christian potentate he is and describes his marvelous
palaces and contrivances or the natural marvels,
strange beasts and serpents, monstrous races of men, potent
herbs, stones, and fountains, to be found in the lands owning
his sway. In one province is the herb <i>assidios</i> which enables
its bearer to rout an impure spirit and force him to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
disclose his name and whence he comes. “Wherefore impure
spirits in that land dare not take possession of anyone.”<a id="FNanchor_737" href="#Footnote_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a>
A fountain flows from Mount Olympus not three
days’ journey from Paradise whence Adam was expelled.
Three draughts from it taken fasting insure one henceforth
from all infirmity, and however long one may live, one will
seem henceforth but thirty years of age.<a id="FNanchor_738" href="#Footnote_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a> Then there are
some little stones which eagles often bring to Prester John’s
territories and which worn on the finger preserve or restore
the sight, or if consecrated with a lawful incantation, make
one invisible and dispel envy and hatred and promote concord.<a id="FNanchor_739" href="#Footnote_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a>
After a description of a sea of sand in which there
are various kinds of edible fish and a river of stones, Prester
John soon mentions the worms which in his language are
called salamanders, who cannot live except in fire, and from
whose skins he has robes made which can be cleansed only
by fire.<a id="FNanchor_740" href="#Footnote_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a> After some boasting concerning the absence of
poverty, crime, and falsehood in his country and about the
pomp and wealth with which he goes forth to war, Prester
John then comes to the description of his palace, which is
similar to that which the Apostle Thomas built for Gundaphorus,
King of India. Its gates of sardonyx mixed with
<i>cornu cerastis</i> (horn of the horned serpents) prevent the
secret introduction of poison; a couch of sapphire keeps
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
John chaste; the square before the palace where judicial
duels are held is paved with onyx “in order that the courage
of the fighters may be increased by the virtue of the stone.”<a id="FNanchor_741" href="#Footnote_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a>
Near this square is a magic mirror which reveals all plots
in the provinces subject to Prester John or in adjacent
lands.<a id="FNanchor_742" href="#Footnote_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a> In some manuscripts of the twelfth century is a
description of another palace which before Prester John’s
birth his father was instructed in a dream to build for his
son. One feature of it is that no matter how hungry one
may be on entering it, he always comes out feeling as full
as if he had partaken of a sumptuous banquet.<a id="FNanchor_743" href="#Footnote_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Additional
marvels in
later
versions.</div>

<p>To such marvels in the early versions of the <i>Letter of
Prester John</i> were added others in the course of the thirteenth
century and later middle ages:&mdash;the huge man-eating
ants who mined gold by night;<a id="FNanchor_744" href="#Footnote_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a> the land where men lived
on manna, a substance which we shall find somewhat
similarly mentioned by Michael Scot and Thomas of
Cantimpré;<a id="FNanchor_745" href="#Footnote_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a> the tale, which we shall also hear from Roger
Bacon, of men who tame flying dragons by their incantations
and magic, saddle and bridle them, and ride them through
the air;<a id="FNanchor_746" href="#Footnote_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a> the five marvelous stones that froze or heated or
reduced to an even state of temperature or made light or
dark everything within a radius of five miles; the second
five stones, of which two were unconsecrated and turned
water to milk or wine, while three were consecrated and
would respectively cause fish to congregate, wild beasts to
follow one, and, sprinkled with hot lion’s blood, produce a
conflagration which could only be quenched by sprinkling
the stone with hot dragon’s blood;<a id="FNanchor_747" href="#Footnote_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a> the marvelous mill
operated by the occult virtue of the stone adamant;<a id="FNanchor_748" href="#Footnote_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a> the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
wonderful tree on which the wonderful healing apple grew;<a id="FNanchor_749" href="#Footnote_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a>
the marvelous chapel of glass, always just big enough for as
many persons as entered it;<a id="FNanchor_750" href="#Footnote_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a> and the stone and the fountain
that served as fireless heaters.<a id="FNanchor_751" href="#Footnote_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a> In another case a
marvel is wrought by stone and fountain combined. Two
old men guard a large stone and admit to its hollow only
Christians or those who desire to become Christians. If
this profession of faith is genuine, the water in the hollow
which is usually only four fingers deep thrice rises above
the head of the person admitted, who thereupon emerges
recovered from all sickness.<a id="FNanchor_752" href="#Footnote_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The letter
of Pope
Alexander
III.</div>

<p>How real Prester John was to the men of the twelfth
century may be seen from the fact that Pope Alexander III
on September 27, 1177, addressed from the Rialto in Venice
a letter to him or to some actual eastern potentate whom he
had confused with him.<a id="FNanchor_753" href="#Footnote_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a> The Pope does not expressly mention
Prester John’s letter to Manuel but says that he has
heard of him from many persons and common report, and
more especially from “Master Philip, our friend and physician,”
who had talked “with great and honourable men of
your kingdom,” by whom he had been informed of their
ruler’s desire for a church and altar at Jerusalem. It is this
Philip whom the Pope now sends with his letter to Prester
John and to instruct him in the doctrine of the Roman
church. But it is a long and laborious journey involving
many hardships and vicissitudes and the traversing of many
countries with barbarous and unknown languages.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Philip,
the papal
physician.</div>

<p>Whether Philip ever succeeded in delivering the letter
is not known and he has himself been regarded as a mysterious
personage of whom nothing further was known.<a id="FNanchor_754" href="#Footnote_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a>
I would suggest, however, that, as he seems to have been
conversant with Syria and the Holy Land, he may have
been the Philip of whose translation of the <i>Secret of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
Secrets</i> of the Pseudo-Aristotle we shall treat in the next
chapter, a work which he found in Antioch and dedicated
to the bishop of Tripoli. Or, if we do not meet this particular
Philip again, we shall find in close relations with
other popes other physicians whose names are prominent in
the natural and occult science of the age.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_730" href="#FNanchor_730" class="label">[730]</a> In Yule (1903) I, 231-7, Cordier
discusses whether this monarch
was Gurkhan of Kara Khitai
(as urged by d’Avezac and Oppert)
who “in 1141 came to the
aid of the King of Khwarizmi
against Sanjar, the Seljukian sovereign
of Persia, ... and defeated
that prince with great
slaughter,” or whether he was
“John Orbelian ... for years the

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_731" href="#FNanchor_731" class="label">[731]</a> For its text, with interpolations
distinguished from the original
text, see Zarncke (1879) 909-924.
Some of the passages which
Zarncke regards as interpolations
are, however, already found in
12th century MSS. On the
other hand, his text does not include
all the interpolations and
variations to be found even in the
MSS which he describes. For
instance, in BN 6244A, fol. 130r,
just before the description of the
herb <i>assidios</i>, occurs a passage
which may be translated as follows:
“You should know also
that in our country we do not need
doctors, for we have precious
stones, herbs, fountains, and trees
of so great virtue that they prevail
against every infirmity and
against poisons and wounds. And
we have books which instruct us
and distinguish between the potencies
and virtues of the herbs.”
In this MS Prester John is also
more voluble on the theme of his
devotion to the Christian faith
than appears in Zarncke’s text,
and (fols. 127v-128r) repeats the
story of the administration of
the Eucharist by the hand of the
body of the Apostle Thomas.
Zarncke lists about one hundred
MSS of the letter but fails to
use or mention any of those in
the Bodleian Library where, for
instance, Digby 158, fols. 2r-5v, is
of the twelfth century. Another
twelfth century MS not in his
list is Paris Arsenal 379A, fol.
34. Zarncke also does not list the
MSS of the letter at Madrid
and Wolfenbüttel.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_732" href="#FNanchor_732" class="label">[732]</a> In many MSS. nothing is said
of its being a translation or when
or by whom it was translated;
others state that it was translated
into Greek and Latin, or, in at
least one case, from Arabic into
Latin. Only from the thirteenth
century on, I think, is Christian,
Archbishop of Mainz, sometimes
said to have translated it from
Greek into Latin. Often it is
simply stated that Manuel transmitted
the letter to the Emperor
Frederick, to whom also it is
sometimes represented as sent
direct by Prester John. Sometimes
it is to the Pope to whom
the letter comes from Manuel
or Prester John.</p>

<p>The statement that Manuel
transmitted the letter to the Emperor
Frederick makes one wonder
whether Anselm, Bishop of
Havelberg and later of Ravenna,
can have had anything to do with
it. He was sent by Frederick
on an embassy to Manuel in 1153,
which seems to identify him with
the author of a “<i>Liber de diversitate
nature et persone proprietatumque
personalium non tam
Latinorum quam ex Grecorum
auctoritatibus extractus</i>”&mdash;CUL
1824 (Qi. vi. 27), beautiful 13th
century hand, fols. 129-76,&mdash;who
states in his preface that he collected
his Greek authorities in
Constantinople where he was sent
by Frederick on an embassy to

<div class="sidenote">Alexander
and Aristotle.</div>

<p>In a previous chapter we have seen what a wide currency
the legend of Alexander had both in east and west in the
later Roman Empire and early middle ages, and how with
Alexander was associated the magician and astrologer
Nectanebus. We also saw that by about 800 A. D. at least
a separate Letter of Alexander to Aristotle on the Marvels
of India was current in the Latin west, and in the present
chapter it is especially to the Pseudo-Aristotle and his connection
with Alexander and India, rather than to the Pseudo-Callisthenes,
that we turn. The tremendous historical importance
of the career of Alexander the Great and of the
writings of Aristotle impressed itself perhaps even unduly
upon both the Arabian and the medieval mind. The personal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
connection between the two men&mdash;Aristotle was for
a time Alexander’s tutor&mdash;was seized upon and magnified.
Pliny in his <i>Natural History</i> had stated that Alexander had
empowered Aristotle to send two thousand men to different
parts of the world to test by experience all things on the
face of the earth.<a id="FNanchor_755" href="#Footnote_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a> This account of their scientific co-operation
was enlarged upon by spurious writings associated
with their names like the letter on the marvels of India.<a id="FNanchor_756" href="#Footnote_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a>
With the introduction into western Europe in the twelfth
and early thirteenth centuries of many genuine works of
Aristotle unknown to the early middle ages, which had
possessed only certain of his logical treatises, there also
came into circulation a number of spurious writings ascribed
to him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Spurious
writings
ascribed
to Aristotle.</div>

<p>It is not surprising that many spurious works were
attributed to Aristotle in the middle ages, when we remember
that his writings came to them for the most part indirectly
through corrupt translations, and that some writing
from so great a master was eagerly looked for upon every
subject in which they were interested. It seemed to them
that so encyclopedic a genius must have touched on all
fields of knowledge and they often failed to realize that in
Aristotle’s time the departments of learning had been somewhat
different from their own and that new interests and
doctrine had developed since then. There was also a
tendency to ascribe to Aristotle any work of unknown or
uncertain authorship. At the close of the twelfth century
Alexander Neckam<a id="FNanchor_757" href="#Footnote_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a> lists among historic instances of envy
Aristotle’s holding back from posterity certain of his most
subtle writings, which he ordered should be buried with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
him. At the same time he so guarded the place of his
sepulcher, whether by some force of nature or power of art
or prodigy of magic is uncertain, that no one has yet been
able to approach it, although some think that Antichrist
will be able to inspect these books when he comes. Roger
Bacon in the thirteenth century believed that Aristotle had
written over a thousand works and complained bitterly
because certain treatises, which were probably really
apocryphal, had not been translated into Latin.<a id="FNanchor_758" href="#Footnote_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a> Indeed,
some of the works ascribed to Aristotle in the Oriental and
Mohammedan worlds were never translated into Latin, such
as the astrological <i>De impressionibus coelestibus</i> which
Bacon mentions, or the Syriac text which K. Ahrens edited
in 1892 with a German translation as “Das Buch der
Naturgegenstände”; or first appeared in Latin guise after
the invention of printing, as was the case with the so-called
<i>Theology</i> of Aristotle,<a id="FNanchor_759" href="#Footnote_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a> a work which was little more than
a series of extracts from the <i>Enneads</i> of Plotinus.<a id="FNanchor_760" href="#Footnote_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a> Some
treatises attributed to Aristotle in medieval Latin do not bear
especially upon our investigation, such as <i>Grammar</i> which
Grosseteste is said to have translated from Greek.<a id="FNanchor_761" href="#Footnote_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span></p><div class="sidenote">Aristotle
and experiment.</div>

<p>For our purposes the Pseudo-Aristotelian writings
may be sub-divided under seven heads: experiment,
alchemy, astrology, spirits, occult virtues of stones and
herbs, chiromancy and physiognomy, and last the famous
<i>Secret of Secrets</i>. Under the first of these heads may
be put a treatise on the conduct of waters, which consists
of a series of experiments in siphoning and the like illustrated
in the manuscript by lettered and colored figures and
diagrams.<a id="FNanchor_762" href="#Footnote_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a> In a Vatican manuscript it is perhaps more
correctly ascribed to Philo of Byzantium.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Aristotle
and
alchemy:
<i>Meteorology</i>
and
<i>On colors</i>.</div>

<p>From experiment to alchemy is an easy step, for the
alchemists experimented a good deal in the period which we
are now considering. The fourth book of the <i>Meteorology</i>
of Aristotle, which, if not a genuine portion of that work,
at least goes back to the third century before Christ,<a id="FNanchor_763" href="#Footnote_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a> has
been called a manual of chemistry,<a id="FNanchor_764" href="#Footnote_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a> and apparently is the
oldest such extant. Its doctrines are also believed to have
been influential in the development of alchemy; and there
were passages in this fourth book which led men later to
regard Aristotle as favorable to the doctrine of the transmutation
of metals. Gerard of Cremona had translated only
the first three books of the <i>Meteorology</i>; the fourth was
supplied from a translation from the Greek made by
Henricus Aristippus who died in 1162; to this fourth
book were added three chapters translated by Alfred of England
or of Sareshel from the Arabic,<a id="FNanchor_765" href="#Footnote_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a> apparently of Avicenna.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span><a id="FNanchor_766" href="#Footnote_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a>
These additions of Alfred from Avicenna discussed
the formation of metals but attacked the alchemists.<a id="FNanchor_767" href="#Footnote_767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a> Vincent
of Beauvais<a id="FNanchor_768" href="#Footnote_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a> and Albertus Magnus<a id="FNanchor_769" href="#Footnote_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a> were both aware,
however, that this attack upon the alchemists was probably
not by Aristotle. The short treatise <i>On colors</i>,<a id="FNanchor_770" href="#Footnote_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a> which is included
in so many medieval manuscript collections of the
works of Aristotle in Latin,<a id="FNanchor_771" href="#Footnote_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a> by its very title would suggest
to medieval readers that he had been interested in the art of
alchemy, although its actual contents deal only in small part
with dyes and tinctures. Its form and contents are not regarded
as Aristotle’s, but it was perhaps by someone of the
Peripatetic school. Thus works which, if not by Aristotle
himself, at least had been written in Greek long before the
medieval period, gave medieval readers the impression that
Aristotle was favorable to alchemy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span></p><div class="sidenote">Works of
alchemy
ascribed
to Aristotle.</div>

<p>It is therefore not surprising that works of alchemy appeared
in medieval Latin under Aristotle’s name. The
names of Plato and Aristotle had headed the lists of alchemists
in Greek manuscripts although no works ascribed to
Aristotle have been preserved in the same.<a id="FNanchor_772" href="#Footnote_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a> Berthelot, however,
speaks of a pseudo-Aristotle in Arabic,<a id="FNanchor_773" href="#Footnote_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a> and in an Oxford
manuscript of the thirteenth century under the name
of Aristotle appears a treatise <i>On the twelve waters of the
secret river</i> said to be “translated from Arabic into Latin.”<a id="FNanchor_774" href="#Footnote_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a>
In the preface the author promises that whoever becomes
skilled, adept, and expert in these twelve waters will never
lose hope nor be depressed by want. He regards this treatise
as the chief among his works, since he has learned these waters
by experiment. They are all chemical rather than
medical; a brief “chapter” or paragraph is devoted to each.
In another manuscript at the Bodleian two brief tracts are
ascribed to Aristotle; one describes the seven metals, the
other deals with transmutation.<a id="FNanchor_775" href="#Footnote_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a> In a single manuscript at
Munich both a theoretical treatise in medicine and alchemy
and a <i>Practica</i> are attributed to Aristotle, and in two other
manuscripts he is credited with the <i>Book of Seventy Precepts</i>
which sometimes is ascribed to Geber.<a id="FNanchor_776" href="#Footnote_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a> Thomas of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
Cantimpré cites Aristotle in the <i>Lumen luminum</i> as saying
that the best gold is made from yellow copper ore and the
urine of a boy, but Thomas hastens to add that such gold is
best in color rather than in substance.<a id="FNanchor_777" href="#Footnote_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a> The translation of
the <i>Lumen luminum</i> is ascribed both to Michael Scot and
brother Elias.<a id="FNanchor_778" href="#Footnote_778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a> Aristotle is quoted several times in <i>De alchimia</i>,
ascribed to Albertus Magnus, but only in the later
“Additions” to it, where Roger Bacon also is cited, is the
specific title <i>Liber de perfecto magisterio</i> given as Aristotle’s.<a id="FNanchor_779" href="#Footnote_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a>
Sometimes works of alchemy were very carelessly
ascribed to Aristotle, when it is perfectly evident from the
works themselves that they could not have been written by
him.<a id="FNanchor_780" href="#Footnote_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Aristotle
and Alexander
as
alchemists.</div>

<p>The alchemical discoveries and writings ascribed to Aristotle
are often associated in some way with Alexander the
Great as well. In one manuscript John of Spain’s translation
of the <i>Secret of Secrets</i> is followed by a description of
the virtues and compositions of four stones “which Aristotle
sent to Alexander the Great.”<a id="FNanchor_781" href="#Footnote_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a> It seems obvious that
these are philosopher’s stones and not natural gems. The
<i>Liber ignium</i> of Marcus Grecus, composed in the thirteenth
or early fourteenth century, ascribes to Aristotle the discovery
of two marvelous kinds of fires. One, which he discovered
while traveling with Alexander the king, will burn
for a year without cessation. The other, in the composition
of which observance of the dog-days is requisite, “Aristotle
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
asserts will last for nine years.”<a id="FNanchor_782" href="#Footnote_782" class="fnanchor">[782]</a> A collection of chemical
experiments by a Nicholas, of whom we shall have more to
say in a later chapter, gives “a fire which Aristotle discovered
with Alexander for obscure places.”<a id="FNanchor_783" href="#Footnote_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a> A letter of
Aristotle to Alexander in a collection of alchemical tracts
is hardly worth noting, as it is only seven lines long, but it
is interesting to observe that it cites Aristotle’s <i>Meteorology</i>.<a id="FNanchor_784" href="#Footnote_784" class="fnanchor">[784]</a>
Perhaps by a mistake one or two alchemical treatises
are ascribed to Alexander rather than Aristotle.<a id="FNanchor_785" href="#Footnote_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Aristotle
and
astrology.</div>

<p>Aristotle’s genuine works give even more encouragement
to the pretensions of astrology than to those of alchemy.
His opinion that the four elements were insufficient
to explain natural phenomena and his theory of a fifth
essence were favorable to the belief in occult virtue and the
influence of the stars upon inferior objects. In his work on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
generation<a id="FNanchor_786" href="#Footnote_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a> he held that the elements alone were mere tools
without a workman; the missing agent is supplied by the
revolution of the heavens. In the twelfth book of the
<i>Metaphysics</i> he described the stars and planets as eternal
and acting as intermediaries between the prime Mover and
inferior beings. Thus they are the direct causes of all life
and action in our world. Charles Jourdain regarded the
introduction of the <i>Metaphysics</i> into western Europe at the
opening of the thirteenth century as a principal cause for the
great prevalence of astrology from that time on, the other
main cause being the translation of Arabian astrological
treatises.<a id="FNanchor_787" href="#Footnote_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a> Jourdain did not duly appreciate the great hold
which astrology already had in the twelfth century, but it is
nevertheless true that in the new Aristotle astrology found
further support.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Astrology
and magic
in the
<i>Theology</i>
and <i>De
pomo</i> of
Aristotle.</div>

<p>Astrology crops out here and there in most of the spurious
works extant under Aristotle’s name, just as it does in
medieval learning everywhere. One section of a dozen
pages in the <i>Theology</i> discusses the influence of the stars
upon nature and the working of magic by making use of
these celestial forces and the natural attraction which things
have for one another. It regards artificial magic as a fraud
but natural and astrological magic as a reality. However,
as in the original text of Plotinus which the <i>Theology</i> follows,
it is only the animal soul which is affected by magic
and the man of impulse who is moved thereby; the thinking
man can free himself from its influence by use of the rational
soul. In the treatise, <i>De pomo</i>,<a id="FNanchor_788" href="#Footnote_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a> which seems not to have been
translated into Latin until the thirteenth century under Manfred,<a id="FNanchor_789" href="#Footnote_789" class="fnanchor">[789]</a>
Aristotle on his death bed, holding in his hand an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
apple from which the treatise takes its title, is represented
as telling his disciples why a philosopher need not fear death
and repudiating the doctrines of the mortality of the soul
and eternity of the universe. He also tells how the Creator
made the spheres and placed lucid stars in each and gave
them the virtue of ruling over this inferior world and causing
good and evil and life or death. They do not, however,
do this of themselves, but men at first thought so and
erroneously worshiped the stars until the time of Noah who
was the first to recognize the Creator of the spheres.<a id="FNanchor_790" href="#Footnote_790" class="fnanchor">[790]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Liber de
causis
proprietatum
elementorum
et planetarum.</i></div>

<p>There are also attributed to Aristotle treatises primarily
astrological. A “Book on the Properties of the Elements
and of the Planets” is cited under his name by Peter of
Abano at the end of the thirteenth century in his work on
poisons,<a id="FNanchor_791" href="#Footnote_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a> by Peter d’Ailly in his <i>Vigintiloquium</i><a id="FNanchor_792" href="#Footnote_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a> written
in 1414, and by Pico della Mirandola, who declares it spurious,
in his work against astrology written at the close of
the fifteenth century. D’Ailly and Pico cite it in regard to
the theory of great conjunctions; Abano, for a tale of Socrates
and two dragons which we shall repeat later. It is
probable that all these citations were from the paraphrase
of and commentary on the work by Albertus Magnus<a id="FNanchor_793" href="#Footnote_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a> who
accepted it as a genuine writing of Aristotle. We shall consider
its contents in our chapter upon Albertus Magnus.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Other

to Aristotle.</div>

<p>In a manuscript of the Cotton collection in the British
Museum is a work of some length upon astrology ascribed to
Aristotle.<a id="FNanchor_794" href="#Footnote_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a> After a discussion of general principles in which
the planets, signs, and houses are treated, there are separate
books upon the subjects of nativities,<a id="FNanchor_795" href="#Footnote_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a> and of elections and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
interrogations.<a id="FNanchor_796" href="#Footnote_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a> In a Paris manuscript a treatise on interrogations
is ascribed in a marginal heading to “Aristoteles
Milesius, a Peripatetic physician.”<a id="FNanchor_797" href="#Footnote_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a> In the Cotton Manuscript
in commentaries which then follow, and which are
labelled as commentaries “upon the preceding treatise”
Ptolemy is mentioned rather than Aristotle.<a id="FNanchor_798" href="#Footnote_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a> In an astrological
manuscript of the fifteenth century at Grenoble written
in French, works of Messahala and Zaël translated for
Charles V of France are preceded by “a book of judicial
astrology according to Aristotle,” which opens with “the
preface of the last translator,” and is in four parts.<a id="FNanchor_799" href="#Footnote_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a> Perhaps
both the above-mentioned manuscripts contain, like a
third manuscript at Munich, “The book of judgments which
is said by Albert in his <i>Speculum</i> to be Aristotle’s.”<a id="FNanchor_800" href="#Footnote_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a> This
work also occurs in a manuscript at Erfurt.<a id="FNanchor_801" href="#Footnote_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a> Roger Bacon
was much impressed by an astrological treatise ascribed to
Aristotle entitled <i>De impressionibus coelestibus</i>, and told
Pope Clement IV that it was “superior to the entire philosophy
of the Latins and can be translated by your order.”<a id="FNanchor_802" href="#Footnote_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Aristotle

<p>A treatise found in two manuscripts of the Bodleian
Library bears the titles, <i>Commentary of Aristotle on Astrology</i>,
and <i>The book of Aristotle from two hundred and
fifty-five volumes of the Indians, containing a digest of all
problems, whether pertaining to the sphere or to genethlialogy</i>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span><a id="FNanchor_803" href="#Footnote_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a>
From the text itself and the preface of Hugo Sanctelliensis,
the twelfth century translator from Arabic into
Latin, addressed to his lord, Michael, bishop of Tarazona,
we see that the work is neither entirely by Aristotle nor from
the books of the Indians but is a compilation by someone who
draws or pretends to draw from some 250 or 255 books<a id="FNanchor_804" href="#Footnote_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a>
of the philosophers, including in addition to treatises by
both Aristotle and the Indians, 13 books by Hermes, 13 by
Doronius (Dorotheus?), 4 by Ptolemy, one by Democritus,
two by Plato, 44 by the Babylonians, 7 by Antiochus, and
others by authors whose names are unfamiliar to me and
probably misspelled in the manuscripts. In one of the
works of Aristotle of which the present work is supposed
to make use, there are said to have been described the nativities
of twelve thousand men, collected in an effort to establish
an experimental basis for astrology.<a id="FNanchor_805" href="#Footnote_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a> It is not so
surprising that the present work bears Aristotle’s name, since
Hugh had promised his patron Michael, in the prologue to
his translation of the <i>Geometry</i> of Hanus ben Hanne,<a id="FNanchor_806" href="#Footnote_806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a> that
if life endured and opportunity was given he would next
set to work as ordered by his patron, not only upon Haly’s
commentaries on the <i>Quadripartite</i> and <i>Almagest</i> of Ptolemy,
but also upon a certain general commentary by Aristotle
on the entire art of astrology.</p>

forms are ruled by supercelestial forms through the spirits
of the spheres” and that incantations and images receive
their force from the spheres. The seven planets pass on
these supercelestial ideas and forms to our inferior world.
By selecting proper times for operating one can work good
or ill by means of the rays and impressions of the planets.
The scientific investigator who properly concentrates and
fixes intent, desire, and appetite upon the desired goal can
penetrate hidden secrets of secrets and occult science both
universal and particular. The writer goes on to emphasize
the importance of understanding all the different positions
and relationships of the heavenly bodies and also the distribution
of terrestrial objects under the planets. He then
describes an astrological image which will cause men to reverence
and obey you, will repel your enemies in terror, afflict
the envious, send visions, and perform other marvelous
and stupefying feats too numerous to mention.</p>

<div class="sidenote">And on
necromantic
images.</div>

<p>As the <i>Speculum astronomiae</i> of Albertus Magnus listed
a <i>Book of Judgments</i> by Aristotle among deserving works of
astronomy and astrology, so in its list of evil books dealing
with necromantic images appear a treatise by Hermes addressed
to Aristotle and opening, “Aristotle said, ‘You have
seen me, O Hermes,’” and a treatise ascribed to Aristotle
with the sinister title, <i>Death of the Soul</i>, opening, “Said
Aristotle to King Alexander, ‘If you want to perceive.’”
This treatise the <i>Speculum</i> calls “the worst of all” the evil
books on images. Roger Bacon, too, alludes to it by title as
filled with figments of the magicians, but does not name
Aristotle as author.<a id="FNanchor_808" href="#Footnote_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a> Peter of Abano in his <i>Lucidator</i> follows
the <i>Speculum astronomiae</i> in listing it among depraved,
obscene, and detestable works.<a id="FNanchor_809" href="#Footnote_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span></p><div class="sidenote">Alexander
as an
astrologer.</div>

<p>Alexander himself, as well as Aristotle, had some medieval
reputation as an astrologer. We have already seen<a id="FNanchor_810" href="#Footnote_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a>
in the tenth and eleventh century manuscripts of the <i>Mathematica</i>
of Alhandreus, supreme astrologer, that “Alexander
of Macedon” was more than once cited as an authority, and
that there were also given “Excerpts from the books of
Alexander, astrologer, king,” and a “Letter of Argafalan to
Alexander.” Different from this, moreover, was the
<i>Mathematica</i> of Alexander, supreme astrologer, found in a
thirteenth century manuscript, in which from the movements
of the planets through the signs one is instructed how to
foretell prosperous and adverse journeys, abundance and
poverty, misfortune or death of a friend, or to discover
stolen articles, sorceries, buried treasure and so forth.<a id="FNanchor_811" href="#Footnote_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a> A
treatise on seven herbs related to the seven planets is sometimes
ascribed to Alexander,<a id="FNanchor_812" href="#Footnote_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a> but perhaps more often to
Flaccus Africanus, as we saw in Chapter 46, and at least
once to Aristotle.<a id="FNanchor_813" href="#Footnote_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Aristotle
and
spirits.</div>

<p>The association of astrological images with spirits of
the spheres in one of the above-mentioned works ascribed
to Aristotle has already brought us to the border-line of
our next topic, Aristotle and spirits. Under this caption
may be placed a work found in a fifteenth century manuscript.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span><a id="FNanchor_814" href="#Footnote_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a>
It also is in part astrological and is associated with
the name of Hermes as well as of Aristotle. Its title runs,
<i>The book of the spiritual works of Aristotle, or the book
Antimaquis, which is the book of the secrets of Hermes:
wonderful things can be accomplished by means of this book
and ’tis the ancient book of the seven planets</i>. The treatise
opens, “To every people and clime pertains a group of
spirits.” It then maps out these regions of different spirits
in accordance with the planets and signs of the zodiac.
Apparently this is the same work as that which Hunain ibn
Ishak translated into Arabic and of which he says, “Among
the works of Aristotle which we have found and translated
from Greek into Arabic was <i>The book of the Causes of
Spirituals</i> which has Hermes for author.... It is the book
in which Aristotle treats of the causes of spirituals, talismans,
the art of their operation, and how to hinder it, ordered
after the seven climates.”<a id="FNanchor_815" href="#Footnote_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a> It was probably some
such spurious work that William of Auvergne had in mind
when he spoke of Aristotle’s boast that a spirit had descended
unto him from the sphere of Venus.<a id="FNanchor_816" href="#Footnote_816" class="fnanchor">[816]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>On
plants</i>
and the
<i>Lapidary</i>.</div>

<p>No genuine work of Aristotle on vegetables or minerals
has come down to us to accompany his celebrated <i>History
of Animals</i>, but supposititious writings were soon found by
the Arabs to fill this gap. On plants a brief treatise by
Nicolaus Damascenus passed for Aristotle’s. Alfred of
Sarchel translated it from Arabic into Latin,<a id="FNanchor_817" href="#Footnote_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a> presumably
before the close of the twelfth century, since he dedicated it
to Roger of Hereford, and Albertus Magnus expanded its
two short books into seven long ones in his <i>De vegetabilibus
et plantis</i>. There also existed in Arabic a <i>Lapidary</i> ascribed
to Aristotle,<a id="FNanchor_818" href="#Footnote_818" class="fnanchor">[818]</a> which we have heard cited in the ninth
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
century by Costa ben Luca. Ruska believes the work to be
of Syrian and Persian origin,<a id="FNanchor_819" href="#Footnote_819" class="fnanchor">[819]</a> although one Latin text professes
to have been originally translated from Greek into
Syriac.<a id="FNanchor_820" href="#Footnote_820" class="fnanchor">[820]</a> Valentin Rose regarded it as the basis of all subsequent
Arabic mineralogy, but found only two Latin manuscripts
of it.<a id="FNanchor_821" href="#Footnote_821" class="fnanchor">[821]</a> Albertus Magnus in his <i>Minerals</i> confesses
that, although he had sought diligently in divers regions
of the world, he had seen only excerpts from Aristotle’s
work. But another writer of the thirteenth century, Arnold
of Saxony, cites translations of Aristotle on stones both
by Dioscorides, which would seem sheer nonsense, and by
Gerard, presumably of Cremona. Gerard’s translation occurs
in one of Rose’s manuscripts; the other seems to give
a version translated from the Hebrew.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Virtues
of gems.</div>

<p>In Gerard’s translation, a work marked by puerile Latin
style, the <i>Lapidary</i> of Aristotle is about equally devoted to
marvelous properties of stones and tales of Alexander the
Great. After some general discussion of stones and their
wonderful properties, particular gems are taken up. The
<i>gesha</i> brings misfortune. Its wearer sleeps poorly, has many
worries, many altercations and law-suits. If it is hung
about a boy’s neck, it makes him drivel. “There is great
occult force” in the magnet, and instructions are given how
to set water on fire with it. Several stones possess the
property of neutralizing spells and counteracting the work
of demons. With another stone the Indians make many
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
incantations. Vultures were the first to discover the virtue
of the stone <i>filcrum coarton</i> in hastening delivery. When
a female vulture was near death from the eggs hardening
in her body, the male flew off to India and brought back
this stone which afforded instant relief. Another stone is
so soporific that suspended about the neck it induces a sleep
lasting three days and nights, and the effects of which are
thrown off with difficulty even on the fourth day, when the
sleeper will awake but will act as if he were intoxicated
and will still seem sleepier than anyone else. Another stone
prevents a horse from whinnying, if suspended from his
neck.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Stories of
Alexander
and of
Socrates.</div>

<p>Other gems suggest stories of Alexander. Near the
frontier of India in a valley guarded by deadly serpents
whose mere glance was fatal were many precious gems.
Alexander disposed of the serpents by erecting mirrors in
which they might stare themselves to death, and he then
secured the gems by employing the carcasses of sheep in
the manner which we have already heard described by Epiphanius.<a id="FNanchor_822" href="#Footnote_822" class="fnanchor">[822]</a>
A somewhat similar tale is told of Socrates by
Albertus Magnus in his commentary on the pseudo-Aristotelian
work on the properties of the elements and planets.<a id="FNanchor_823" href="#Footnote_823" class="fnanchor">[823]</a>
In the reign of Philip of Macedon, who is himself described
as a philosopher and astronomer, the road between two
mountains in Armenia became so poisoned that no one could
pass. Philip vainly inquired the cause from his sages until
Socrates came to the rescue and, by erecting a tower as
high as the mountains with a steel mirror on top of it, saw
two dragons polluting the air. The mere glance of these
dragons was apparently not deadly, for men in air-tight
armor went in and killed them. The same story is told by
William of St. Cloud, who composed astronomical tables
based upon his own observations from about 1285 to 1321,
in which he detected errors in the earlier tables of Thebit,
Toulouse, and Toledo.<a id="FNanchor_824" href="#Footnote_824" class="fnanchor">[824]</a> In Peter of Abano’s treatise on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
poisons,<a id="FNanchor_825" href="#Footnote_825" class="fnanchor">[825]</a> however, although he too cites the Pseudo-Aristotle
<i>On the causes of the elements</i>, the mirror has become a glass
cave in which Socrates ensconces himself to observe the
serpents. A <i>Lapidary</i> dedicated to King Wenzel II of Bohemia
tells of Socrates’ killing a dragon by use of quicksilver.<a id="FNanchor_826" href="#Footnote_826" class="fnanchor">[826]</a>
That Socrates also shared the medieval reputation
of Aristotle and Plato for astrology and divination we have
already seen from the <i>Prenostica Socratis Basilei</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Alexander’s
submarine.</div>

<p>Similar to Abano’s tale of Socrates in the glass cave is
the story told a century earlier by Alexander Neckam of
Alexander himself. So sedulous an investigator of nature
was the Macedonian, says Neckam, that he went down in a
glass vessel to observe the natures and customs of the fishes.
He would seem to have remained submerged for some time,
since Neckam informs us that he took a cock with him in
order to tell when it was dawn by the bird’s crowing. This
primitive submarine had at least a suggestion of war about
it, since Neckam goes on to say that Alexander learned how
to lay ambushes against the foe by observing one army of
fishes attack another. Unfortunately, however, Alexander
failed to commit to writing his observations, whether military
or scientific, of deep-sea life; and Neckam grieves that
very few data on the natures of fishes have come to his attention.<a id="FNanchor_827" href="#Footnote_827" class="fnanchor">[827]</a>
We shall hear Roger Bacon tell of Alexander’s
descending to see the secrets of the deep on the authority of
Ethicus.<a id="FNanchor_828" href="#Footnote_828" class="fnanchor">[828]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span></p><div class="sidenote">Arabian
tales of
Alexander.</div>

<p>Neckam’s account differs a good deal from the story as
told by the Arabian historian, Masʿudi, in the tenth century.
There we read that, when Alexander was building the city
of Alexandria, monsters came from the sea every night and
overthrew the walls that had been built during the day.
Night watchmen proved of no avail, so Alexander had a
box made ten cubits long and five wide, with glass sides fastened
into the frame work by means of pitch and resin. He
then entered the box with two draughtsmen, who, after it
had been let down to the bottom of the sea, made exact drawings
of the monsters, who had human bodies but the heads
of beasts. From these sketches Alexander had images constructed
and placed on pillars, and these magic figures served
to keep off the monsters until the city was completed. But
the effect apparently began to wear off and talismans had
to be added on the pillars to prevent the monsters from
coming and devouring the inhabitants, as they had begun
to do again.<a id="FNanchor_829" href="#Footnote_829" class="fnanchor">[829]</a> Another Arab, Abu-Shâker, of the thirteenth
century, repeats a current tradition that Aristotle gave Alexander
a box of wax soldiers which were nailed, with inverted
spears and swords and severed bow-strings, face-downwards
in the box, which in its turn was fastened by a
chain. As long as the box remained in Alexander’s possession
and he repeated the formulae which Aristotle taught
him whenever he took the box up or put it down, he would
triumph over his foes in war.<a id="FNanchor_830" href="#Footnote_830" class="fnanchor">[830]</a> This reminds one of the
methods of warfare employed by Alexander’s fabled natural
father, Nectanebus.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A magic
horn.</div>

<p>While we are speaking of military matters, it may be
noted that in a manuscript of the thirteenth century which
once belonged to an Albertus Bohemus or Beham, dean of
the church at Padua, and seems to have been his note-book,
we find between the <i>Secret of Secrets</i> of the Pseudo-Aristotle
and a treatise on the significations of the moon in the
signs “a delineation of a brazen horn made with marvelous
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
art by which Alexander in time of war summoned his army
from a distance of sixty miles.”<a id="FNanchor_831" href="#Footnote_831" class="fnanchor">[831]</a> Such a horn “of Temistius”
is mentioned in some versions of the <i>Secret of Secrets</i>.<a id="FNanchor_832" href="#Footnote_832" class="fnanchor">[832]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">More
stories of
Alexander
and gems.</div>

<p>But to return to other tales of Alexander in the <i>Lapidary</i>.
Once he saw afar enchanters and enchantresses who slew
and wounded the men of his army by their diabolical power
until Alexander prayed to God, who revealed two stones
which counteracted the sorcery. On another occasion when
by Alexander’s order his barons had carried off certain gems,
during the night following they suffered much insult from
demons and were sore afraid, since sticks and stones were
thrown about the camp by unseen hands and men were
beaten without knowing whence the blows came. It thus
became apparent that the demons cherished those gems as
their especial property and were accustomed to perform occult
operations with them of which they did not wish men
to learn the secret. Alexander found that these gems would
protect him from any beast, serpent, or demon, although the
nocturnal experience of his barons would scarcely seem to
support this last point. On a third occasion his troops were
held motionless and gazed open-mouthed at certain stones,
until a bird fluttered down and covered the gems with its
outstretched wings. Then Alexander had his followers close
their eyes and carry the stones away under cover and place
them on top of the wall of one of his cities so that no one
might scale the wall to spy upon the town.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Story
of Alexander’s
belt.</div>

<p>Yet another curious story of Alexander and a stone is
repeated by Peter of Abano in his work on poisons<a id="FNanchor_833" href="#Footnote_833" class="fnanchor">[833]</a> from
a treatise “On the Nature of Serpents” which he ascribes
to Aristotle. Alexander always wore a certain stone in
his belt to give him good luck in his battles, but on his return
from India, while bathing in the Euphrates, he removed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
the belt, whereupon a serpent suddenly appeared, bit
the stone out of the belt, and vomited it into the river. Deprived
of his talisman, Alexander presently met his death.<a id="FNanchor_834" href="#Footnote_834" class="fnanchor">[834]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The royal
<i>Lapidary</i>
of Wenzel
II of
Bohemia.</div>

<p>Another <i>Lapidary</i>, printed as Aristotle’s at Merseburg
in 1473, is really a compilation of previous medieval works
on the subject with the addition of some items derived from
the personal knowledge or experience of the author. It was
composed “to the honor of almighty God and the glory and
perpetual memory of that virtuous and most glorious prince,
Wenzel II, King of Bohemia” (1278-1305). As the treatise
itself states, “the Lapidary of Aristotle in the recent
translation from the Greek” is only one of its sources along
with Avicenna, Constantinus Africanus, Albertus Magnus,
and others.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Chiromancy</i>
and
<i>Physiognomy
of
Aristotle</i>.</div>

<p>Another work which claims Aristotelian authorship only
in its title is the <i>Chiromancy of Aristotle,</i> printed at Ulm in
1490, which quotes freely from Albertus Magnus and Avicenna.
There are also brief tracts on chiromancy ascribed
to Aristotle in manuscripts of the thirteenth or fourteenth
century.<a id="FNanchor_835" href="#Footnote_835" class="fnanchor">[835]</a> Förster has identified Polemon as the author of
the Greek treatise on physiognomy ascribed to Aristotle.<a id="FNanchor_836" href="#Footnote_836" class="fnanchor">[836]</a>
The art of physiognomy of course professed to read character
from the face or other parts of the body, and chiromancy
which we have just mentioned is really a branch of it.
In Latin translation the treatise was accepted as Aristotle’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
by such medieval schoolmen as Albertus Magnus and Duns
Scotus. There are many manuscripts of it in the British
Museum, including one which perhaps dates back to the
twelfth century.<a id="FNanchor_837" href="#Footnote_837" class="fnanchor">[837]</a> Its popularity continued long after the
invention of printing, as is shown by separate editions of it
brought out at Paris in 1535 and at Wittenberg in 1538,
and by commentaries upon it<a id="FNanchor_838" href="#Footnote_838" class="fnanchor">[838]</a> published at Paris in 1611, at
Bologna in 1621, and at Toulouse in 1636. Besides such
separate manuscripts and editions of it, it was also regularly
embodied in the numerous copies of the pseudo-Aristotelian
work to which we next turn.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The
Secret of
Secrets.</i></div>

<p>Most widely influential upon the medieval mind of all
the spurious works attributed to Aristotle was <i>The Secret
of Secrets</i>. Förster enumerated two hundred and seven
Latin manuscripts of it and his list is probably far from
complete.<a id="FNanchor_839" href="#Footnote_839" class="fnanchor">[839]</a> Gaster calls it “The most popular book of the
middle ages.”<a id="FNanchor_840" href="#Footnote_840" class="fnanchor">[840]</a> This is not surprising since it purports to
sum up in concise form what the greatest of ancient philosophers
deemed it essential for the greatest of ancient rulers
to know, and since under the alluring pretense of revealing
great secrets in parable and riddle it really masses together
a number of the best-tested and most often repeated maxims
of personal hygiene and practical philosophy, and some of
the superstitions to which men have shown themselves most
inclined. Every European library of consequence contains
a number of copies of it. It was translated into almost every
European language and was often versified, as in Lydgate’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
and Burgh’s <i>Secrees of old Philisoffres</i>.<a id="FNanchor_841" href="#Footnote_841" class="fnanchor">[841]</a> Albertus Magnus
cited it as Aristotle’s;<a id="FNanchor_842" href="#Footnote_842" class="fnanchor">[842]</a> Roger Bacon wrote a rather jejune
commentary upon it.<a id="FNanchor_843" href="#Footnote_843" class="fnanchor">[843]</a> It was printed a number of times
before 1500.<a id="FNanchor_844" href="#Footnote_844" class="fnanchor">[844]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Its
textual
history.</div>

<p>The <i>Secrets of Secrets</i> is believed to be the outcome of a
gradual process of compilation from very varied sources,
and to have reached something like its present form by the
seventh or eighth century of our era. But its chapters on
physiognomy, as we have seen, go back to Polemon’s treatise,
and part of its medical discussion is said to be borrowed
from Diocles Caristes who wrote about 320 B. C.
Some Graeco-Persian treatise is thought to be the basis of
its discussion of kingship. It is also believed to have
appropriated bits from popular literature to its own uses.
In Arabic there is extant both a longer and a shorter version,
and Gaster has edited a Hebrew text which is apparently
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
derived from an Arabic original different from that
of any Latin text. The process of successive compilation,
or at least, re-editing and repeated translation which the
work underwent is suggested by a series of prologues which
occur at the beginning. Following the preface of the Latin
translator and the table of contents comes what is called “the
prologue of a certain doctor in commendation of Aristotle,”<a id="FNanchor_845" href="#Footnote_845" class="fnanchor">[845]</a>
in which omnipotent God is prayed to guard the king and
some anonymous editor states that he has executed the mandate
enjoined upon him to procure the moral work on royal
conduct called <i>The Secret of Secrets</i>, which Aristotle, chief
of philosophers, composed. After some talk about Aristotle
and Alexander a second prologue begins with the sentence,
“John who translated this book, son of a patrician, most skilful
and faithful interpreter of languages, says.” This John
appears to have been Yuhanna ibn el-Batrik, or Ibn Yahya
al-Batrik, who died in 815 A. D.<a id="FNanchor_846" href="#Footnote_846" class="fnanchor">[846]</a> What he says is that he
searched the world over until he came to an oracle of the
sun which Esculapides had constructed. There he found a
solitary abstemious sage who presented him with this book
which he translated from Greek into Chaldaic and thence
into Arabic. This passage reminds one of Harpocration’s
prefatory remarks to his daughter in the <i>Kiranides</i>; indeed,
it is quite in the usual style of apocryphal writings.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Latin
translations
of
John of
Spain and
Philip.</div>

<p>In the matter of the Latin translation we are on somewhat
more certain ground. John of Spain in the first half
of the twelfth century seems to have translated only the
medical portion.<a id="FNanchor_847" href="#Footnote_847" class="fnanchor">[847]</a> Manuscripts of this partial translation are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
relatively few,<a id="FNanchor_848" href="#Footnote_848" class="fnanchor">[848]</a> and it was presently superseded by the complete
translation made either in the twelfth or early thirteenth
century<a id="FNanchor_849" href="#Footnote_849" class="fnanchor">[849]</a> by Philip, “the least of his clerics” for “his
most excellent lord, most strenuous in the cult of the Christian
religion, Guido of Valencia, glorious pontiff of the city
of Tripoli.” Philip goes on to say in his dedicatory preface
that it was when he was with Guido in Antioch that they
found “this pearl of philosophy, ... this book which contains
something useful about almost every science,” and
which it pleased Guido to have translated from Arabic into
Latin. Although the various printed editions and manuscripts
of <i>The Secret of Secrets</i> in Latin vary considerably,
they regularly are preceded by this ascription of the Latin
translation to Philip, and usually by the other prologues
afore-mentioned. Who this Philip was, other than a cleric
of Tripoli, is still undetermined. If he was the same as the
papal physician whom Alexander III in 1177 proposed to
send on a mission to Prester John,<a id="FNanchor_850" href="#Footnote_850" class="fnanchor">[850]</a> he had probably made
his translation before that date. J. Wood Brown would
identify him with Philip of Salerno, a royal notary whose
name appears in 1200 on deeds in the kingdom of Sicily.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span><a id="FNanchor_851" href="#Footnote_851" class="fnanchor">[851]</a>
I have already suggested that possibly he translated the
<i>Kiranides</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Philip’s
preface.</div>

<p>Returning to Philip’s preface to Guido, it may be noted
that he states that Latins do not have the work, and that it is
rare among the Arabs.<a id="FNanchor_852" href="#Footnote_852" class="fnanchor">[852]</a> His translation is a free one since
the Arabic idiom is different from the Latin. Aristotle
wrote this book in response to the petition of King Alexander
his disciple who demanded that Aristotle should either
come to him or faithfully reveal the secrets of certain arts,
namely, the motion, operation, and power of the stars in
astronomy, the art of alchemy, the art of knowing natures
and working enchantments, and the art of geomancy. Aristotle
was too old to come in person, and although it had been
his intention to conceal in every way the secrets of the said
sciences, yet he did not venture to contradict the will and
command of so great a lord. He hid some matters, however,
under enigmas and figurative locutions. For Alexander’s
convenience he divided the work into ten books,
each of which is divided into chapters and headings. Philip
adds that for his readers’ convenience he has collected
these headings at the beginning of the work, and a table of
contents follows.<a id="FNanchor_853" href="#Footnote_853" class="fnanchor">[853]</a> Then come the two older prologues
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
which we have already described, next a letter of Aristotle
to Alexander on the extrinsic and intrinsic causes of his
work,<a id="FNanchor_854" href="#Footnote_854" class="fnanchor">[854]</a> and then with a chapter which is usually headed
<i>Distinctio regum</i> or <i>Reges sunt quatuor</i> begins the discussion
of kingship which is the backbone of the work.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Prominence
of
occult
science.</div>

<p>It is evident from Philip’s preface that occult science also
forms a leading feature in the work as known to him. Gaster,
who contended that the Hebrew translation from the
Arabic which he edited was as old as either John of Spain’s
or Philip’s Latin translations, although the oldest of the
four manuscripts which he collated for his text is dated
only in 1382 A. D., made a rather misleading statement
when he affirmed, “Of the astrology looming so largely in
the later European recensions the Hebrew has only a faint
trace.”<a id="FNanchor_855" href="#Footnote_855" class="fnanchor">[855]</a> As a matter of fact some of the printed editions
contain less astrology than the thirteenth century manuscripts,
while Gaster’s Hebrew version has much more than
“a faint trace” of astrology. But more of this later.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Absence
of mysticism.</div>

<p>On the other hand, I cannot fully subscribe to Steinschneider’s
characterization of <i>The Secret of Secrets</i> as “a
wretched compilation of philosophical mysticism and varied
superstition.”<a id="FNanchor_856" href="#Footnote_856" class="fnanchor">[856]</a> Of superstition there is a great deal, but of
philosophical mysticism there is practically none. Despite
the title and the promise in Philip’s preface of enigmatic
and figurative language, the tone of the text is seldom mystical,
and its philosophy is of a very practical sort.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Discussion
of kingship.</div>

<p>Nor can <i>The Secret of Secrets</i> be dismissed as merely “a
wretched compilation.” Those portions which deal with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
kingcraft and government display shrewdness and common
sense, worldly wisdom and knowledge of human nature, are
not restricted by being written from any one premise or
view-point, and often evince real enlightenment. Those
historians who have declared the love of fame a new product
of the Italian Renaissance should have read the chapter on
fame in this most popular book of the middle ages, where
we find such statements as that royal power ought not to be
desired for its own sake but for the sole purpose of achieving
fame. Other noteworthy utterances indicative of the tone
and thought of the book are that “the intellect ... is the
root of all things praiseworthy”; that kings should cultivate
the sciences; that liberality involves respect for others’ property;
that “war destroys order and devastates the lands and
turns everything to chaos”; that no earthly ruler should shed
blood, which is reserved for God alone, but limit his punishments
to imprisonment, flogging, and torture; that the king,
as Chief Justice Coke later told James I, is under the law;
that taxes upon merchants should be light so that they will
remain in the country and contribute to its prosperity; that
his people are a king’s true treasury and that he should acquaint
himself with their needs and watch over their interests.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Medical
discussion.</div>

<p>From the medical passages of the book one would infer
that the art of healing at first developed more slowly than
the art of ruling in the world’s history. The medical theory
of <i>The Secret of Secrets</i> is not of an advanced or complex
sort, but is a combination of curious notions, such as that
vomiting once a month or oftener is beneficial, and sensible
ideas, such as that life consists of natural heat and that it is
very important to keep the abdomen warm and the bowels
moving regularly. Turkish baths are described for perhaps
the first time in Europe, and Alexander is advised to keep
his teeth and mouth clean. The well-known apothegm of
Hippocrates is quoted, “I would rather eat to live than live
to eat,” and Alexander is advised to cease eating while he
still has an appetite.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Astrology.</div>

<p>Much of the advice offered to Alexander by Aristotle in
<i>The Secret of Secrets</i> is astrological. Among those studies
which the king should promote, the only one specifically
mentioned is astrology, which considers “the course of the
year and of the stars, the coming festivals and solemnities
of the month, the course of the planets, the cause of the
shortening and lengthening of days and nights, the signs of
the stars which determine the future and many other things
which pertain to prediction of the future.”<a id="FNanchor_857" href="#Footnote_857" class="fnanchor">[857]</a> Alexander is
adjured “not to rise up or sit down or eat or drink or do anything
without consulting a man skilled in the art of astronomy.”<a id="FNanchor_858" href="#Footnote_858" class="fnanchor">[858]</a>
Later the two parts of astronomy are distinguished,
that is, astronomy and astrology in our sense of
the words. Alexander is further warned to put no faith in
the utterances of those stupid persons who declare that the
science of the stars is too difficult to master. No less stupid
is the argument of others who affirm that God has foreseen
and foreordained everything from eternity and that consequently
all things happen of necessity and it is therefore
of no advantage to predict events which cannot be avoided.
For even if things happened of necessity, it would be easier
to bear them by foreknowing and preparing for them beforehand,
just as men make preparations against the coming of
a cold winter&mdash;the familiar contention of Ptolemy. But
<i>The Secret of Secrets</i> also believes that one should pray God
in His mercy to avert future evils and ordain otherwise,
“For He has not so ordained things that to ordain otherwise
derogates in any respect from His Providence.” But
this is not so approved astrological doctrine. Later in the
work Alexander is once more urged never to take medicine
or open a vein except with the approval of his astronomers,<a id="FNanchor_859" href="#Footnote_859" class="fnanchor">[859]</a>
and directions are given as to the constellations under which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
bleeding should be performed and also concerning the taking
of laxatives with reference to the position of the moon
in the signs of the zodiac.<a id="FNanchor_860" href="#Footnote_860" class="fnanchor">[860]</a> Later the work discusses the
relations of the four elements and of various herbs to the
seven planets,<a id="FNanchor_861" href="#Footnote_861" class="fnanchor">[861]</a> and in the next to last chapter Alexander is
advised to conduct his wars under the guidance of astrology.<a id="FNanchor_862" href="#Footnote_862" class="fnanchor">[862]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Story of
the two
boys.</div>

<p>There is much indulging in astrological theory in the
midst of the chapter on Justice, and the constitution of the
universe is set forth from the first and highest simple spiritual
substance down through the nine heavens and spheres
to the lowest inferiors. To illustrate the power of the stars
the story is presently told of two boys,<a id="FNanchor_863" href="#Footnote_863" class="fnanchor">[863]</a> one a weaver’s son,
the other a royal prince of India. Sages who were chance
guests in the weaver’s house at the time of the child’s birth
noted that his horoscope was that of a courtier high in royal
councils but kept their discovery to themselves. The boy’s
parents vainly tried to make a weaver of him, but even
beatings were in vain; he was finally allowed to follow his
natural inclination, secured an education, and became in
time a royal governor. The king’s son, on the contrary,
despite his royal birth and the fact that his father sent him
through all his provinces to learn the sciences, would take
no interest in anything except mechanics conformably to his
horoscope.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Virtues
of stones
and herbs,
incantations
and
amulets.</div>

<p>In <i>The Secret of Secrets</i> the Pseudo-Aristotle refers
Alexander for the virtues of gems and herbs to his treatises
on stones and plants, presumably those which we have already
described. He does not entirely refrain from discussion
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
of such marvelous properties in the present work, however,
mentioning the use of the virtues of stones in connection
with incantations. We also again hear of stones
which will prevent any army from withstanding Alexander
or which will cause horses to whinny or keep them from
doing so; and of herbs which bring true or false dreams or
cause joy, love, hate, honor, reverence, courage, and inertia.<a id="FNanchor_864" href="#Footnote_864" class="fnanchor">[864]</a>
One recipe reads, “If you take in the name of someone
seven grains of the seeds of the herb called androsimon,
and hold them in his name when Lucifer and Venus are rising
so that their rays touch him (or them?), and if you give
him those seven grains to eat or pulverized in drink, fear
of you will ever abide in his heart and he will obey you for
the rest of his life.”<a id="FNanchor_865" href="#Footnote_865" class="fnanchor">[865]</a> The discussion of incantations, astrological
images, and amulets is omitted from many Latin
manuscripts but occurs in Roger Bacon’s version.<a id="FNanchor_866" href="#Footnote_866" class="fnanchor">[866]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Thirteenth
century
scepticism.</div>

<p>The extreme powers attributed to herbs and stones in
<i>The Secret of Secrets</i> aroused some scepticism among its
Latin readers of the thirteenth century.<a id="FNanchor_867" href="#Footnote_867" class="fnanchor">[867]</a> Geoffrey of Waterford,
a Dominican from Ireland who died about 1300,
translated <i>The Secret of Secrets</i> into French. He criticized,
however, its assertions concerning the virtues of stones and
herbs as more akin to fables than to philosophy, a fact of
which, he adds, all clerks who know Latin well are aware.
He wonders why Alexander had to win his battles by hard
fighting when Aristotle is supposed to inform him in this
book of a stone which will always rout the enemy. Geoffrey
decides that such false statements are the work of the
translators and that Aristotle is the author only of what is
well said or reasonable in the work.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Number
and
alchemy.</div>

<p>Something is said in <i>The Secret of Secrets</i> of the occult
properties and relative perfection of numbers, and as usual
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
the preference is for the numbers, three, four, seven, and
ten.<a id="FNanchor_868" href="#Footnote_868" class="fnanchor">[868]</a> The Hebrew version adds a puerile method of divining
who will be victor in a battle by a numerical calculation
based upon the letters in the names of the generals. The
Latin versions of the thirteenth century contain a chapter on
alchemy which had great influence and gives a recipe for the
philosopher’s stone and the Emerald Table of Hermes.<a id="FNanchor_869" href="#Footnote_869" class="fnanchor">[869]</a> But
in the Hebrew version and Achillini’s printed text occurs a
passage in which Alexander is warned that alchemy is not
a true science.<a id="FNanchor_870" href="#Footnote_870" class="fnanchor">[870]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
poisonous
maiden.</div>

<p>We may conclude our picture of the work’s contents with
two of its stories, namely, concerning the poisonous maiden
and the Jew and the Magus. A beautiful maiden was sent
from India to Alexander with other rich gifts. But she had
been fed upon poison from infancy “until she was of the
nature of a snake. And had I not perceived it,” continues
Aristotle in the Hebrew version, “for I suspected the clever
men of those countries and their craft, and had I not found
by tests that she would kill thee by her embrace and by her
perspiration, she surely would have killed thee.”<a id="FNanchor_871" href="#Footnote_871" class="fnanchor">[871]</a> This
venomous maiden is also alluded to in various medieval discussions
of poisons. Peter of Abano mentions her in his
<i>De venenis</i>.<a id="FNanchor_872" href="#Footnote_872" class="fnanchor">[872]</a> Gilbert of England, following no doubt Gerard
of Cremona’s translation of Avicenna, cites Ruffus
rather than the Pseudo-Aristotle concerning her and says
nothing of her relations with Alexander, but adds that animals
who approached her spittle were killed by it.<a id="FNanchor_873" href="#Footnote_873" class="fnanchor">[873]</a> In <i>Le
Secret aux philosophes</i>, a French work of the closing thirteenth
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
century, where the story is told at considerable length,
Socrates rather than Aristotle saves Alexander from the
poisonous maid.<a id="FNanchor_874" href="#Footnote_874" class="fnanchor">[874]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Jew
and the
Magus.</div>

<p>In the other story a Magus is represented in a much more
favorable light than magicians generally were; he seems to
represent rather one of the Persian sages. He was traveling
on a mule with provisions and met a Jew traveling on
foot. Their talk soon turned to their respective religions
and moral standards. The Magus professed altruism; the
Jew was inclined to get the better of all men except Jews.
When these principles had been stated, the Jew requested the
Magus, since he professed to observe the law of love, to
dismount and let him ride the mule. No sooner had this
been done than the Jew, true to his law of selfishness and
hate, made off with both mule and provisions. This misfortune
did not lead the Magus to lose his faith in God,
however, and as he plodded along he by and by came again
upon the Jew who had fallen off the mule and broken his
neck. The Magus then mercifully brought the Jew to the
nearest town where he died, while the king of the country
made the Magus one of his trusted ministers of state.<a id="FNanchor_875" href="#Footnote_875" class="fnanchor">[875]</a></p>

quod ars dirivata sit ex creatione
hominis cui omnia insunt ... /

In the text itself, which is
written in the manner of a master
to a disciple, there is nothing to
show that the work is by Alexander
rather than Aristotle.</p>

<p>The following is apparently the
same treatise but the closing words
are different.</p>

<p>Riccard. 1165, 15th century, fols.
161-3, Liber Alexandri in scientia
secretorum nature. “Dicitur quod
hec ars derivata sit ex creacione
hominis cui omnia insunt ... /
... et deo annuente ad optatum
finem pervenies.”</p>

<p>The next would seem to be
another treatise than the foregoing.</p>

<p>Arezzo 232, 15th century, fols.
1-14, “Liber transmissus ab Alexandro
rege ex libro Hermogenis.”</p>

<p>Hermogenes, who is cited on
the subject of the philosopher’s
stone in at least one MS of the
<i>Secret of Secrets</i> (Bodleian 67,
fol. 33v, “Et pater noster Hermogenes
qui triplex est in philosophia
optime philosophando dixit”),
is apparently none other than
Hermes Trismegistus. He is also
mentioned in a brief work of
Aristotle to Alexander; Harleian
3703, 14th century, fols. 41r-42r,
“... hermogenes quod (<i>sic</i>)
egypti multum commendunt et
laudant et sibi attribuant omnem
scientiam secretam et celerem
(?).” The use of the reflexive
pronoun in this sentence to refer
to Hermogenes I would have the
reader note, as it appears to illustrate
a fairly common medieval
usage which has or will lead me
to alter the translations which
have been proposed for certain
other passages.</p>

Gilgamesh epic, a work “far more
ancient than Genesis,” of a serpent
stealing a life-giving plant
from Gilgamesh while he was
bathing in a well or brook. The
plant, which had been revealed
to Gilgamesh by the deified Utnapishtim,
“had the miraculous
power of renewing youth and bore
the name, ‘the old man becomes
young.’” Sir James Frazer
(1918), I, 50-51, follows Rabbi
Julian Morgenstern (“On Gilgamesh
Epic, XI, 274-320,” in <i>Zeitschrift
f. Assyriologie</i>, XXIX,
1915, p. 284ff.) in connecting this
incident with the serpent and the
tree of life in the Biblical account
of the fall of man, and gives further
examples from primitive
folk-lore of other jealous animals,
such as the dog, frog, duck, and
lizard, perverting divine gifts or
good tidings to man to their own

<p><a id="Footnote_844" href="#FNanchor_844" class="label">[844]</a> There are considerable discrepancies
between the different
early printed editions, which differ
in length, order of arrangement,
tables of contents, and number of
chapters. And in the same edition
the chapter headings given
in the course of the text may not
agree with those in the table of
contents, which as a rule, even in
the MSS, does not fully cover the
subject-matter of the text. The
different printers have probably
used different manuscripts for
their editions rather than made
any new additions of their own.
The following editions are those
to which references will be made
in the following pages.</p>

<p>An edition printed at Cologne
about 1480, which I examined at
the Harvard University Library,
divides the text into only thirty
chapters and seems imperfect.</p>

<p>An edition of about 1485, which
I examined at the British Museum,
where it was numbered
IA.10756, has 74 chapters, and the
headings of its 25th and 30th
chapters, for instance, agree with
those of the 11th and 13th chapters
in the Harvard copy.</p>

<p>A third edition of Paris, 1520,
has no numbered chapters and
contains passages not found in
the two earlier editions.</p>

<p>As a check upon these printed
texts I have examined the three
following MSS, two of the 13th,
and one of the 14th, century. Of
these Egerton 2676 corresponds
fairly closely throughout to the
edition numbered IA.10756 in the
British Museum.</p>

<p>Egerton 2676, 13th century, fols.
3-52.</p>

<p>BN 6584, 13th century, fols. 1r-32v.</p>

<p>Bodleian 67, 14th century, fols.
1-53v, is much like the preceding
MS.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_851" href="#FNanchor_851" class="label">[851]</a> Brown (1897), pp. 19-20, 36-7.
But not much reliance can be
placed on the inclusion of this
name, “Master Philip of Tripoli,”
in a title which Brown (p. 20)
quotes from a De Rossi MS, “The
Book of the Inspections of Urine
according to the opinion of the
Masters, Peter of Berenico, Constantine
Damascenus, and Julius
of Salerno; which was composed
by command of the Emperor
Frederick, Anno Domini 1212, in
the month of February, and was
revised by Master Philip of Tripoli
and Master Gerard of Cremona
at the orders of the King of
Spain,” etc., since Gerard of
Cremona at least had died in
1187 and there was no “king of
Spain” until 1479.
Brown does not give the Latin
for the passage, but if the date
1212 could be regarded as Spanish
era and turned into 1174 A. D.,
Gerard of Cremona would still be
living, the emperor would be
Frederick Barbarossa instead of
Frederick II, and Master Philip
of Tripoli might be the same
Philip whom Pope Alexander III
proposed to send to Prester John
in 1177.</p>

<p>Steele (1920) p. xix, inclines to
identify Philip of Tripoli with a
canon of Byblos from 1243 to
1248, but that seems to me too late
a date for his translation of <i>The
Secret of Secrets</i>.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Solomon
as a
magician.</div>

<p>It was only natural that Solomon, regarded as the wisest
man in the history of the world, should be represented
in oriental tradition as the worker of many marvels and
that in the course of time books of magic should be attributed
to him, just as treatises on the interpretation of
dreams were ascribed to Joseph and Daniel. Roger Bacon
speaks of the magic books in a grand-sounding style which
were falsely ascribed to Solomon and which “ought all to be
prohibited by law.”<a id="FNanchor_876" href="#Footnote_876" class="fnanchor">[876]</a> Solomon’s reputation as a magician,
even in the western Latin-speaking world, was much older
than the thirteenth century, however. In 1918 Roman
archaeologists excavated at Ostia a bronze disc, on one
side of which was depicted Solomon as a magician, stirring
with a long ladle some mess in a large cauldron. On the
other side of the disc was a figure of the triple Hecate, who,
like Solomon, was surrounded by mystic signs and magic
characters.<a id="FNanchor_877" href="#Footnote_877" class="fnanchor">[877]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Magic
books
ascribed to
Solomon.</div>

<p>But to return to the medieval period. In the first half of
the thirteenth century William of Auvergne, bishop of
Paris, in his treatise on laws declares that there is no divinity
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
in the angles of Solomon’s pentagon, that the rings of
Solomon and the seals of Solomon and the nine candles
(<i>candariae</i>) are a form of idolatry, and involve execrable
consecrations and detestable invocations and images. “As
for that horrible image called the <i>Idea Salomonis et entocta</i>,
let it never be mentioned among Christians.” In the same
class are the book called <i>Sacratus</i> and the figure <i>Mandel</i> or
<i>Amandel</i>.<a id="FNanchor_878" href="#Footnote_878" class="fnanchor">[878]</a> Some years later Albertus Magnus, listing evil
books of necromantic images in his <i>Speculum astronomiae</i>,<a id="FNanchor_879" href="#Footnote_879" class="fnanchor">[879]</a>
includes five treatises current under the name of Solomon,
and seems to have in mind about the same works as William.
One is <i>De figura Almandel</i>, another <i>De novem candariis</i>, and
a third on the four rings (<i>De quatuor annulis</i>) opens with
the words “<i>De arte eutonica et ideica</i>,” which remind one
of William’s “<i>Idea Salomonis et entocta</i>,” and is perhaps
also identical with a <i>Liber de umbris idearum</i> cited under the
name of Solomon by Cecco d’Ascoli in his necromantic commentary
upon the <i>Sphere</i> of Sacrobosco,<a id="FNanchor_880" href="#Footnote_880" class="fnanchor">[880]</a> written in the
early fourteenth century.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Manuscripts
of them.</div>

<p>Moreover, these same works are apparently still extant in
manuscripts in European libraries. The figure Almandal
or Almandel and the rings of Solomon are found in fifteenth
century manuscripts at Florence and Paris,<a id="FNanchor_881" href="#Footnote_881" class="fnanchor">[881]</a> while in the
Sloane collection of the British Museum we find Solomon’s
pentagon, the divine seal, the four rings, and the nine candles,
all in seventeenth century manuscripts.<a id="FNanchor_882" href="#Footnote_882" class="fnanchor">[882]</a> In these seventeenth
century manuscripts also appear, and more than
once, the <i>Clavicula</i> or Key of Solomon, in French, Italian,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
and English,<a id="FNanchor_883" href="#Footnote_883" class="fnanchor">[883]</a> the book by Solomon called <i>Cephar</i> or <i>Saphar
Raziel</i>,<a id="FNanchor_884" href="#Footnote_884" class="fnanchor">[884]</a> and the <i>Liber sacer</i> or <i>sacratus</i>.<a id="FNanchor_885" href="#Footnote_885" class="fnanchor">[885]</a> The last-named
work, mentioned at least twice in the thirteenth century by
William of Auvergne, who calls it “a cursed and execrable
book,”<a id="FNanchor_886" href="#Footnote_886" class="fnanchor">[886]</a> is also found in manuscripts of the fourteenth
or fifteenth century,<a id="FNanchor_887" href="#Footnote_887" class="fnanchor">[887]</a> and we shall presently consider it in
particular as a specimen of the Pseudo-Solomon literature
and of medieval books of magic, theurgy, and necromancy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Notory
art of
Solomon
and Apollonius.</div>

<p>Let us first, however, note some other works ascribed
to Solomon and which have to do with the <i>Ars Notoria</i>, or
Notory Art, which seeks to gain knowledge from or communion
with God by invocation of angels, mystic figures,
and magical prayers. We are told that the Creator revealed
this art through an angel to Solomon one night while he
was praying, and that by it one can in a short time acquire
all the liberal and mechanical arts.<a id="FNanchor_888" href="#Footnote_888" class="fnanchor">[888]</a> There seems to be
little difference between the notory art of Solomon, that of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
Solomon, Machineus, and Euclid,<a id="FNanchor_889" href="#Footnote_889" class="fnanchor">[889]</a> and the <i>Golden Flowers</i>
of Apollonius,<a id="FNanchor_890" href="#Footnote_890" class="fnanchor">[890]</a> in which Solomon is mentioned almost every
other sentence. Cecco d’Ascoli may have had it in mind
when he cited the <i>Book of Magic Art</i> of Apollonius and
the <i>Angelic Faction</i> of the same author.<a id="FNanchor_891" href="#Footnote_891" class="fnanchor">[891]</a> In one manuscript
at the close of the <i>Golden Flowers</i> of Apollonius are
prayers which one “brother John Monk” confesses he himself
has composed in the years 1304-1307.<a id="FNanchor_892" href="#Footnote_892" class="fnanchor">[892]</a> In a later manuscript
we find his prayers described as given to him by the
blessed God and as “perfect science,” and they are followed
by “The Pauline art,” discovered by the Apostle Paul after

<div class="sidenote">Other
works
ascribed to
Solomon
and Apollonius.</div>

<p>Certain works may be mentioned which are ascribed to
Solomon or to Apollonius in the medieval manuscripts, and
which do not seem to be concerned with the notory art.
Experiments ascribed to Solomon will be mentioned in another
place in connection with experimental literature.
Treatises of alchemy and astrology also were attributed to
him.<a id="FNanchor_896" href="#Footnote_896" class="fnanchor">[896]</a> Under the name of Apollonius we find a work on
the properties or occult virtue of things, and another, or
possibly the same, on the principal causes of things.<a id="FNanchor_897" href="#Footnote_897" class="fnanchor">[897]</a> One
wonders if it may have any connection with the book on six
principles of things ascribed to Hermes Trismegistus and
which has been discussed in our chapter on <i>Hermetic Books
in the Middle Ages</i>. A treatise on palmistry is ascribed to
Solomon in a fourteenth century manuscript at Cambridge.<a id="FNanchor_898" href="#Footnote_898" class="fnanchor">[898]</a>
A “Philosophy of Solomon” in a manuscript of the late
twelfth century in the British Museum consists of “notes
perhaps from more than one source on the analogy between
the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the three divisions
of philosophy (<i>moralis</i>, <i>naturalis</i>, <i>inspectiva</i>), and the
three books of Solomon.”<a id="FNanchor_899" href="#Footnote_899" class="fnanchor">[899]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Liber
sacratus</i>:
preface.</div>

<p>The <i>Liber sacratus</i>, as William of Auvergne twice entitles
it, or the <i>Liber sacer</i> or <i>Liber juratus</i>, as it is also
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
called in the manuscripts,<a id="FNanchor_900" href="#Footnote_900" class="fnanchor">[900]</a> is associated with the name Honorius
as well as Solomon, and is often spoken of as <i>The
Sworn Book of Honorius</i>. The preface, as given in the
Latin manuscripts of the fourteenth century&mdash;one of which
once belonged to Ben Jonson&mdash;states that under the influence
of evil spirits the pope and cardinals had passed a decree
aiming at the complete extirpation of the magic art and
condemning magicians to death. The grounds for this action
were that magicians and necromancers were injuring
everyone, transgressing the statutes of holy mother church,
making invocations and sacrifices to demons, and dragging
ignorant people down to damnation by their marvelous illusions.
These charges the magicians hotly deny as inspired
by the envy and cupidity of the devil who wished to keep
a monopoly of such marvels. The magicians declare that
it is impossible for a wicked or impure man to work truly
by the magic art, in which they assert that the spirits are
compelled against their will by pure men. The magicians
further profess to have been forewarned by their art of this
legislation against them. They hesitate, however, to summon
the demons to their aid lest those spirits avail themselves
of the opportunity to destroy the populace utterly.
Instead an assembly of 89 masters from Naples, Athens, and
Toledo has chosen Honorius, son of Euclid,<a id="FNanchor_901" href="#Footnote_901" class="fnanchor">[901]</a> a master of
Thebes, to reduce their magic books to one volume containing
93 chapters, which they may more readily conceal and
preserve. And inasmuch as it has pleased the prelates and
princes to order the burning of their books and the destruction
of schools of magic, the followers of that art have taken
an oath not to give this volume to anyone until its owner is
on his death-bed, never to have more than three copies of it
made at a time, and never to give it to a woman or to a man
who is not of mature years and proved fidelity. Each new
recipient of the sacred volume is also to take this oath.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
Hence the name, <i>Juratus</i> or <i>Sworn-Book</i>. Its other titles,
<i>Sacer</i> or <i>Sacratus</i>, refer either to the sacred names of God
which constitute much of its text or to its consecration by
the angels.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Incipit</i>
and
<i>Explicit</i>.</div>

<p>After this proemium, which, like the magic art itself, is
probably more impressive than true, the work proper opens
with the statement, “In the name of almighty God and Jesus
Christ, one and true God, I, Honorius, have thus ordered the
works of Solomon in my book.” Later Honorius reiterates
that he is following the precepts and in the foot-prints of
Solomon, whom he also often cites or quotes in course.
The <i>Explicit</i> of the <i>Sworn-Book</i> is unusually long and sets
forth in grandiloquent style the purpose of the volume.</p>

<p>“So ends the book of the life of the rational soul,<a id="FNanchor_902" href="#Footnote_902" class="fnanchor">[902]</a> which
is entitled <i>Liber sacer</i> or <i>The Book of the Angels</i> or <i>Liber
juratus</i>, which Honorius, Master of Thebes, made. This is
the book by which one can see God in this life. This is the
book by which anyone can be saved and led beyond a doubt
to life eternal. This is the book by which one can see hell
and purgatory without death. This is the book by which
every creature can be subjected except the nine orders of
angels. This is the book by which all science can be learned.
This is the book by which the weakest substance can overcome
and subjugate the strongest substances. This is the
book which no religion possesses except the Christian, or if
it does, does so to no avail. This is the book which is a
greater joy than any other joy given by God exclusive of
the sacraments. This is the book by which corporeal and
visible nature can converse and reason with the incorporeal
and invisible and be instructed. This is the book by which
countless treasures can be had. And by means of it many
other things can be done which it would take too long to
enumerate; therefore it is deservedly called <i>The Holy Book</i>.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">A work
of theurgy
or the
notory art.</div>

<p>From this description it will be seen that the work has
a good deal to do with the so-called Notory Art. Moreover,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
in the manuscript copy said to have belonged to Ben Jonson
the word <i>Theurgia</i> is written on the fly-leaves before the beginning
and after the close of the text. This calls to mind
the passage in <i>The City of God</i><a id="FNanchor_903" href="#Footnote_903" class="fnanchor">[903]</a> where Augustine speaks
of “incantations and formulae composed by an art of depraved
curiosity which they either call magic or by the more
detestable name <i>goetia</i> or by the honorable title <i>theurgia.</i>
For they try to distinguish between these arts and condemn
some men, whom the populace calls <i>malefici</i>, as devoted to
illicit arts, for these, they say, are concerned with <i>goetia</i>;
but others they want to make out praiseworthy as being
engaged in theurgy. But they are both entangled in the deceptive
rites of demons who masquerade under the names
of angels.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Character
of its
contents.</div>

<p>The text is full of the names of spirits, prayers in
strange words, supposedly derived from Hebrew or Chaldaic,
and other gibberish. Series of letters and figures often occur
and names inscribed in stars, hexagons, and circles. An
English translation in a fifteenth century manuscript<a id="FNanchor_904" href="#Footnote_904" class="fnanchor">[904]</a> is
adorned with pictures of rows of spirits dressed like monks
in robes and caps but with angelic wings. The text does
not seem to be complete in any of the manuscripts that I
have examined,<a id="FNanchor_905" href="#Footnote_905" class="fnanchor">[905]</a> but Sloane 3854 of the fourteenth century
contains an apparently complete table of contents. The
chapter headings, anyway, are more intelligible than the
jargon of the text. The first chapter deals with the composition
of the great name of God which contains 72 letters.
The second is about the divine vision and by the time
it is finished we are nearly two-thirds through the space
allotted to the <i>Liber juratus</i> in one manuscript. The third
chapter is on knowledge of the divine power, the fourth on
absolution from sin, the fifth deals with mortal sin, the sixth
with the redemption of souls from purgatory. With this
the “first work” of the collection of Honorius ends. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
opening chapters of the second work discuss the heavens,
the angels found in each heaven and at the four points of
the compass, their names and powers, seals and virtues, and
invocation. Chapters 14 and 15 tell how to get your wish
from any angel or to acquire the sciences. Chapter 16 tells
how to learn the hour of one’s death, and chapter 17 how
to know all things, past, present, or future. It was perhaps
these chapters that William of Auvergne had in mind when,
in censuring works on divination by inspection of mirrors,
sword-blades, and human nails to discover stolen articles and
other hidden things, he added that “from this pest of curiosity
proceeded that accursed and execrable work called
<i>Liber sacratus</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_906" href="#Footnote_906" class="fnanchor">[906]</a> That work next returns for three chapters
to the stars and planets and their virtues and influence.
Chapter 21 then instructs how to turn day into night or
night into day. Next spirits are further considered, those
of air and those of fire, their names and their superior
spirits, their powers, virtues, and seals. Attention is then
given to the four elements and bodies composed thereof, to
herbs and plants, and to human nature, after which aquatic
and terrestrial spirits are discussed. The future life is then
considered and the 33rd chapter, which is the last one of the
“second work,” deals with “the consecration of this book.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The third
“work.”</div>

<p>The “third work,” which extends from chapter 34 to 87
inclusive, treats of the control of spirits by words, by seals,
by tables, and by shutting them up. It tells how to provoke
thunder and lightning, storms, snow, ice, rain, or dew; how
to produce flowers and fruit; how to become invisible; how
to wage war and to make an indestructible castle, how to destroy
a town by means of mirrors; how to sow discord or
concord, how to open closed doors, to catch thieves, fish, and
animals, and to produce varied apparitions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
fourth
and fifth
“works.”</div>

<p>The fourth work deals with similar marvels but it is
stated that two of its chapters, namely, 91 on the apparition
of dead bodies which speak and seem to be resuscitated, and
92 on the apparent creation of animals from earth, will be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
omitted as contrary to the will of God. The fifth work or
book, which seems to coincide with the 93rd and last chapter
of Honorius, is in reality divided into five chapters, which
return to themes similar to those of the first work.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How to
operate
with
spirits.</div>

<p>To illustrate further the character of the work a few
particular passages may be noticed. We are told that there
are three ways of operating by means of spirits: the pagan,
Jewish, and Christian. The pagans sacrificed to spirits of
earth and air but did not really constrain them. The spirits
only pretended to be coerced in order to encourage such
idolatrous practices. “Whoever wishes to operate by such
experiments” (mark the word!), “deserts the Lord God.”
As for the Jews, they get along only so-so, and “do in no
wise work to obtain the vision of the deity.” Only a Christian,
therefore, can operate successfully in such visions.
“And although three kinds of men work at this art of magic,
one should not think that there is any evil included in this
name of <i>magus</i>, for a <i>magus per se</i> is called a philosopher
in Greek, a scribe in Hebrew, and a sage in Latin.”<a id="FNanchor_907" href="#Footnote_907" class="fnanchor">[907]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The seal
of the
living
God.</div>

<p>Very elaborate directions are given for the composition
of the seal of the living God. Circles are drawn of certain
proportions emblematic of divine mysteries, a cross is made
within, numerous letters are written down equidistant from
one another. A pentagon and two hexagons have to be
placed just so in relation to one another; characters are inscribed
in their angles; and various sacred names of God,
Raphael, Michael, and other angels are written along their
sides. Different parts must be executed in different colors;
a particular kind of parchment must be employed; and the
blood of a mole or hoopoe or bat must be used as ink for
some of the writing. Finally, there are sacrifices, purifications,
suffumigations, invocations, and prayers to be performed
and offered. This seal, we are told, “will conquer
the celestial powers, subjugate the aerial and terrestrial together
with the infernal; invoke, transmit, conjure, constrain,
excite, gather, disperse, bind, and restore unharmed;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
will placate men and gain petitions from them graciously,
pacify enemies,”<a id="FNanchor_908" href="#Footnote_908" class="fnanchor">[908]</a> etc., etc.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Spirits
of Saturn.</div>

<p>The spirits associated with the planet Saturn are Bohel,
Casziel, Uuchathon, and Dacdel. Their nature is to cause
sadness and wrath and hate, to produce ice and snow. Their
bodies are long and large, pale or golden. Their region is
in the north and they have five or nine demons under them.<a id="FNanchor_909" href="#Footnote_909" class="fnanchor">[909]</a>
As a rule spirits of the north and south are ferocious, those
of the east and the west gentle.<a id="FNanchor_910" href="#Footnote_910" class="fnanchor">[910]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Oneirocritica</i>
of
Artemidorus.</div>

<p>Both Jews and Greeks at the beginning of the Christian
era were much given to the interpretation of dreams. There
were “established and frequented dreaming places” at the
shrines of Asclepius at Epidaurus, Amphiaraus at Oropus,
Amphilochus at Mallos, Sarpedon in the Troad, Trophonius
at Lebedea, Mopsus in Cilicia, Hermonia in Macedon, and
Pasiphaë in Laconia. We hear of dream-books by Artemon,
Antiphon, Strato, Philochoros, Epicharmus, Serapion, Cratippus,
Dionysius of Rhodes, and Hermippus of Beirut. But
the chief work upon the interpretation of dreams which has
reached us from the time of the Roman Empire is that of
Artemidorus, who was born at Ephesus and lived in Lydia
in the time of the Antonines. He of course wrote in Greek
and, despite the superstitious character of his work, in a
pure and refined Attic style. The Ὀνειροκριτικά has also
been translated into Latin, French, and Italian.<a id="FNanchor_911" href="#Footnote_911" class="fnanchor">[911]</a> It is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>
a compilation in five books gathered from previous literature
on the subject and by the author personally in travel in
Greece, Italy, and elsewhere. The first thirteen chapters
of the fourth book, which Artemidorus opens with a general
instruction to his son, deal with such preliminary and general
considerations as the different types of dreams and more
especially those divinely sent, the significance of times, the
personal qualifications requisite in the interpreter, and certain
rules of interpretation such as that native customs are
good signs and foreign ways bad signs in dreams. But the
great bulk of the work consists of specific interpretation arranged
either under topical headings such as “Concerning
Nativity,” or listed as single dreams.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Astrampsychos
and Nicephorus.</div>

<p>In the edition of 1603<a id="FNanchor_912" href="#Footnote_912" class="fnanchor">[912]</a> the work of Artemidorus is
followed by much briefer metrical treatises on the same
subject by Astrampsychos and Nicephorus.<a id="FNanchor_913" href="#Footnote_913" class="fnanchor">[913]</a> These poems,
if they may be so called, devote a line of interpretation to
each of the things seen in dreams, and these verses are arranged
in alphabetical order. This was to be the method of
arrangement adopted in the medieval dream-books ascribed
to the prophet Daniel. Astrampsychos is first named by
Diogenes Laertius<a id="FNanchor_914" href="#Footnote_914" class="fnanchor">[914]</a> in the early third century. He was
supposed to have been one of the Persian Magi, and other
occult treatises are ascribed to him, including astrological
writings, a book of oracles addressed to Ptolemy, and love
charms in a papyrus in the British Museum.<a id="FNanchor_915" href="#Footnote_915" class="fnanchor">[915]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Achmet
translated
by Leo
Tuscus.</div>

<p>Still another work on the interpretation of dreams contained
in the edition of 1603<a id="FNanchor_916" href="#Footnote_916" class="fnanchor">[916]</a> is ascribed to “Achmet, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
son of Sereim” or Ahmed ben Sirin.<a id="FNanchor_917" href="#Footnote_917" class="fnanchor">[917]</a> The Greek text
states that he was interpreter of dreams to Mamoun, the
first minister of the Caliph, which fixes his date as about
820 A. D.<a id="FNanchor_918" href="#Footnote_918" class="fnanchor">[918]</a> Perhaps he is the same Achmet who wrote an
astrological treatise extant in Greek which he says he
compiled from books from Adam’s time to the present day.<a id="FNanchor_919" href="#Footnote_919" class="fnanchor">[919]</a>
Of the work on dreams there is a Latin version in the
medieval manuscripts translated from the Greek by Leo
Tuscus,<a id="FNanchor_920" href="#Footnote_920" class="fnanchor">[920]</a> who died in 1182 and was interpreter of imperial
letters in the time of the Byzantine emperor, Manuel Comnenus.
Leo prefixes to his translation a prologue addressed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span><a id="FNanchor_921" href="#Footnote_921" class="fnanchor">[921]</a>
to his brother Hugo Eterianus or Eteriarius (Ecerialius).
This work of Achmet is of about the same length as that of
Artemidorus and contains over three hundred chapters. It
is or pretends to be drawn mainly from Indian, Persian, and
Egyptian sources and often cites in turn the doctrine or
interpretation of those three peoples, or mentions by name
interpreters of dreams of the kings and pharaohs of those
countries.<a id="FNanchor_922" href="#Footnote_922" class="fnanchor">[922]</a> The preface states that the same dream must be
interpreted differently in the case of king and commoner, of
rich and poor, and according to sex. The time of the dream
must also be taken into account. For example, to see a tree
blossom is a good sign in spring but a bad omen in autumn.
The hour of the night when the dream occurs and the phases
of the moon are other time factors which must be reckoned
with. The remainder of the treatise is devoted to specific interpretation
of dreams.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Byzantine
and
oriental
divinations
by
Daniel.</div>

<p>To Joseph and Daniel, as the chief Biblical interpreters
of dreams, books on the subject were assigned in the middle
ages, as John of Salisbury has informed us. Daniel,
however, seems to have been the greater favorite. Liutprand
the Lombard, who died in 972, says in the account
of his embassy to Constantinople, “The Greeks and Saracens
have books which they call the <i>horaseis</i>, or Visions, of Daniel,
but I should call them Sibylline. In them is found written
how many years each emperor will live, and what will
be the character of his reign, whether peace or strife,
whether favorable or hostile relations with the Saracens.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span><a id="FNanchor_923" href="#Footnote_923" class="fnanchor">[923]</a>
A brief set of Greek verses in alphabetical order ascribed
to the emperor Leo, which occur in a late manuscript with
various works of the fathers, seem to resemble the Latin
alphabetical dream-books of which we shall presently treat.<a id="FNanchor_924" href="#Footnote_924" class="fnanchor">[924]</a>
Works of divination were also attributed to Daniel in Syriac
and Arabic, such as predictions of rain, hail, and the like for
each day of the year, and of eclipses and earthquakes,<a id="FNanchor_925" href="#Footnote_925" class="fnanchor">[925]</a> or
astrological forecasts for each month of the year.<a id="FNanchor_926" href="#Footnote_926" class="fnanchor">[926]</a> There
is even a geomancy in Turkish ascribed to the prophet
Daniel.<a id="FNanchor_927" href="#Footnote_927" class="fnanchor">[927]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Latin
<i>Dream-Books
of
Daniel</i>.</div>

<p>Dream-Books ascribed to the prophet Daniel are found in
Latin manuscripts at least as early as the tenth century, and
continue through the fifteenth century despite the denial of
their authenticity by John of Salisbury in the twelfth century.
At least three different types of <i>Dream-Books of
Daniel</i> are represented in incunabula editions in the British
Museum.<a id="FNanchor_928" href="#Footnote_928" class="fnanchor">[928]</a> The <i>Dream-Book of Joseph</i> occurs with less
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
frequency.<a id="FNanchor_929" href="#Footnote_929" class="fnanchor">[929]</a> These Latin <i>Dream-Books</i> do not go into details
of politics like the Byzantine books which Liutprand
described. The simplest form, which we have already mentioned
in speaking of the Moon-Books of the tenth and eleventh
centuries, is according to the days of the moon.<a id="FNanchor_930" href="#Footnote_930" class="fnanchor">[930]</a> It is
often embodied in the fuller versions. Their usual arrangement
is an alphabetical list of objects seen in dreams with a
line of interpretation for each and perhaps a page for each
letter of the alphabet. Sample lines are:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Aerem serenum videre lucrum significat</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">(“To see a clear sky signifies gain”)</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Intestina sua videre secreta manifesta</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">(“To see one’s own intestines means secrets revealed”)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This alphabetical arrangement already appears in the early
manuscripts.<a id="FNanchor_931" href="#Footnote_931" class="fnanchor">[931]</a> Sometimes, however, the procedure is by
opening the Psalter at random, taking the first letter on the
page opened to, and then referring to a list where the letters
of the alphabet have various significations, such as “A
signifies power of delight,” “B signifies victory in war.”<a id="FNanchor_932" href="#Footnote_932" class="fnanchor">[932]</a>
This last method might, of course, be employed without
having any dream at all, and perhaps should not be regarded
as a Dream-Book. It is interesting to note that in one manuscript
it is called <i>Experiments of Daniel</i>. In these books of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>
Daniel further instructions are sometimes given, as when
it is stated that dreams which occur before midnight are of
no value for purposes of interpretation, or when one is told
before opening the Psalter to repeat on bended knees a Lord’s
Prayer, <i>Ave Maria</i>, and <i>Miserere</i>. Days to be observed are
also sometimes mentioned as a sort of accompaniment to the
<i>Dream-Book</i>: forty dangerous days “which the masters of
the Greeks have tested by experiment,”<a id="FNanchor_933" href="#Footnote_933" class="fnanchor">[933]</a> “bromantic days”
from the twenty-fourth of November to the eighteenth of
December, and “perentalic days” from the first of January
to the first of March. “And these are the days when the
leaves fall from the trees,” which is apparently supposed to
have a disturbing effect upon the clarity of dreams.<a id="FNanchor_934" href="#Footnote_934" class="fnanchor">[934]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Sompniale
dilucidarium
Pharaonis.</i></div>

<p><i>A Sompniale dilucidarium Pharaonis</i>, as it is entitled in
the manuscript of it which I have examined,<a id="FNanchor_935" href="#Footnote_935" class="fnanchor">[935]</a> or <i>Morale
somnium Pharaonis</i>, as it is called in the printed editions,<a id="FNanchor_936" href="#Footnote_936" class="fnanchor">[936]</a>
was addressed by a John of Limoges<a id="FNanchor_937" href="#Footnote_937" class="fnanchor">[937]</a> to Theobald, King
of Navarre and Count of Champagne and Brie, who died in
1216.<a id="FNanchor_938" href="#Footnote_938" class="fnanchor">[938]</a> It is really not a Dream-Book but a series of imaginary
and fulsomely rhetorical letters between Pharaoh and
his Magi, Pharaoh and Joseph, and Joseph and adulators and
detractors. John states in his introductory letter to Theobald
that the famous dream of Pharaoh will here be “morally
expounded concerning royal discipline.” Pharaoh typifies
any curious king; Egypt stands for any studious kingdom;
Joseph represents any virtuous counselor; and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>
dream will be interpolated with flowers of rhetoric and
theology.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An anonymous
<i>Exposition
of
Dreams</i>.</div>

<p>More elaborate and making more pretense to philosophical
character than the brief Dream-Books of Daniel is
an anonymous work on dreams contained in a Paris manuscript
of apparently the later part of the thirteenth century.<a id="FNanchor_939" href="#Footnote_939" class="fnanchor">[939]</a>
It is the first treatise in the manuscript, which further contains
two important works of the first half of the twelfth
century, namely, the <i>Imago mundi</i> of Honorius of Autun
and the <i>De philosophia</i> of William of Conches. The texts
of these two latter works are much cut up and intermixed
with each other. It is therefore not unlikely that the opening
treatise on dreams is also a work of the twelfth century, although
there does not seem to be much reason for ascribing it
either to Honorius of Autun or William of Conches. A long
<i>prohemium</i> fails to throw much light upon the personality of
the author, but the work does not seem to be a translation.
That it is not earlier than the twelfth century is indicated
by its citation of the <i>Viaticum</i> and <i>Passionarius</i>, presumably
the well known medical works of Constantine Africanus
and Gariopontus,<a id="FNanchor_940" href="#Footnote_940" class="fnanchor">[940]</a>&mdash;unless indeed it be by Constantinus
himself, to some of whose views it shows a resemblance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Physiological
origin of
dreams.</div>

<p>The preface opens by stating that a desirable treasure
lies hidden in the heart of the wise but that it is of no utility
unless it is revealed. In other words, dreams must be interpreted.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>
The author regards dreams, like thoughts in
general, as beginning with the <i>spiritus</i> which rises from the
heart and ascends through two arteries to the brain.<a id="FNanchor_941" href="#Footnote_941" class="fnanchor">[941]</a> Our
author perhaps still holds to Aristotle’s view of the importance
of the heart in the nervous system as against Galen’s
exclusive emphasis upon the brain, since he allots the heart
a share even in mental processes; and he seems to be ignorant
of Galen’s discovery that the arteries contain blood and
not <i>spiritus</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Origin and
justification
of
the art of
interpretation.</div>

<p>The preface goes on to justify the study of dreams on
the ground that “the most ancient Magi and perfect physicians”
thereby adjudged to each man health and sickness,
life and death. “Medicine and divine thoughts, dreams,
visions, or oracles are not prohibited, but demoniacal incantations,
sorcery, lot-castings, insomnia, and vain phantasms
are condemned that you may not readily trust in them.”<a id="FNanchor_942" href="#Footnote_942" class="fnanchor">[942]</a>
No doctrine is to be spurned wholesale, but only what is
vicious in it. Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego excelled
all the Magi and soothsayers of the Chaldeans. Our author
explains that among the Chaldeans then as today learning
consisted not of the philosophy and sophistry of the Greeks
and Latins, but of astronomy and interpretations of dreams.
He alludes to a prayer of seven verses which they repeat
when going to bed in order to receive responses in dreams.
They pay little heed to the superficial meaning of their
dreams, but by examining the inner meaning they learn either
past or future. The author exhorts the person to whom he
addresses the preface to do the same, laying aside all terrors
that dreams may arouse in him. He points out that interpretation
of dreams has Biblical sanction and that Joseph,
Daniel, and Marduch all profited thereby.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sources
of the
present
treatise.</div>

<p>As for the present treatise, it is collected from divine
and human scripture, based upon experience as well as reason,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
and drawn from Latins, Greeks, Persians, and the annals
of Pharaoh and Nebuchadnezzar in which many of their
dreams are recorded, for they were both lovers of the future
and, since they had no philosophers like the Gentiles,
God allowed them as a compensation to foresee the future
in dreams. For by dreams life and death, poverty and riches,
sickness and health, sorrow and joy, flight and victory, are
known more easily than through astrology, a more difficult
and manifold art.<a id="FNanchor_943" href="#Footnote_943" class="fnanchor">[943]</a> But lest his introduction grow too long,
the author at this point ends it and begins the text proper.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Demoniac
and natural
causes
of dreams.</div>

<p>After stating what a dream is, the author discusses the
origin and causes of dreams further. Some are from the
devil or at least are influenced by demons, as when a monk
was led to become a Jew by a dream in which he saw Moses
with a chorus of angels in white, while Christ was surrounded
by men in black. But when we see chimeras in
dreams, this is generally due to impurity of the blood. The
author also opines that, while the sage can judge from the
nature of the dream whether there is fallacy and illusion of
the demon in it, the origin of virtues and vices is mainly in
ourselves. He who goes to sleep with an easy conscience is
unlikely to be disturbed by nightmares and is more likely in
quiet slumber to behold secrets and mysteries. The author
next discusses the effect of the passions and exercise of the
mental faculties upon the liver, heart, and brain. He adopts
the common medieval view that the brain contains three ventricles
devoted respectively to imagination, reason, and memory.
He explains that the so-called <i>incubus</i>, popularly
thought of as a dwarf or satyr who sits on the sleeper, is
really a feeling of suffocation produced by blood-pressure
near the heart. The interpretation of a dream must vary
according to the social rank of the person concerned. As
images in a mirror deceive the ordinary observer but are
readily accounted for by the geometer, and as the philosopher
notes the significations of other planets than the sun
and moon, whose effects alone impress the vulgar herd, so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>
there are dreams which only a skilled interpreter can explain.
Dreams are affected by food and by the humors prevailing
in the body, and also by the occult virtues of gems,
of which a list is given from “Evax” or Marbod.<a id="FNanchor_944" href="#Footnote_944" class="fnanchor">[944]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Interpretation.</div>

<p>The second book takes up again the varying significations
of dreams according to the person concerned, and also
the significance of the time of the dream. The four seasons,
the phases of the moon, nativity of the dreamer, and
hour of the night are discussed. The remaining two-thirds
of the treatise consists in stating the interpretation to be
placed upon the varied persons and things seen in dreams,
beginning with God and Jesus Christ, and continuing with
crucifixes, idols, statues, bells, hell, the resurrection of the
dead, and so on and so forth. Early mention of eunuchs
and icons suggests a Byzantine source. More especially in
the last third of the treatise, various marginal headings
indicate that the interpretations are “according to the Indians”
or “according to the Persians and Egyptians,” which
suggests that use is being made of the work of Achmet or
of Leo Tuscus’ translation thereof.</p>

<div class="sidenote">William
of Aragon
on
prognostication
from
dreams.</div>

<p>The influence of Achmet’s work is also seen in a treatise
on the prognostication of dreams compiled by master William
of Aragon.<a id="FNanchor_945" href="#Footnote_945" class="fnanchor">[945]</a> It opens by referring to the labors in this
art of the ancient philosophers of India, Persia, Egypt, and
Greece, and later it cites Smarchas the Indian,<a id="FNanchor_946" href="#Footnote_946" class="fnanchor">[946]</a> whom I take
to be the same as the Strbachan of Achmet’s second chapter.
William justifies writing his treatise by saying that while
there may be many Dream-Books in existence already, they
are mere <i>Practice</i> and without reason, while he intends to
base the prediction of the future from dreams upon rational
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>
speculation, and to support his particular reasoning by
specific examples.<a id="FNanchor_947" href="#Footnote_947" class="fnanchor">[947]</a> He makes more use of Aristotle’s classification
of dreams<a id="FNanchor_948" href="#Footnote_948" class="fnanchor">[948]</a> than the anonymous work just considered,
from which he further differs in dwelling more upon
the connection of dreams with the constellations.<a id="FNanchor_949" href="#Footnote_949" class="fnanchor">[949]</a> The
second part of his treatise consists of twelve chapters devoted
to the twelve astrological houses.<a id="FNanchor_950" href="#Footnote_950" class="fnanchor">[950]</a> Earlier he mentions
that at the nativity of Alexander an eagle with extended
wings rested all day on the roof of the palace of his
father Philip.<a id="FNanchor_951" href="#Footnote_951" class="fnanchor">[951]</a> In stating the signification of various objects
William has a chapter on what different parts of the
human body signify when seen in dreams.<a id="FNanchor_952" href="#Footnote_952" class="fnanchor">[952]</a> Like our previous
works on divination from dreams, he lays considerable
stress upon experience, illustrating his statement that dreams
are often due to bodily ills by cases which “I have seen,”<a id="FNanchor_953" href="#Footnote_953" class="fnanchor">[953]</a>
and also asserting that it is shown by experience that dreams
seen on the first four days of the week are most quickly
fulfilled.<a id="FNanchor_954" href="#Footnote_954" class="fnanchor">[954]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Who was
William
of
Aragon?</div>

<p>This William of Aragon is no doubt the same who commented
upon the <i>Centiloquium</i> ascribed to Ptolemy.<a id="FNanchor_955" href="#Footnote_955" class="fnanchor">[955]</a> From
his medical experience and his tendency to give an astrological
explanation for everything one is tempted to identify
him further with the William Anglicus or William of Marseilles
who wrote the treatise of astrological medicine entitled,
<i>Of Urine Unseen</i>, in the year 1219, but it is of course
unlikely that the same man would be called of Aragon as
well as of England and Marseilles or that the words
<i>Anglicus</i> and <i>Aragonia</i> should be confused by copyists.</p>

dreams.</div>

<p>In the same manuscript with the <i>Sompniale dilucidarium
Pharaonis</i> and the work of William of Aragon on dreams
just described is another long anonymous work on the interpretation
of dreams.<a id="FNanchor_959" href="#Footnote_959" class="fnanchor">[959]</a> It makes the usual points that the
meaning of dreams varies with times and persons. But the
treatise consists chiefly<a id="FNanchor_960" href="#Footnote_960" class="fnanchor">[960]</a> of a mass of significations which
are not even arranged in alphabetical order, a failing which
it is attempted to remedy by an alphabetical index at the
close.<a id="FNanchor_961" href="#Footnote_961" class="fnanchor">[961]</a></p>

<p>Since this astrological work
mentions Albumasar, while Achmet,
the author of the dream-book,
wrote early in the ninth
century, the editors of the <i>Catalogus</i>
doubt if the two Achmets
are the same, but it should be
noted that in the astrological treatise
Achmet is spoken of in the
third person and that it may be a
re-editing of his original work.
On the other hand, perhaps this
astrological Achmet is Alphraganus,
or Ahmetus filius Ahmeti
(Ameti), as he is often called.</p>

“Danielis somniorum expositoris
veridici libellus incipit.... Ego
sum daniel propheta unus de israhelitis
qui captivi ducti sunt....”</p>

<p><i>Somnia Danielis et Ioseph</i>
(IA.31744), “Omnes prophete
tradebant somnia que videbant in
somniis eorum et solus propheta
Daniel filius Iude qui captus a
rege Nabuchudonosor....” This
is followed by a second treatise
which opens, “Incipiunt somnia
quae composuit Joseph dum captus
erat a rege Pharaone in
egypto....”</p>

<p><i>Interpretationes somniorum
Danielis prophete revelate ab
angelo misso a deo</i> (IA.11607,
and IA.18164 is very similar).</p>

<p>The Incipit in the second edition
is given in more nearly correct
form in Sloane 3281, 13-14th
century, fol. 39r, “Omnes homines
tradebant sompnia que tradebant
(?) ut solveret propheta
daniel....”</p>

<p>Another opening, found in the
MSS, states that the princes of
Babylonia asked the prophet
Daniel to interpret their dreams.
See Digby 86, late 13th century,
fols. 34v-40r, “Daniel propheta
petebatur a principiis civitatis
Babilone ut somnia que eis videbantur
solvere (solveret?). Tunc
sedit et hec omnia scribat (et)
tradidit populo ad legendum.”
The first two lines of interpretation
are:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Arma in somniis portare securitatem significat;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Arcum tendere et sagittas mittere lucrum vel laborem significat.”</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">To draw bow and shoot arrows signifies gain or labor.”)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Bodleian 177 (Bernard 2072),
late 14th century, fol. 64r, opens
somewhat differently, “Danielem
prophetam cum esset in Babilonia
petebant principes,” and its first
two lines of interpretation are:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Aves cum se pugnare videre fecundiam significat;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Aves in sompniis apprehendere lucrum significat.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">

the same hand has written in the

<h2 class="nobreak">BOOK V. THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY</h2>

<h3 id="FOREWORD">FOREWORD</h3>
</div>

<p>In our preceding book on the twelfth century we included
some writers, like Alexander Neckam, who lived on a few
years into the following century but whose works were
probably written in the twelfth. We now, with Michael
Scot, begin to treat of authors whose period of literary productivity
dates after 1200. We shall endeavor to consider
the various authors and works in something like chronological
order, but this is often difficult to determine and in one
or two cases we shall purposely disregard strict chronology
in order to bring works of the same sort together. Our
last four chapters on Arnald of Villanova, Raymond Lull,
Peter of Abano, and Cecco d’Ascoli carry us over the
threshold of the fourteenth century, the death of the last-named
not occurring until 1327.</p>

<p>Greater voluminousness and thoroughness mark the
work of these writers as compared with those of the twelfth
century. The work of translation has been partly accomplished;
that of compilation, reconciliation, criticism, and
further personal investigation and experimentation proceeds
more rapidly and extensively. The new Friar Orders invade
the world of learning as of everything else: of the
writers whose names head the following chapters Bartholomew
of England and Roger Bacon were Franciscans;<a id="FNanchor_962" href="#Footnote_962" class="fnanchor">[962]</a>
Thomas of Cantimpré, Vincent of Beauvais, Albertus Magnus,
and Thomas Aquinas were Dominicans. In these representatives
of the new religious Orders, however, theology
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>
cannot be said to absorb attention at the expense of natural
science. The prohibitions of the study of the works of Aristotle
in the field of natural philosophy by the University of
Paris early in the century preceded the friars and were not
lasting, and the mid-century struggle of the friars with the
other teachers at Paris<a id="FNanchor_963" href="#Footnote_963" class="fnanchor">[963]</a> was one over privilege and organization
rather than tenets. Teachers and writers were, however,
sometimes condemned for their intellectual views at
Paris and elsewhere in the thirteenth century, and whether
the study of natural science and astrology was persecuted
is a question which will arise more than once. In any case
the friars seem to have declined in scientific prowess as in
other respects toward the close of the century. Petrus Hispanus,
who became Pope John XXI in 1276-1277, had not
been a friar himself, and is said to have been more favorable
to men of learning than to the regular clergy. Finally,
in Guido Bonatti, Arnald of Villanova, Peter of Abano, and
Cecco d’Ascoli we come to laymen, physicians and astrologers,
who were to some extent either anti-clerical themselves
or the object of clerical attack.</p>

<p>This was the century in which Roger Bacon launched
his famous eulogy of experimental science. A good-sized
fleet of passages recognizing its importance will be found,
however, in our other authors, and we shall need to devote
two chapters to experimental books which were either
anonymous or pretended to date back to ancient or Arabic
authors. And not without some justification, since we have
been tracing the history of experimental science through
our previous books.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Michael
Scot and
Frederick
II.</div>

<p>But little can be said with certainty concerning the life of
Michael Scot.<a id="FNanchor_964" href="#Footnote_964" class="fnanchor">[964]</a> However, a poem by Henry of Avranches,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>
addressed to the emperor Frederick II in 1235 or 1236,<a id="FNanchor_965" href="#Footnote_965" class="fnanchor">[965]</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>
shows that Michael was then dead and that he apparently
had occupied the position of astrologer at the court of Frederick
II at the time of his death. The poet explains how
astrologers (<i>mathematici</i>) “reveal the secrets of things,”
by their art affecting numbers, by numbers affecting the
procession of the stars, and by the stars moving the universe.
He recalls having heard “certain predictions concerning
you, O Caesar, from Michael Scot who was a scrutinizer
of the stars, an augur, a soothsayer, a second Apollo”;
and then tells how “the truthful diviner Michael” ceased to
publish his secrets to the world, and “the announcer of fates
submitted to fate,” apparently in the midst of some prediction
made on his death-bed. Michael’s own statements also
show that he was one of Frederick’s astrologers.<a id="FNanchor_966" href="#Footnote_966" class="fnanchor">[966]</a> If at
the time of his death Michael was Frederick’s astrologer, it
is more questionable at what date his association with Frederick
began, and in what countries Michael resided with the
emperor, or accompanied him to, whether Sicily, southern
Italy, northern Italy, or Germany. From the fact that three
of Michael Scot’s works, or rather, the three chief divisions
of his longest extant work,<a id="FNanchor_967" href="#Footnote_967" class="fnanchor">[967]</a> namely, <i>Liber Introductorius</i>,
<i>Liber Particularis</i>, and <i>Phisionomia</i>, were written at the
request of Frederick II for beginners<a id="FNanchor_968" href="#Footnote_968" class="fnanchor">[968]</a> and apparently in
the time of Innocent III,<a id="FNanchor_969" href="#Footnote_969" class="fnanchor">[969]</a> J. Wood Brown jumped to the
conclusion that Michael was Frederick’s tutor before that
monarch came of age, and that he spent some time in the
island of Sicily, from which Brown failed to distinguish
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span>
Frederick’s larger kingdom of Sicily.<a id="FNanchor_970" href="#Footnote_970" class="fnanchor">[970]</a> As a matter of fact,
there would seem to be rather more evidence for connecting
Michael with Salerno than with any Sicilian city, since in
one manuscript of his translation for the emperor of the
work of Avicenna on animals he is spoken of as “an astronomer
of Salerno,”<a id="FNanchor_971" href="#Footnote_971" class="fnanchor">[971]</a> while in another manuscript he is associated
with a Philip, clerk of the king of Sicily, and this
royal notary in two deeds of 1200 is called Philip of
Salerno.<a id="FNanchor_972" href="#Footnote_972" class="fnanchor">[972]</a> Brown was inclined to identify him further with
Philip of Tripoli, the translator of the pseudo-Aristotelian
<i>Secret of Secrets</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Some
dates in
Michael’s
career.</div>

<p>No date in Michael’s career before the thirteenth century
is fixed. If it is true that the three sections of his main work
were written under Innocent III, that places them between
1198 and 1216. The date of his translation of the astronomical
work of Alpetragius or Alpetrangi (Nûr ed-din
el-Betrûgî, Abû Ishâq) seems to have been in the year 1217
on Friday, August 18, in the third hour and at Toledo.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span><a id="FNanchor_973" href="#Footnote_973" class="fnanchor">[973]</a>
Brown holds that Michael translated Avicenna on animals
in 1210 for Frederick II and that the emperor kept it to
himself until 1232, when he allowed Henry of Cologne to
copy it.<a id="FNanchor_974" href="#Footnote_974" class="fnanchor">[974]</a> But the date 1210 perhaps applies only to a glossary
of Arabic terms which accompanies the work and
which is ascribed to a “Master Al.”<a id="FNanchor_975" href="#Footnote_975" class="fnanchor">[975]</a> In a thirteenth century
manuscript at Cambridge Michael Scot’s translation of
Aristotle’s <i>History of Animals</i> is accompanied by a note
which begins, “And I Michael Scot who translated this book
into Latin swear that in the year 1221 on Wednesday, October
twenty-first.”<a id="FNanchor_976" href="#Footnote_976" class="fnanchor">[976]</a> The note and date, however, do not
refer to the completion of the translation but to a consultation
in which a woman showed him two stones like eggs
which came from another woman’s womb and of which he
gives a painstakingly detailed description. There is, however,
something wrong with the date, since in 1221 the
twenty-first of October fell on Thursday.<a id="FNanchor_977" href="#Footnote_977" class="fnanchor">[977]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Michael
Scot
and the
papacy.</div>

<p>The career of Michael Scot affords an especially good
illustration of how little likelihood there was of anyone’s
being persecuted by the medieval church for belief in or
practice of astrology. Michael, although subordinating the
stars to God and admitting human free will, as we shall
see, both believed in the possibility of astrological prediction
and made such predictions himself. Yet he was a
clergyman, perhaps even a doctor of theology,<a id="FNanchor_978" href="#Footnote_978" class="fnanchor">[978]</a> as well as a
court astrologer, and furthermore was a clergyman of sufficient
rank and prominence to enable Pope Honorius III to
procure in 1224 his election to the archbishopric of Cashel
in Ireland.<a id="FNanchor_979" href="#Footnote_979" class="fnanchor">[979]</a> At the same time the papal <i>curia</i> issued a dispensation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span>
permitting Michael to hold a plurality, so that he
evidently already occupied some desirable benefice. Michael
declined the archbishopric of Cashel, on the ground that
he was ignorant of the native language but perhaps because
he preferred a position in England; for we find the papacy
renewing its efforts in his behalf, and Gregory IX on April
28, 1227, again wrote to Stephen Langton, archbishop of
Canterbury, urging him to make provision for “master
Michael Scot,” whom he characterized as “well instructed
not only in Latin but also in the Hebrew and Arabic languages.”<a id="FNanchor_980" href="#Footnote_980" class="fnanchor">[980]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Prominent
position in
the world
of learning.</div>

<p>Whether Michael ever secured the additional foreign
benefice or not, he seems to have remained in Italy with
Frederick until the end of his days. He also seems to have
continued prominent among men of learning, since in 1228
Leonardo of Pisa dedicated to him the revised and enlarged
version of his <i>Liber abaci</i>,<a id="FNanchor_981" href="#Footnote_981" class="fnanchor">[981]</a> important in connection with
the introduction of the Hindu-Arabic numerals into western
Europe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Relation
to the introduction
of the new
Aristotle.</div>

<p>Roger Bacon in the <i>Opus Maius</i><a id="FNanchor_982" href="#Footnote_982" class="fnanchor">[982]</a> in a passage often
cited by historians of medieval thought ascribes the introduction
of the new Aristotle into western Latin Christendom
to Michael Scot who, he says, appeared in 1230 A. D. with
portions of the works of Aristotle in natural philosophy and
metaphysics. Before his time there were only the works
on logic and a few others translated by Boethius from the
Greek; since 1230 the philosophy of Aristotle “has been
magnified among the Latins.” Although many writers have
quoted this statement as authoritative in one way or another,
it must now be regarded as valuable only as one more illustration
of the loose and misleading character of most of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span>
Roger’s allusions to past learning and to the work of previous
translators. We know that the books of Aristotle on
natural philosophy had become so well known by that time
that in 1210 the study of them was forbidden at the university
of Paris, and that about that same year, according
to Rigord’s chronicle of the reign of Philip II, the books
of Metaphysics of Aristotle were brought from Constantinople,
translated from Greek into Latin, and began to be
read at Paris.<a id="FNanchor_983" href="#Footnote_983" class="fnanchor">[983]</a> But Bacon’s date is more than twenty years
too late, and we have already mentioned the translation of
<i>The Secret of Secrets</i>, which Bacon regarded as genuine, the
acquaintance of Alexander Neckam with works of Aristotle,
Alfred of England’s translation of the <i>De vegetabilibus</i>
and of three additional chapters to the <i>Meteorology</i>,
the still earlier translation of the rest of that work by
Aristippus from the Greek and by Gerard of Cremona from
the Arabic, and Gerard’s numerous other translations of
works of Aristotle in natural philosophy. The translations
of Gerard and Aristippus take us back to the middle of the
twelfth century nearly a century before the date set by
Bacon for the introduction of the new Aristotle.<a id="FNanchor_984" href="#Footnote_984" class="fnanchor">[984]</a> Michael
Scot, then, did not introduce the works of Aristotle on natural
science and Bacon’s chronological recollections are
obviously too faulty for us to accept the date 1230 as of any
exact significance in even Michael’s own career, to say nothing
of the history of the translation of Aristotle.</p>

<p>This is not to say that Michael was not of some importance
in that process, since he did translate works of Aristotle
and his Arabic commentators, especially Avicenna and
Averroes. Frederick II is sometimes said to have ordered
the translation from Greek and Arabic of such works of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span>
Aristotle and other philosophers as had not yet been translated
from Greek or Arabic.<a id="FNanchor_985" href="#Footnote_985" class="fnanchor">[985]</a> But the letter which has been
ascribed in this connection to Frederick is really by his son
and successor, Manfred,<a id="FNanchor_986" href="#Footnote_986" class="fnanchor">[986]</a> for whom many translations were
made, including several Aristotelian treatises, genuine and
spurious, by Bartholomew of Messina. Already, however,
in 1231 and 1232 a Jew at Naples had translated Averroes’
abridgement of the <i>Almagest</i> and his commentary on the
<i>Organon</i>, in the latter extolling Frederick’s munificence
and love of science.<a id="FNanchor_987" href="#Footnote_987" class="fnanchor">[987]</a> Michael Scot has been shown to have
translated from the Arabic the <i>History of Animals</i> and
other works on animals, making nineteen books in all, and
also Avicenna’s compendium of the same, the <i>De caelo et
mundo</i>, the <i>De anima</i> with the commentary of Averroes,
and perhaps the <i>Metaphysics</i> or part of it.<a id="FNanchor_988" href="#Footnote_988" class="fnanchor">[988]</a> His translation
of the <i>De caelo et mundo</i> was accompanied by a translation
of Alpetrangi’s commentary on the same.<a id="FNanchor_989" href="#Footnote_989" class="fnanchor">[989]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Thirteenth
century
criticism
of Michael
Scot.</div>

<p>Scholars of the succeeding generation sometimes spoke
unfavorably of Michael’s work. Although Roger Bacon
recognized his translations as the central event in the Latin
reception of the Aristotelian philosophy, and spoke of him
as “a notable inquirer into matter, motion, and the course
of the constellations,”<a id="FNanchor_990" href="#Footnote_990" class="fnanchor">[990]</a> he listed him among those translators
who “understood neither sciences nor languages, not
even Latin,” and charged more than once that a Jew named
Andrew was really responsible for the translations credited
to Michael.<a id="FNanchor_991" href="#Footnote_991" class="fnanchor">[991]</a> Albertus Magnus asserted that Michael Scot
“in reality was ignorant concerning nature and did not understand
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span>
the books of Aristotle well.”<a id="FNanchor_992" href="#Footnote_992" class="fnanchor">[992]</a> Yet he used
Michael’s translation of the <i>Historia Animalium</i> as the
basis of his own work on the subject, often following it word
for word.<a id="FNanchor_993" href="#Footnote_993" class="fnanchor">[993]</a> Michael was, however, listed or cited as an
authority by the thirteenth century encyclopedists, Thomas
of Cantimpré, Bartholomew of England, Vincent of Beauvais,
and at the close of that century is frequently cited by
the physician Arnald of Villanova in his <i>Breviarium practicae</i>.<a id="FNanchor_994" href="#Footnote_994" class="fnanchor">[994]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">General
estimate
of his
learning.</div>

<p>Michael Scot may be said to manifest some of the failings
of the learning of his time in a rather excessive degree.
His mind, curious, credulous, and uncritical, seems to have
collected a mass of undigested information and superstition
with little regard to consistency or system. Occasionally
he includes the most childish and naïve sort of material, as
we shall illustrate later. He continues the Isidorean type
of etymology, deriving the name of the month of May, for
example, either from the majesty of Jupiter, or from the
major chiefs of Rome who in that month were wont to
dedicate laws to Jupiter, or from the <i>maioribus</i> in the sense
of elders as June is derived from Juniors.<a id="FNanchor_995" href="#Footnote_995" class="fnanchor">[995]</a> He also well
illustrates the puerilities and crudities of scholastic argumentation.
Thus one of the arguments which he lists
against regarding a sphere as a solid body is that solids can
be measured by a straight line and that it cannot.<a id="FNanchor_996" href="#Footnote_996" class="fnanchor">[996]</a> Asking
whether fire is hot in its own sphere, he says that it might
seem not, because fire in its own sphere is light and light
is neither hot nor cold.<a id="FNanchor_997" href="#Footnote_997" class="fnanchor">[997]</a> This argument he rebuts in the
end, and he finally decides that a sphere is a solid. But
he would have seemed wiser to the modern reader to have
omitted these particular contrary arguments entirely. Such
propositions continue, however, to be set up and knocked
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>
down again all through the thirteenth century, and such
famous men as Thomas Aquinas and Peter of Abano are
guilty of much the same sort of thing. To Michael Scot’s
credit may be mentioned his considerable power of experimentation
and of scientific observation. Perhaps some of
the “experiments” attributed to him are spurious, but they
show the reputation which he had for experimental method,
and on the whole it would seem to be justified. The note
in his name in a thirteenth century manuscript at Cambridge,<a id="FNanchor_998" href="#Footnote_998" class="fnanchor">[998]</a>
giving a carefully dated and detailed account of two
human foetuses which had solidified into stones like eggs,
shows a keen sense of the value of thorough observation
and a precise record of the same. Experimental science
would seem to have received considerable encouragement at
the court of Frederick II, judging from the stories told of
that emperor and the pages of his own work on falconry.<a id="FNanchor_999" href="#Footnote_999" class="fnanchor">[999]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">God and
the stars.</div>

<p>But let us examine Michael’s views and methods more
particularly. In opening the long preface to his voluminous
<i>Introduction to Astrology</i> he states that hard study is
requisite to become a good astrologer, but he finds incentive
to such effort in citations from Seneca, Cato, and St. Bernard
that it is virtuous to study and to be taught, and in
the reflection that one who knows the conditions and
habitudes of the superior bodies can easily learn those of
inferior bodies. The signs and planets are not first movers
or first causes, and do not of themselves confer aught of
good or evil, but by their motion do indicate “something of
truth concerning every body produced in this corruptible
world.” The hour of conception is important and Michael
explains why two persons born at the same moment may be
unlike. He then jumbles together from Christian and astrological
writers such assertions as that the stars are only
signs, not causes, and that their influence on inferior creation
may be compared to the action of the magnet upon iron,
or that we see on earth good men suffer and bad men prosper,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span>
which has usually been regarded as a better argument
for a fatalistic or mechanical universe than for divine control.
He agrees that the universe is not eternal and that
everything is in God’s power, but insists that much can be
learned concerning the future from the stars.<a id="FNanchor_1000" href="#Footnote_1000" class="fnanchor">[1000]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">A theological
digression.</div>

<p>Michael then embarks upon a long theological digression<a id="FNanchor_1001" href="#Footnote_1001" class="fnanchor">[1001]</a>
in the course of which he quotes much Scripture concerning
the two natures, angelic and human. After telling
us of the nine orders of angels in the empyrean heaven, he
deals with the process of creation, just as William of
Conches and Daniel of Morley had done in their works of
astronomy and astrology. In the first three days God
created spiritual substances such as the empyrean heaven,
angels, stars, and planets; in the other three days, visible
bodies such as mixtures of the elements, birds, fish, and
man. Michael also answers various questions such as why
man was created last, although nobler than other creatures,
what an angel is, whether angels have individual names like
men, and much concerning the tenth part who fell. Perhaps
the emperor Frederick is supposed to put these queries to
Michael, but there seemed to be no indication to that effect
in the manuscript which I examined. The reply to the
question where God resides is, potentially everywhere but
substantially in the intellectual or empyrean heaven.<a id="FNanchor_1002" href="#Footnote_1002" class="fnanchor">[1002]</a>
Michael discusses the holy Trinity and thinks that we have
a similitude of it in the rational soul in the three faculties,
intellect, reason, and memory,<a id="FNanchor_1003" href="#Footnote_1003" class="fnanchor">[1003]</a> although he attempts no
association of these with the three Persons as William of
Conches imprudently did in the case of power, wisdom, and
will. He indulges, however, in daring speculation as to
where the members of different professions will go after they
die. Philosophers, “who die in the Lord,” will be located
in the order of Cherubim, which is interpreted as plenitude
of science; sincere members of religious orders and hermits
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span>
will become Seraphim; while pope, emperor, cardinals, and
prelates will enter the order of Thrones.<a id="FNanchor_1004" href="#Footnote_1004" class="fnanchor">[1004]</a> Michael also contributes
the following acrostic of eight sins whose initials
compose the word, “Diabolus”:</p>

<ul><li>Desperatio</li>
<li>Invidia</li>
<li>Avaritia</li>
<li>Blasphemia</li>
<li>Odium</li>
<li>Luxuria</li>
<li>Ventris ingluvies</li>
<li>Superbia.<a id="FNanchor_1005" href="#Footnote_1005" class="fnanchor">[1005]</a></li>
</ul>

<div class="sidenote">The three
Magi.</div>

<p>In the course of the foregoing digression Michael inserted
an account of the Magi and the star that appears to
be based in part but with variations on the spurious homily
of Chrysostom. He makes them three in number, one
from Europe, Asia, and Africa respectively; and states that
forewarned by Balaam’s prophecy they met together annually
for worship on the day of Christ’s nativity, which
they appear to have known beforehand. They stood in
adoration for three days continuously on Mount Victorialis
until on the third day they saw the star in the form of a
most beautiful boy with a crown on his head. Then they
followed the star upon dromedaries which, Michael explains,
can go farther in a day than horses can in two months.
Beside the star three suns arose that day at equal distances
apart and then united in token of the Trinity; and Octavianus,
emperor of the Romans, saw the Virgin holding the
Child in the center of the sun’s disk. As for the word
<i>magus</i>, Michael explains that it has a threefold meaning,&mdash;which,
however, has nothing to do with the Trinity,&mdash;namely:
trickster, sorcerer, and wise man, and that the Magi
who saw the star were all three of these until their subsequent
conversion to Christianity.<a id="FNanchor_1006" href="#Footnote_1006" class="fnanchor">[1006]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Astrology
distinguished
from
magic.</div>

<p>The remainder of Michael’s lengthy and lumbering
preface is largely occupied with the utility of astrology,
which he often calls “astronomy” (<i>astronomia</i>), and differentiation
of it from prohibited arts of magic and divination.
While, however, he distinguishes these other occult
arts from astrology, he affirms that nigromancers, practitioners
of the notory art, and alchemists owe more to the
stars than they are ready to admit.<a id="FNanchor_1007" href="#Footnote_1007" class="fnanchor">[1007]</a> He also distinguishes
a superstitious variety of astrology (<i>superstitiosa astronomia</i>),<a id="FNanchor_1008" href="#Footnote_1008" class="fnanchor">[1008]</a>
under which caption he seems to have in mind
divination from the letters of persons’ names and the days
of the moon, and other methods in which the astronomer or
astrologer acts like a geomancer or sorcerer or tries to find
out more than God wills. Scot also distinguishes between
<i>mathesis</i>, or knowledge, and <i>matesis</i>, or divination, and between
<i>mathematica</i>, which may be taught freely and publicly,
and <i>matematica</i>, which is forbidden to Christians.<a id="FNanchor_1009" href="#Footnote_1009" class="fnanchor">[1009]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The magic
arts.</div>

<p>Michael condemns magic and necromancy but takes evident
joy in telling stories of magicians and necromancers
and shows much familiarity with books of magic. He explains
“nigromancy” as black art, dealing with dark things
and performed more by night than day, as well as the raising
of the dead to give responses, in which the nigromancer is
deceived by demons.<a id="FNanchor_1010" href="#Footnote_1010" class="fnanchor">[1010]</a> He repeats Hugh of St. Victor’s
definition that the magic art is not received in philosophy,
destroys religion, and corrupts morals. As he has said before,
the <i>magus</i> is a trickster and evil-doer as well as wise
in the secrets of nature and in prediction of the future.<a id="FNanchor_1011" href="#Footnote_1011" class="fnanchor">[1011]</a>
Michael lists twenty-eight varieties or methods of divination.
He believes that they are all true: augury by song
of birds, interpretation of dreams, observance of days, or
divination by holocausts of blood and corpses. But they
are forbidden as infamous and evil. Later on, in the text
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span>
itself, he returns to this point, saying that these methods
of predicting the future are against the Christian Faith, but
nevertheless true, like the marvels of Simon Magus.<a id="FNanchor_1012" href="#Footnote_1012" class="fnanchor">[1012]</a>
Michael defines and describes various magic arts in much the
same manner as Isidore, Hugh of St. Victor, and John of
Salisbury; but with some divergences. Under aerimancy he
includes divination from thunder, comets, and falling stars,
as well as from the shapes assumed by clouds. Hydromancy
he calls “a short art of experimenting” as well as divining.
The gazing into clear, transparent, or liquid surfaces for
purposes of divination is performed, he says, with some
observance of astrological hours, secrecy, and purity by a
child of five or seven years who repeats after the master an
incantation or invocation of spirits over human blood or
bones. He speaks of a <i>maleficus</i> as one who interprets characters,
phylacteries, incantations, dreams, and makes ligatures
of herbs. The <i>praestigiosus</i> deceives men through
diabolic art by phantastic illusions of transformation, such
as changing a woman into a dog or bear, making a man
appear a wolf or ass, or causing a human head or limb to
resemble that of some animal. Even alchemy, or perhaps
only the superstitious practice of it, Michael seems to classify
as a forbidden magic art, saying, “Alchemy as it were transcends
the heavens in that it strives by the virtue of spirits
to transmute common metals into gold and silver and from
them to make a water of much diversity,” that is, an elixir.
Lot-casting, on the other hand, both the authority of Augustine
and many passages in the Bible pronounce licit.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Experiments
of
magic.</div>

<p>Michael more than once ascribes an experimental character
to magic arts. Besides calling hydromancy “a short
art of experimenting,” he states that, since demons are
naturally fond of blood and especially human blood, nigromancers
or magicians, when they wish to perform experiments,
often mix water with real blood or use wine which
has been exorcized in order to make it appear bloody. “And
they make some sacrifice with the flesh of a living human
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span>
being, for instance, a bit of their own flesh, or of a corpse,
and not the flesh of brutes, knowing that consecration of a
spirit in a bottle or ring cannot be achieved except by the
performance of many sacrifices.”<a id="FNanchor_1013" href="#Footnote_1013" class="fnanchor">[1013]</a> Despite his censure of
the art in the preface under discussion, we find a necromantic
experiment of an elaborate character ascribed to Michael
Scot in a fifteenth century manuscript<a id="FNanchor_1014" href="#Footnote_1014" class="fnanchor">[1014]</a> which purports to
copy it “from a very ancient book,”<a id="FNanchor_1015" href="#Footnote_1015" class="fnanchor">[1015]</a> a phrase which scarcely
increases our confidence in the genuineness of the ascription.
The object of the experiment is to secure the services of a
demon to instruct one in learning. Times and astrological
conditions are to be observed as well as various other preliminaries
and ceremonies; a white dove is to be beheaded,
its blood collected in a glass vessel, a magic circle drawn with
its bleeding heart; and various prayers to God, invocations
of spirits, and verses of the Bible are to be repeated. At
one juncture, however, one is warned <i>not</i> to make the sign
of the cross or one will be in great peril.</p>

<div class="sidenote">History
of astronomy.</div>

<p>But to return to Michael’s <i>magnum opus</i>. The preface
closes with a rather long and very confused<a id="FNanchor_1016" href="#Footnote_1016" class="fnanchor">[1016]</a> account of the
history of astronomy and astrology. While Zoroaster of
the lineage of Shem was the inventor of magic, the arts of
divination began with Cham, the son of Noah, who was
both of most subtle genius and trained in the schools of
the demons. He tested by experience what they taught him
and having proved what was true, indited the same on two
columns and taught it to his son Canaan who soon outstripped
his father therein and wrote thirty volumes on
the arts of divination and instructed his son Nemroth in
the same. When Canaan was slain in war and his books
were burned, Nemroth revived the art of astronomy from
memory and was, like his father, deemed a god by many
because of his great lore. He composed a work on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span>
subject for his son Ionicon,<a id="FNanchor_1017" href="#Footnote_1017" class="fnanchor">[1017]</a> whose son Abraham also became
an adept in the art and came from Africa to Jerusalem
and taught Demetrius and Alexander of Alexandria, who
in turn instructed Ptolemy, king of Egypt, who invented
astronomical canons and tables and the astrolabe and quadrant.
The giant Atlas brought the art to Spain before Moses
received the two tables containing the ten commandments.
If this chronology surprises us, there is something more
amazing to follow. At this point in the manuscript the
copyist has either omitted a great deal<a id="FNanchor_1018" href="#Footnote_1018" class="fnanchor">[1018]</a> or Atlas was extremely
long-lived, since we next read about his showing
the astrolabe to two “clerks of France.” Gilbertus (presumably
Gerbert) borrowed the instrument for a while,
conjured up demons&mdash;for he was the best nigromancer in
France, made them explain its construction, uses, and operation
to him, and furthermore all the rest of astronomy.
Later he reformed and had no more dealing with demons
and became bishop of Ravenna and Pope. Having thus got
rather ahead of time, Michael mentions various other learned
astronomers, most of whom really lived before Gerbert,
such as Thebit ben Corat, Messahalla, Dorotheus, Hermes,
Boethius, Averroes, John of Spain, Isidore, Zahel, and
Alcabitius.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The spirits
in the sky,
air, and
earth.</div>

<p>Having finally terminated his preface, Michael begins
the first book with a description of the heavens and their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span>
motion. Some say that the planets are moved by angels;
others, by winds; but he holds that they are ruled by divine
virtues, spiritual and not corporeal, but of whom little
further can be predicated, since they are imperfectly known
to man and naturally will remain so.<a id="FNanchor_1019" href="#Footnote_1019" class="fnanchor">[1019]</a> Later he states that
they do not move or rule the celestial bodies naturally but
as a service of obedience to their Creator.<a id="FNanchor_1020" href="#Footnote_1020" class="fnanchor">[1020]</a> He has already
spoken in the preface of spirits in the northern and southern
air, and asserted that very wise spirits who give responses
when conjured dwell in certain images or constellations
among the signs of the zodiac.<a id="FNanchor_1021" href="#Footnote_1021" class="fnanchor">[1021]</a> In the <i>Liber particularis</i>
he speaks of similar demons in the moon.<a id="FNanchor_1022" href="#Footnote_1022" class="fnanchor">[1022]</a> Now he
mentions “a legion of spirits damned” in the winds.<a id="FNanchor_1023" href="#Footnote_1023" class="fnanchor">[1023]</a> In
later passages in the <i>Liber introductorius</i> he gives the names
of the ruling spirits of the planets, Kathariel for Saturn,<a id="FNanchor_1024" href="#Footnote_1024" class="fnanchor">[1024]</a>
and so on, and a list of the names of spirits of great virtue
who, if invoked by name, will respond readily and perform
in marvelous wise all that may be demanded of them.<a id="FNanchor_1025" href="#Footnote_1025" class="fnanchor">[1025]</a>
And as the planets are said to have seven rectors who are
believed to be the wisest spirits in the sky, so the seven
metals are said to have seven rectors who are believed to
be angels in the earth.<a id="FNanchor_1026" href="#Footnote_1026" class="fnanchor">[1026]</a> Names of angels also occur in
some of his astrological diagrams.<a id="FNanchor_1027" href="#Footnote_1027" class="fnanchor">[1027]</a> This education of the
reader in details of astrological necromancy shows that
Michael is not to be depended upon to observe consistently
the condemnation of magic and distinction between astrology
and necromancy with which he started out in the
preface.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Occult
medicine.</div>

<p>By affirming that the physician must know the state of
the moon and of the wind and that “there are many passions
of the soul under the sphere of the moon,”<a id="FNanchor_1028" href="#Footnote_1028" class="fnanchor">[1028]</a> Michael
introduces us to the subject of astrological medicine, a
theme to which he returns more than once in the course
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span>
of the work.<a id="FNanchor_1029" href="#Footnote_1029" class="fnanchor">[1029]</a> The practice of flebotomy is illustrated by a
figure showing the influence of the signs of the zodiac upon
the human body.<a id="FNanchor_1030" href="#Footnote_1030" class="fnanchor">[1030]</a> From the fact that there are fourteen
joints in the fingers of the hand or toes of the foot Michael
infers that man’s span of life should be 140 years, a maximum
which sin has reduced to 120.<a id="FNanchor_1031" href="#Footnote_1031" class="fnanchor">[1031]</a> There are as many
medicines as there are diseases and these consist in the
virtues of words, herbs, and stones, as illustrations of which
Michael adduces the sacrament of the altar, the magnet and
iron used by deep-sea sailors, and plasters and powders.<a id="FNanchor_1032" href="#Footnote_1032" class="fnanchor">[1032]</a>
In some cases, however, neither medicine nor astrology
seems to avail, and, despite his preliminary condemnation
of the magic arts, Michael argues that when the doctor can
do nothing for the patient he should advise him to consult
an enchantress or diviner.<a id="FNanchor_1033" href="#Footnote_1033" class="fnanchor">[1033]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The seven
regions of
the air.</div>

<p>From the seven planets and sphere of the moon Michael
turns to the seven regions of the air, which are respectively
the regions of dew, snow, hail, rain, honey, laudanum, and
manna.<a id="FNanchor_1034" href="#Footnote_1034" class="fnanchor">[1034]</a> This is the earliest occurrence of this discussion
which I have met, and I do not know from what source, if
any, Michael took it. It is essentially repeated by Thomas
of Cantimpré in his <i>De natura rerum</i>, where he gives no
credit to Michael Scot but cites Aristotle’s <i>Meteorology</i> in
which, however, only dew, snow, rain, and hail are discussed.
In the <i>History of Animals</i><a id="FNanchor_1035" href="#Footnote_1035" class="fnanchor">[1035]</a> Aristotle further states
that honey is distilled from the air by the action of the
stars and that the bees make only the wax. Michael similarly
describes the honey as falling from the air into flowers
and herbs and being collected by the bees; but he distinguishes
two kinds of honey, the natural variety just described
and the artificial honey which results from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span>
bee’s process of digestion. He also explains that sugar
(and molasses?) is not a liquor which will evaporate like
honey and manna, but is made from the pith of canes.<a id="FNanchor_1036" href="#Footnote_1036" class="fnanchor">[1036]</a>
“Laudanum” is a humor of the air in the Orient, and
manna descends mainly in India with the dew, being found
in Europe only in times of great heat. It is of great virtue,
both medicinal and in satisfying hunger, as in the case of
the children of Israel under Moses.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Michael’s
miscellaneous
content.</div>

<p>We cannot take the time to follow Michael in all his
long ramblings through things in heaven above and earth
beneath: sun, tides, springs, seasons, the difference between
<i>stella</i>, <i>aster</i>, <i>sidus</i>, <i>signum</i>, <i>imago</i>, and <i>planeta</i>, the music
of the spheres, the octave in music, eight parts of speech in
grammar, and eight beatitudes in theology, zones and
paradise, galaxy and horizon and zenith, divisions of time,
the four inferior elements and the creatures contained in
them, eclipses of sun and moon, Adam protoplasm and
<i>minor mundus</i> as the letters of his name indicate, the
mutable and transitory nature of this world, the inferno in
the earth, and purgatory.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Further
astrological
doctrine.</div>

<p>Sooner or later Michael comes to or returns to astrological
doctrine and technique, lists the qualities of the
seven planets and head and tail of the dragon,<a id="FNanchor_1037" href="#Footnote_1037" class="fnanchor">[1037]</a> explains the
names and some of the effects of the signs of the zodiac,<a id="FNanchor_1038" href="#Footnote_1038" class="fnanchor">[1038]</a>

the moon’s influence in such matters as felling trees and

aspects, exaltations, and conjunctions,<a id="FNanchor_1041" href="#Footnote_1041" class="fnanchor">[1041]</a> friendships
and enmities.<a id="FNanchor_1042" href="#Footnote_1042" class="fnanchor">[1042]</a> The planet Mercury signifies in regard to
the rational soul, grammar, arithmetic, and every science.<a id="FNanchor_1043" href="#Footnote_1043" class="fnanchor">[1043]</a>
The election of hours is considered and a list given of what
to do and not to do in the hour of each planet and that of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span>
the moon in each sign.<a id="FNanchor_1044" href="#Footnote_1044" class="fnanchor">[1044]</a> There then follows, despite
Michael’s animadversions in the preface against interpreters
of dreams and those observing days, an “Exposition of
dreams for each day of the moon,”<a id="FNanchor_1045" href="#Footnote_1045" class="fnanchor">[1045]</a> nativities for each day
of the week, and a method of divination from the day
of the week on which the New Year falls.<a id="FNanchor_1046" href="#Footnote_1046" class="fnanchor">[1046]</a> A discussion
of the effect of the moon upon conception is interrupted by
a digression on eggs: how to estimate the laying power of
a hen by the color and size of its crest, the effect of thunder
upon eggs, how from eggs to make a water of great value
in alchemy, and how to purify bad wine with the white of an
egg.<a id="FNanchor_1047" href="#Footnote_1047" class="fnanchor">[1047]</a> Returning again to the moon, we are told that in
the new moon intellects are livelier, scholars study and professors
teach better, and all artisans work harder. Michael
Scot used to say to the emperor Frederick that if he wished
clear counsel from a wise man, he should consult him in a
waxing moon and in a human and fiery or aerial sign of
the zodiac.<a id="FNanchor_1048" href="#Footnote_1048" class="fnanchor">[1048]</a> Michael had spoken earlier of the planets as
judges of the varied questions of litigators,<a id="FNanchor_1049" href="#Footnote_1049" class="fnanchor">[1049]</a> and now, although
admitting the freedom of the human will, he proceeds
to discuss at considerable length<a id="FNanchor_1050" href="#Footnote_1050" class="fnanchor">[1050]</a> the art of interrogations
by which the astrologer answers questions put to him.
With this the Bodleian manuscript of the <i>Liber introductorius</i>
ends, apparently incomplete.<a id="FNanchor_1051" href="#Footnote_1051" class="fnanchor">[1051]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Omission
of nativities.</div>

<p>In the marginal gloss accompanying a Latin translation
of the astrological works of Abraham Avenezra in a manuscript
of the fifteenth century<a id="FNanchor_1052" href="#Footnote_1052" class="fnanchor">[1052]</a> Michael Scot is quoted a
good deal on the subject of nativities. But the <i>Liber introductorius</i>,
or at least as much of it as appears in the
Bodleian manuscript, contains little upon this side of astrology,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span>
except the brief nativities for each day of the
week. A passage quoted by Brown<a id="FNanchor_1053" href="#Footnote_1053" class="fnanchor">[1053]</a> to the effect that the
person born under a certain sign will be an adept in experiments
and incantations, in coercing spirits and working
marvels, and will be an alchemist and nigromancer, appears
in the manuscript as a marginal addition rather than part
of the text and so is presumably not by Michael Scot himself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Magic for
every
hour.</div>

<p>In connection with the subject of elections Michael gives
a list of the prayers, conjurations, and images appropriate
for each of the twelve hours of the day and of the night.<a id="FNanchor_1054" href="#Footnote_1054" class="fnanchor">[1054]</a>
For instance, in the first hour of the day men pray to God
and it is a good time to bind all tongues by images, characters,
and conjurations. In the second hour angels pray
to God and images and other devices to promote love and
concord should be constructed then. In the third hour birds
and fishes pray to God and it is a good time to make images
and other contrivances to catch birds and fish. In the first
hour of the night demons hold colloquy with their lord and
the time is favorable for the invocation of spirits.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Quaint
religious
science.</div>

<p>A more Christian and less magical enumeration of the
hours occurs in the <i>Liber particularis</i>.<a id="FNanchor_1055" href="#Footnote_1055" class="fnanchor">[1055]</a> At morning Christ
was arrested on the Mount of Olives. In the first hour
Christ was presented to Ananias and Caiaphas, the high
priests; in the third hour, to Pontius Pilate; in the sixth
hour He was brought back to Herod and taken to Mount
Calvary; in the ninth He was given vinegar and gave up
the ghost and the earth quaked and the veil of the temple
was rent in twain; at vespers He was taken down from the
cross. Another specimen of this quaint religious science
is found in the <i>Liber introductorius</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1056" href="#Footnote_1056" class="fnanchor">[1056]</a> where Michael, writing
before the invention of the telescope, speaks of the
limits set to seeing into the heavens except by special grace
of God, as in the case of Katherine and of Stephen, the first
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span>
martyr, who, when stoned, saw the heavens opened. A third
example occurs in the third part of the <i>opus magnum</i>, or
<i>Phisionomia</i>, where it is stated that at birth a male child
cries “Oa” and a female child “Oe,” as if to say respectively,
“O Adam (or, O Eve) why have you sinned that I on your
account must suffer infinite misery?”<a id="FNanchor_1057" href="#Footnote_1057" class="fnanchor">[1057]</a> In the same work
Michael gives original sin as one of two reasons why a
baby cannot talk and walk as soon as it is born.<a id="FNanchor_1058" href="#Footnote_1058" class="fnanchor">[1058]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The <i>Phisionomia</i>.</div>

<p>The third part of Scot’s main work, and the only section
which has been printed, is that primarily devoted to the
pseudo-science of physiognomy, which endeavors to determine
a man’s character from signs furnished by the various
parts of his body. The <i>Phisionomia</i><a id="FNanchor_1059" href="#Footnote_1059" class="fnanchor">[1059]</a> is addressed to the
Emperor Frederick II who is exhorted to the pursuit of
learning in general and the science of physiognomy in particular.
This is probably a conscious or unconscious imitation
of the remarks addressed to Alexander by the Pseudo-Aristotle
in <i>The Secret of Secrets</i>, of which also a considerable
portion is devoted to physiognomy, and from which
Rasis and Michael borrowed a good deal.<a id="FNanchor_1060" href="#Footnote_1060" class="fnanchor">[1060]</a> Indeed, the
<i>Phisionomia</i> of Michael Scot is also often entitled <i>De
secretis naturae</i> and really only a certain portion of it is
devoted exclusively to physiognomy proper. Its early chapters
and first part deal rather with the process of generation
and it is only with the twenty-third chapter and second part
that Michael “reverts to the doctrine of physiognomy.”
Perhaps these chapters on generation had more to do with
the popularity and frequent printing of the work than did
those on physiognomy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Influence
of the
stars on
human
generation.</div>

<p>In this discussion of the process of human generation
the influence of the stars receives ample recognition.
Michael regards the moment of conception as of great astrological
importance; then according to the course of the
stars and the disposition of the bodies conceiving the foetus
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</span>
receives “similarly and simultaneously” each and all of the
determining factors in its subsequent nature and history.<a id="FNanchor_1061" href="#Footnote_1061" class="fnanchor">[1061]</a>
This we may perhaps regard as a medieval approach to the
theory of Mendel. Michael further urges every woman to
note the exact moment of sexual intercourse, when this is
to result in generation, and so make astrological judgment
easy.<a id="FNanchor_1062" href="#Footnote_1062" class="fnanchor">[1062]</a> Yet he states later that God gives a new and free
soul with the new body, just as a father might give his son
a new tablet on which to write whatever he wills of good or
evil.<a id="FNanchor_1063" href="#Footnote_1063" class="fnanchor">[1063]</a> He notes the correspondence of the menstrual fluid
to the waxing and waning of the moon and that planet’s
influence during the seventh month of the formation of
the child in the womb,<a id="FNanchor_1064" href="#Footnote_1064" class="fnanchor">[1064]</a> and gives the usual account of the
babe’s chances of life or death according as it is born within
seven months, or during the eighth, or ninth, or tenth
month. It is not quite clear if it is because there are seven
planets that Michael affirms that a woman can bear as many
as seven children at once.<a id="FNanchor_1065" href="#Footnote_1065" class="fnanchor">[1065]</a> He adds that in this case the
child conceived in the middle one of the seven cells of the
matrix will be a hermaphrodite.<a id="FNanchor_1066" href="#Footnote_1066" class="fnanchor">[1066]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Discussion
of divination.</div>

<p>Scot’s treatise on Physiognomy has considerable to say
of other forms of divination and they here appear in a
more favorable light than in his discussion of varieties of
the magic arts in the preface preceding his <i>Liber introductorius</i>.
Among signs to tell whether a pregnant woman
will give birth to a boy or a girl he suggests “a chiromantic
experiment”<a id="FNanchor_1067" href="#Footnote_1067" class="fnanchor">[1067]</a> which consists simply in asking her to hold
out her hand. If she extends the right, the child will be a
boy; if the left, a girl. He also expounds methods of augury
at some length, although again stating that they are in the
canons of the church, that is to say prohibited by canon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span>
law. The divisions of space employed in augury are twelve
in number after the fashion of the signs of the zodiac.<a id="FNanchor_1068" href="#Footnote_1068" class="fnanchor">[1068]</a>
Michael also discusses the significance of sneezes. If anyone
sneezes twice or four times while engaged in some
business and immediately rises and moves about, he will
prosper in his undertaking. If one sneezes twice in the
course of the night for three successive nights, it is a sign
of death or some catastrophe in the house. If after making
a contract one sneezes once, it is a sign that the agreement
will be kept inviolate; but if one sneezes thrice, the pact will
not be observed.<a id="FNanchor_1069" href="#Footnote_1069" class="fnanchor">[1069]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Divination
from
dreams.</div>

<p>Dreams and their interpretation are also discussed in
the <i>Physionomia</i>.<a id="FNanchor_1070" href="#Footnote_1070" class="fnanchor">[1070]</a> The age of the dreamer, the phase of
the moon, and the stage reached in the process of digestion,
all have their bearing upon interpretation. A dream which
occurs before the process of digestion has started either
has no significance or concerns the past. The dream which
comes while the food is being digested has to do with the
present. Only when the process of digestion has been completed
do dreams occur which signify concerning the future.
In order to recall a dream in the morning Michael recommends
sleeping upon one’s other side for the remainder of
the night or rubbing the back of the head the next day.
Some dreams signify gain, others loss; some joy, others
sadness; some sickness, others health, others war; some
labor, others rest. For instance, to catch a bird signifies
gain, to lose a bird in one’s dream signifies loss; to mourn
in dreams portends joy, to laugh indicates grief. The rest
of his discussion of dreams Scot limits to their significance
in matters of health and physical constitution. He takes up
dreams indicative of predominance of blood, red cholera,
phlegm, and melancholy respectively; of heat, cold, dryness,
and humidity; of excess of humors and of bad humors.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Works of
divination
ascribed
to Michael
Scot.</div>

<p>While on the subject of divination we may note that
a geomancy<a id="FNanchor_1071" href="#Footnote_1071" class="fnanchor">[1071]</a> and a chiromancy<a id="FNanchor_1072" href="#Footnote_1072" class="fnanchor">[1072]</a> have been ascribed to
Michael Scot, and also prophetic verses concerning the fate
of Italian cities in the style of the Sibylline verses and
prophecies of Merlin. Brown held that the evidence for
the authenticity of these verses was as convincing as that
for any event in Scot’s life.<a id="FNanchor_1073" href="#Footnote_1073" class="fnanchor">[1073]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Medical
writings.</div>

<p>It would not be surprising to find that Michael himself
practiced medicine as well as astrology, in view of the attention
given to human physiology and the process of generation
in his <i>Physiognomy</i> and elsewhere, and the interest in
biology which his translation of the Aristotelian works on
animals evidences. A treatise on prognostication from the
urine is ascribed to him<a id="FNanchor_1074" href="#Footnote_1074" class="fnanchor">[1074]</a> and “Pills of Master Michael
Scot” are mentioned in at least one manuscript,<a id="FNanchor_1075" href="#Footnote_1075" class="fnanchor">[1075]</a> where
they are declared to be good for all diseases and of virtue
indescribable.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Occult
virtues.</div>

<p>Michael’s general allusion to the occult virtue of words,
herbs, and stones in the <i>Liber introductorius</i> may be supplemented
by a few specific examples of the same from the
other two divisions of his main work. In the <i>Liber particularis</i>
he mentions such virtues of stones as the property
of the agate to reveal various signs of demons and illusions
of enchantment, and the power of the jasper to render its
bearer rich, amiable, and eloquent.<a id="FNanchor_1076" href="#Footnote_1076" class="fnanchor">[1076]</a> In the <i>Phisionomia</i>
he suggests that persons who cannot maintain physical
health without frequent sexual intercourse may be able to
do so by carrying a jasper or topaz.<a id="FNanchor_1077" href="#Footnote_1077" class="fnanchor">[1077]</a> He also states that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</span>
bathing in the blood of a dog or of two-year-old infants
mixed with hot water “undoubtedly cures leprosy,”<a id="FNanchor_1078" href="#Footnote_1078" class="fnanchor">[1078]</a> and
that many sorceries can be wrought by use of the menstrual
fluid, <i>semen</i>, hairs of the head, blood, and footprints in
dust or mud.<a id="FNanchor_1079" href="#Footnote_1079" class="fnanchor">[1079]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Astrology
in the
<i>Commentary
on the
Sphere</i>.</div>

<p>Michael Scot’s <i>Commentary upon the Sphere of Sacrobosco</i><a id="FNanchor_1080" href="#Footnote_1080" class="fnanchor">[1080]</a>
confines itself rather more strictly to astronomical
and astrological topics than did the <i>Liber introductorius</i>,
but otherwise their contents are not dissimilar. In the
Commentary Michael discusses such questions as whether
the universe is eternal, one or many, and what form or
figure it should have; whether the mover of the sky is
moved, whether the stars are spherical bodies, and whether
the zone between the tropic of Capricorn and the Antarctic
Circle is temperate and inhabited. Also whether the elements
are four in number, and whether the heavens include
a ninth sphere. One argument against its existence is that
there are no stars in it, on which account some hold that
it would exert no influence upon the earth. But Michael
replies that it has light apart from any starry bodies and
by virtue of this light does exert influence. Other astrological
questions which he raises are whether the signs of
the zodiac should be designated by the names of animals,
whether the first heaven is a more potent cause of generation
and corruption than the circle of the zodiac is, whether
celestial bodies have particular properties as terrestrial
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</span>
bodies do, whether the heavens are animate, whether their
motion is natural or voluntary, whether the motion of the
planets is rational, and whether supercelestial bodies act
upon inferiors by virtue of their motion. In mentioning the
departments of life over which the seven planets rule,
Michael cites either theologians or astrologers<a id="FNanchor_1081" href="#Footnote_1081" class="fnanchor">[1081]</a> to the effect
that Saturn signifies concerning pagans, Jews, and all other
adversaries of the Faith, who are slow to believe just as
Saturn is slow of movement and chilling in effect, while
Jupiter is the sign of true believers and Christians.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dionysius
the Areopagite
and
the solar
eclipse
during
Christ’s
passion.</div>

<p>In commenting upon Sacrobosco’s concluding passage
concerning the miraculous eclipse at the time of Christ’s
passion and the remark attributed to Dionysius the Areopagite,
“Either the God of nature suffers or the machine of
the universe is dissolved,” Michael explains that ancient
Athens was divided into three parts. One of these was the
shore which was consecrated to Neptune, but in place of
the plain and the mountains, Michael appears to take a
leaf out of Plato’s <i>Republic</i> and mentions the region of
the warriors, dedicated to Pallas, goddess of war, and the
residential quarter of the philosophers, named the Areopagus
from Ares meaning virtue and <i>pagus</i> meaning villa. According
to Michael the altar to the unknown god was erected
by Dionysius the Areopagite at the time of the darkness and
earthquake accompanying Christ’s passion, and when Paul
came and preached the Christ whom he ignorantly worshiped,
Dionysius was converted, and became a missionary
to the Gauls, bishop of Paris, and finally gained a martyr’s
crown.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Alchemy.</div>

<p>In the <i>Liber Introductorius</i> Michael seemed to associate
alchemy with the magic arts. In his <i>Commentary on the
Sphere</i> his attitude is more favorable. After citing the
fourth book of the <i>Meteorology</i> and other passages from
Aristotle to the effect that no element can be corrupted and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</span>
hence the transmutation striven after by the alchemists is
impossible, Michael explains that the word element may
be taken in two senses. As a part of the universe it is
neither generable nor corruptible, but in so far as an element
is mixed with active and passive qualities, it is both
generable and corruptible.<a id="FNanchor_1082" href="#Footnote_1082" class="fnanchor">[1082]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Works of
alchemy
ascribed
to Michael
Scot.</div>

<p>Thanks perhaps to this passage the composition or translation
of several works of alchemy is ascribed to Michael
Scot in manuscripts or printed editions. The <i>Quaestio
curiosa de natura Solis et Lunae</i>, which was printed as
Michael’s in two editions of the <i>Theatrum Chemicum</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1083" href="#Footnote_1083" class="fnanchor">[1083]</a> was
apparently written after his death.<a id="FNanchor_1084" href="#Footnote_1084" class="fnanchor">[1084]</a> A Palermo manuscript
contains among other alchemical tracts a “Book of Master
Michael Scot in which is contained the mastery.”<a id="FNanchor_1085" href="#Footnote_1085" class="fnanchor">[1085]</a> In at
least one manuscript Michael Scot is called the translator of
the <i>Liber luminis luminum</i>, of which Rasis is elsewhere
mentioned as the original author.<a id="FNanchor_1086" href="#Footnote_1086" class="fnanchor">[1086]</a> In an Oxford manuscript
a <i>De alchemia</i> is attributed to Michael Scot. It is
addressed to “you, great Theophilus, king of the Saracens”<a id="FNanchor_1087" href="#Footnote_1087" class="fnanchor">[1087]</a>
rather than to the Emperor Frederick, and speaks of “the
noble science” of alchemy as “almost entirely rejected among
the Latins.” Michael Scot mentions himself by name in
it rather too often for us to accept the treatise as his without
question, while the allusions to “Brother Elias” the
Franciscan as a fellow-worker in alchemy are perhaps also
open to suspicion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Brother
Elias and
alchemy.</div>

<p>We find, however, another suggestion of Brother Elias’s
interest in alchemy and association therein with Michael
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</span>
Scot in the fact that in the same manuscript containing
the translation of the <i>Liber luminis luminum</i> ascribed to
Michael occurs another <i>Liber lumen luminum</i> which Brother
Elias, General of the Friars Minor, edited in Latin for the
Emperor Frederick.<a id="FNanchor_1088" href="#Footnote_1088" class="fnanchor">[1088]</a> A brother Cyprian translated it from
Arabic into Latin for him. In view of the later interest
of another Franciscan friar, Roger Bacon, in alchemy and
the supposition which some have entertained that he was
persecuted by his Order because of his experimental studies,
this reputation of Brother Elias as an alchemist is interesting
to note. One of St. Francis’s earliest followers, he
succeeded him in 1226 as General of the Order. Deposed
by the pope in 1230 on the charge of promoting schism in
the Order, he was re-elected in 1236 and was again deposed
by the pope in 1239, after which he joined the imperial
party and was excommunicated from 1244 until just before
his death in 1253.<a id="FNanchor_1089" href="#Footnote_1089" class="fnanchor">[1089]</a> Brown suggested that his alchemical
activities were alluded to by the pope on the occasion of
his first deposition in the words “<i>mutari color optimus auri
ex quo caput erat compactum</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_1090" href="#Footnote_1090" class="fnanchor">[1090]</a> But if Elias was an
alchemist, no open objection to this appears to have been
made either by the pope or his Order. Indeed, many of
the alchemists in Italy of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries
were clergy and even friars.<a id="FNanchor_1091" href="#Footnote_1091" class="fnanchor">[1091]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Liber
luminis
luminum</i>
and <i>De
alchemia</i>.</div>

<p>Brown has already discussed the contents of the <i>Liber
luminis luminum</i> and <i>De alchemia</i> (or, <i>alchimia</i>)<a id="FNanchor_1092" href="#Footnote_1092" class="fnanchor">[1092]</a> but
erroneously and from not quite the same standpoint as ours.
He incorrectly interprets “the secrets of nature” which the
writer says he has investigated as the title of a book which
has formed his chief source.<a id="FNanchor_1093" href="#Footnote_1093" class="fnanchor">[1093]</a> Brown also states that one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</span>
of several features which distinguishes the <i>De alchemia</i> from
the <i>Liber luminis</i> “is an early passage which refers to the
correspondence between the metals and the planets.”<a id="FNanchor_1094" href="#Footnote_1094" class="fnanchor">[1094]</a> But
there is a similar passage connecting seven metals with the
seven planets in the opening paragraph of his own printed
text of the <i>Liber luminis luminum</i>.<a id="FNanchor_1095" href="#Footnote_1095" class="fnanchor">[1095]</a> The latter treatise,
brief as it is, divides into five parts dealing with salts, alums,
vitriols, spirits, and the preparation of alums, and the employment
of these in transmutation. The <i>De alchemia</i> is
less orderly in arrangement and seems largely a brief collection
of particular recipes for transmutation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Their
further
characteristics.</div>

<p>Both works emphasize the secret character of alchemy.
The <i>De alchemia</i> holds forth concerning the great secret of
Hermes and Ptolemy, and tells how most men’s eyes are
blinded, and to how few the truth of the art is revealed.
The <i>Liber luminis luminum</i> narrates that “when the great
philosopher was dying he said to his son, ‘O my son, hold
thy secret in thy heart, nor tell it to anyone, nor to thy son,
unless when thou canst retain it no longer.’ Wise philosophers
have yearned with yearning to know the truth of this
salt. But few have known it and those who have known
it have not told in their books the truth concerning it as
they saw it.”<a id="FNanchor_1096" href="#Footnote_1096" class="fnanchor">[1096]</a> Both works also are largely experimental
in form and in the <i>De alchemia</i> we are assured more than
once that “I, Michael Scot, have experienced this many
times.”<a id="FNanchor_1097" href="#Footnote_1097" class="fnanchor">[1097]</a> The books of the ancients and past philosophers
are cited both in general and by name, but a black vitriol
from France called French earth<a id="FNanchor_1098" href="#Footnote_1098" class="fnanchor">[1098]</a> and a gum found in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</span>
Calabria and at Montpellier<a id="FNanchor_1099" href="#Footnote_1099" class="fnanchor">[1099]</a> are mentioned as well as herbs
and minerals from India and Alexandria, and we also hear
of the experiments of brother Elias, certain Saracens who
seem of comparatively recent date, and of the operation at
Catania or Cortona by master Jacob the Jew which “I afterwards
proved many times.”<a id="FNanchor_1100" href="#Footnote_1100" class="fnanchor">[1100]</a> The <i>Liber luminis luminum</i>
often speaks of “the great virtue” of this or that, and both
treatises make much use of animal substances such as “dust
of moles,” the urine of the <i>taxo</i> or of a boy, the blood of a
ruddy man or of an owl or frog. Five toads are shut up in
a vessel and made to drink the juices of various herbs with
vinegar as the first step in the preparation of a marvelous
powder for purposes of transmutation.<a id="FNanchor_1101" href="#Footnote_1101" class="fnanchor">[1101]</a></p>

was a doctor of theology at
Paris.</p>

Philip see also Brown,
pp. 19, 36-7. The important passage
in the MS is, “Explicit

Brown, p. 19, translates the last
clause, “which experiment he
(i. e., Michael) contrived when
he lay sick in the city of Cordova,”
and so concludes that Scot
visited that city; but I should
translate it, “which he (Michael)
sent to him (Philip) while he
(Philip) lay sick in the city of
Cordova.” Otherwise why is
Philip mentioned at all?</p>

to two Paris MSS,
Anciens fonds 7399 and Fonds de
Sorbonne 1820, in one of which
the MS is dated 1217, while the
other gives the year as 1255 which
is the exactly corresponding year
of the Spanish era. Arsenal 1035,
14th century, fol. 112, a MS not
noted by Jourdain or Brown,
states the year as 1207 A. D., but
this is evidently a mistake for
1217, since it gives the same day
of the week and month as the
other MSS and August 18th fell
on Friday in 1217, but not in
1207. BN 16654, 13th century,
fol. 33, gives the date as 1217.</p>

mentions of Nimrod as an astronomer
in medieval authors, but
not the above passage from
Michael Scot. Although Latin
writers make Ioathon or Ionaton
(and various other spellings) the
disciple of Nimrod, in Syrian

of Noah and himself the discoverer

of Nimrod (Haskins, <i>op. cit.</i>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">The man
and his
writings.</div>

<p>We now come upon a Christian theologian whose works
present an unexpectedly detailed picture of the magic and
superstition of the time.<a id="FNanchor_1102" href="#Footnote_1102" class="fnanchor">[1102]</a> He is well acquainted with both
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</span>
the occult literature and the natural philosophy of the day,
and has much to say of magic, demons, occult virtue, divination
and astrology. Finally, he also gives considerable information
concerning what we may call the school of natural
magic and of experiment. This theologian is William of
Auvergne, bishop of Paris from 1228 to his death in 1249,
and previously a canon of that city and a master of theology
in its university. Judging from his age when he received
this degree Valois estimates that he was born about 1180.
He was made a bishop at Rome by the pope, where he had
come as a simple deacon to pursue his appeal in the recent
disputed election.<a id="FNanchor_1103" href="#Footnote_1103" class="fnanchor">[1103]</a> He granted the Dominicans their first
chair of theology at Paris during a quarrel of the university
in 1228 with Queen Blanche of Castile and the dispersion
of the faculties to Angers and Rheims.<a id="FNanchor_1104" href="#Footnote_1104" class="fnanchor">[1104]</a> He took a prominent
part in the Parisian attack upon the Talmud and was
perhaps the first Christian doctor of the Latin west to display
an intimate acquaintance with the works attributed to
Hermes Trismegistus.<a id="FNanchor_1105" href="#Footnote_1105" class="fnanchor">[1105]</a> These facts suggest the extent of
his reading in occult lore. We shall consider his views as
expressed in his various writings, “On Sins and Vices,”
“Of Laws” (or Religions), in the frequent medieval use of
the word, <i>lex</i>, “Of Morals,” “Of Faith,” but especially in
his voluminous work on “The Universe” which deals more
with the world of nature than do his other theological treatises.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</span>
Indeed, in the sixteenth century edition of his works
he is called “a most perfect mathematician” and “a distinguished
philosopher” as well as “a most eminent theologian.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">His respect
for
science.</div>

<p>William at any rate has respect for natural philosophy
and favors scientific investigation of nature. Like his namesake
of Conches in the preceding century he has no sympathy
with those who, when they are ignorant of the causes of
natural phenomena and have no idea how to investigate
them, have recourse to the Creator’s omnipotent virtue and
call everything of this sort a miracle, or evade the necessity
of any natural explanation by affirming that God’s will is
the sole cause of it. This seems to William an intolerable
error, in the first place because they have thus only one answer
for all questions, and secondly because they are satisfied
with the most remote cause instead of the most immediate
one. There is no excuse for thus neglecting so many
varied and noble sciences.<a id="FNanchor_1106" href="#Footnote_1106" class="fnanchor">[1106]</a></p>

<p>In another passage William apologizes to the person to
whom the <i>De universo</i> is addressed for the summary and
inadequate discussion of the stars in which he has just been
indulging.<a id="FNanchor_1107" href="#Footnote_1107" class="fnanchor">[1107]</a> He knows that certitude in this subject calls
for a most thorough investigation and requires a separate
treatise. Moreover, his remarks have been in the nature of
a digression and have little direct bearing on the question
under discussion. But he has introduced them in order that
his reader might see something of the depth and truth of
philosophical discussion and not think that it can be despised
as some fools do, who will accept nothing unless it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</span>
is armed with proofs and adorned with flowers of rhetoric
and who still more insanely regard as erroneous whatever
they do not understand.</p>

<div class="sidenote">And for
experimentation.</div>

<p>Thus we see the scientific standards of William of
Conches in the twelfth century still influential and probably
more universally prevalent in the thirteenth. Like his namesake
of Conches again, William of Auvergne states that our
common fire is not the pure element, since it is largely made
up of burning coal or wood or other consumed objects.<a id="FNanchor_1108" href="#Footnote_1108" class="fnanchor">[1108]</a> He
also states that “innumerable experiences” have proven that
moles do not live on earth but hunt worms in it.<a id="FNanchor_1109" href="#Footnote_1109" class="fnanchor">[1109]</a> William
is aware that many sailors and navigators have found by
experience that certain seas open into others, and as another
indication that all seas are really only one connected sea, he
adduces hidden subterranean channels, and mentions the report
that Sicily is supported on four or five mountains as if
by so many columns. Such are some illustrations of the
bits of scientific information and the trust in natural experiment
to be found in William’s work. It is indeed surprising
the number of times he alludes to “experimenters” and to
“books of experiments.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Influenced
by Christian
doctrine.</div>

<p>On the other hand William, of course, maintains such
doctrines as that of creation against the Peripatetic theory
of the eternity of the universe. He also does not confuse
the world soul with the Holy Spirit as William of Conches
and Theodoric of Chartres had done.<a id="FNanchor_1110" href="#Footnote_1110" class="fnanchor">[1110]</a> More important than
these particular points is the general hypothesis running
through and underlying much of William’s thought that the
Creator can interfere again in the course of nature at any
time and in any way He wills.<a id="FNanchor_1111" href="#Footnote_1111" class="fnanchor">[1111]</a> The atmosphere of the
miraculous and the spiritual is almost constantly felt in
William’s account of the universe. To a certain extent,
however, he evades the difficulties between science and religion
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</span>
by holding that one thing is true in philosophy and
quite another in theology. Thus he affirms that one who
says that the stars and lights of the sky do not receive addition
or improvement, speaks the truth if the matter is
regarded from the standpoint of natural science, for nature
cannot add anything to their natural perfection. “Yet you
ought to know that learned Christian doctors teach ... and
the prophets seem to say expressly that they will undergo
improvement.”<a id="FNanchor_1112" href="#Footnote_1112" class="fnanchor">[1112]</a> It is, then, as we said to begin with, the
account of magic, demons, occult virtue, divination, astrology
and experimental science, of a theologian not ignorant
of nor unsympathetic with science that we have now to consider.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Importance
of his
account
of magic.</div>

<p>William’s account of magic is a remarkable and illuminating
one. Most of it occurs in the closing chapters of
the <i>De universo</i>. William himself there states that nothing
has come down from previous writers on the things of
which he has just been speaking.<a id="FNanchor_1113" href="#Footnote_1113" class="fnanchor">[1113]</a> He admits that his remarks
are incomplete but he has at least made a beginning
which will prove welcome to the reader. Probably, however,
he is indebted to previous Christian writers; at any rate we
recognize some of his statements as familiar. But he also
has a wide acquaintance with the literature of magic itself&mdash;in
his youth he examined the books of judicial astronomy
and the books of the magicians and sorcerers<a id="FNanchor_1114" href="#Footnote_1114" class="fnanchor">[1114]</a>&mdash;and he combines
the results of his reading in a sane manner. We
feel that his view is both comprehensive, including all the
essential factors, and marked by insight into the heart of the
situation. For his time at least he sees remarkably clearly
what magic is, what it cannot do, and how it is related to
the science of that age.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its main
points
summarized.</div>

<p>The chief characteristics of magic as it is depicted by
William may first be briefly summarized, and then illustrated
in more detail. He constantly assumes that its great aim
is to work marvels. He holds that often the ends are sought
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</span>
by the help of demons and methods which are idolatrous.
Evil ends are often sought by magicians. On the other hand
the apparent marvels are often worked by mere human
sleight-of-hand or other tricks and deceptions of the magicians
themselves. But the marvel may be neither human deceit
nor the work of an evil spirit. It may be produced by
the wonderful occult virtues resident in certain objects of
nature. To marvels wrought in this manner William applies
the name “natural magic,” and has no doubt of its
truth. But he denies the validity of many methods and
devices in which magicians trust, and contends that marvels
cannot be so worked unless demons are responsible. William
furthermore constantly cites books of experiments and
narrates the feats of “experimenters” in discussing magic,
and he often implies a close connection of it with astronomy
or astrology. Here again as in the case of natural magic
we see an intimate connection between the development of
magic and of natural science. Finally, these various characteristics
and varieties of magic are not always kept distinct
by William, but often overlap or join. The demons
avail themselves of the forces of nature in working their
marvels and their marvels too are often only passing illusions
and empty shams. The experimenters and operators of
natural magic also deal in momentary effects and deceptive
appearances as well as in more solid results.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Demons
and magic.</div>

<p>William holds then that much of magic is performed by
the aid of demons and involves the worship of them or other
forms of idolatry.<a id="FNanchor_1115" href="#Footnote_1115" class="fnanchor">[1115]</a> One reason why magic feats are so seldom
performed in Christian lands and William’s own time
is that the power of the evil spirits has been so repressed by
Christianity. But the books of the magicians and of the
sorcerers assume the existence of armies of spirits in the
sky.<a id="FNanchor_1116" href="#Footnote_1116" class="fnanchor">[1116]</a> In the necromantic operation called “The Major Circle”
four kings of demons from the four quarters of the
earth appear with numerous attendants according to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</span>
statements of those who are skilled in works of this sort.<a id="FNanchor_1117" href="#Footnote_1117" class="fnanchor">[1117]</a>
William has also read in the books of experiments that water
can be made to appear where there really is none by use of a
bow of a particular kind of wood, an arrow of another kind
of wood, and a bow-string made of a particular sort of
cord.<a id="FNanchor_1118" href="#Footnote_1118" class="fnanchor">[1118]</a> As far as an arrow is shot from this bow so far one
is supposed to behold an expanse of water. But William
does not believe that the bow and arrow possess any such
virtues, and hence concludes that the mirage is an illusion
produced by the demons and that the ceremony performed
by the magician is a service to the evil spirits. Another
writer in his book of necromancy bids one to take as an oblation
such and such a wood or stone or liquor on such a day
at such an hour. Here too, perhaps because of what he regards
as superstitious observance of times and seasons, William
holds that the word “oblation” covers some diabolical
servitude or cult, which has been concealed by the writers of
such experiments. He also states that sorcerers and idolaters
often go off into deserts to have dealings with the demons
who dwell there.<a id="FNanchor_1119" href="#Footnote_1119" class="fnanchor">[1119]</a> He cites “a certain magician in his book
on magic arts” who says that in order to philosophize he
went to places destitute of any inhabitant and there lived for
thirty years with those who dwelt in light and learned from
them what he has written in his book.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Magic and
idolatry.</div>

<p>In his treatise <i>De legibus</i> William, like Maimonides,
endeavors to explain some of the questionable provisions
and prohibitions in the Mosaic law as measures to guard
against idolatry and magic.<a id="FNanchor_1120" href="#Footnote_1120" class="fnanchor">[1120]</a> Under the head of idolatry he
groups not only the worship of idols proper and of demons,
but also superstitious observance of the stars, the elements,
images, figures, words and names, times and seasons, beginnings
of actions and finding objects.<a id="FNanchor_1121" href="#Footnote_1121" class="fnanchor">[1121]</a> In another passage
he adds the observance of dreams, auguries, constellations,
sneezes, meetings, days and hours, figures, marks, characters
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</span>
and images.<a id="FNanchor_1122" href="#Footnote_1122" class="fnanchor">[1122]</a> Also incantation is not without idolatry.
Thus many features of the magic arts are condemned by
him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Magic
illusions.</div>

<p>We come next to those magic works which are “mockeries
of men or of demons.”<a id="FNanchor_1123" href="#Footnote_1123" class="fnanchor">[1123]</a> First there are those transpositions
which are accomplished by agility and hability of
the hands and are popularly called <i>tractationes</i> or <i>traiectationes</i>.
They are a source of great wonderment until men
learn how they are done. A second variety are mere apparitions
which have no truth. Under this head fall certain
magic candles. One made of wax and sulphurated snakeskin,
burned in a dark place filled with sticks or rushes makes
the house seem full of writhing serpents. William’s explanation
of this is that the powdered snakeskin as it burns
makes the rushes appear similar in color to serpents, while
the flickering of the flame gives the illusion that they are
moving. Possibly, however, this may be a defective recipe
for some firework like the modern “snake’s nest.” William
is more sceptical whether in the light of a candle made of
wax and the tears or <i>semen</i> of an ass men would look like
donkeys. He doubts whether wet tears would mix with
wax or burn if they did, and whether these internal fluids
possess any of the substance, figure, and color of an ass’s external
appearance. He concedes nevertheless that the <i>semen</i>
has great virtue and that the sight is of all senses the most
easily deceived. At any rate “experimenters” (<i>experimentatores</i>)
have said things of this sort, and you may read in
the books of experiments a trick by which anyone’s hand
is made to appear an ass’s foot, so that he blushes to draw
it from his bosom.<a id="FNanchor_1124" href="#Footnote_1124" class="fnanchor">[1124]</a></p>

<p>The work of necromancy called “The Major Circle” is
also in the nature of a delusive appearance. The four demon
kings from the four quarters of the earth seem to be accompanied
by vast hosts of phantom horsemen, jugglers, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</span>
musicians, but no prints of horses’ hoofs are visible afterwards.
Moreover, if real horsemen appeared, they would
be seen by everyone, not merely by those within the magic
circle. Another common apparition, produced by “these
sorcerers and deceivers” by means of sacrifices and other
evil observances which William will not reveal, is a wonderful
castle with gates, towers, walls, and citadel all complete.
But it is seen only during the magic operation and when it
vanishes leaves no trace behind. William compares such
illusions to some fantastic dream which leaves behind
nothing but horror on the faces of the participants. He argues
that if corporeal things outside us make the strong impression
on our senses that they do, it is no wonder if spiritual
substances like demons who are full of forms can impress
our minds potently. It will, of course, occur to the
modern reader that such illusions, like certain marvels
of India, were perhaps produced by hypnotic or other suggestion.
William notes that illusions of this sort are shown
only to the gullible and “those ignorant of natural science,”
and that necromancers dare not produce or suggest such
phantasms in the presence of learned and rational men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Natural
magic.</div>

<p>There are, nevertheless, occult forces and powers in
nature and those men who are acquainted with them work
many marvels and would work much more wonderful ones,
if they had an abundant supply of the necessary materials.<a id="FNanchor_1125" href="#Footnote_1125" class="fnanchor">[1125]</a>
This is “that part of natural science which is called natural
magic.”<a id="FNanchor_1126" href="#Footnote_1126" class="fnanchor">[1126]</a> “Philosophers call it necromancy or <i>philosophica</i>,
perhaps quite improperly, and it is the eleventh part of all
natural science.” This rather strange association of necromancy
with natural science for which William seems to apologize,
we shall meet again in Albertus Magnus and we have
already met with it in Gundissalinus, Daniel of Morley, and
Al-Farabi. With them, however, necromancy was one of
only eight parts of natural science or astrology. In a
third passage William omits mention of necromancy, but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</span>
again asserts that certain marvels are natural operations and
that knowledge of them is one of the eleven parts of natural
science.<a id="FNanchor_1127" href="#Footnote_1127" class="fnanchor">[1127]</a> It is with it that the books of experiments are especially
concerned.<a id="FNanchor_1128" href="#Footnote_1128" class="fnanchor">[1128]</a> From them and from “the books of
natural narrations” you can learn “the causes and reasons
of certain magic works, especially those which are by the
art of natural magic.” The materials possessed of the marvelous
virtues essential for this art are very rare in Europe,
but in India and lands near it they abound, and hence natural
magic flourishes vigorously there, and there are many experimenters
there who work marvels by their skill.<a id="FNanchor_1129" href="#Footnote_1129" class="fnanchor">[1129]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Natural
magic is
not concerned
with
demons.</div>

<p>Between this natural magic and that due to demons
William makes a decided distinction.<a id="FNanchor_1130" href="#Footnote_1130" class="fnanchor">[1130]</a> In natural magic
nothing is done by the aid of demons. The workers of the
one are called <i>magi</i> because they do great things (<i>magna
agentes</i>) although some may have evilly interpreted the word
as meaning evil-doers (<i>male agentes</i>).<a id="FNanchor_1131" href="#Footnote_1131" class="fnanchor">[1131]</a> And these others
who perform such works by the aid of demons are to be
regarded as evil-doers. William indeed perhaps uses the
word <i>malefici</i> (sorcerers) more often than <i>magi</i> for workers
of evil magic, but he cannot be said to observe any such distinction
uniformly. He does, however, express his intention
of setting forth “the causes and ways and methods” by
which even the phantasies and illusions of magic are produced
naturally, but of “perditious methods such as nefarious
sacrifices and oblations and sacrilegious observances” he
intends to reveal nothing.<a id="FNanchor_1132" href="#Footnote_1132" class="fnanchor">[1132]</a> In natural magic William seems
to see no harm whatever, unless it is employed for evil ends.
He grants, however, that some of its works are so marvelous
that they seem to the ignorant to be the works of gods or
demons, and that this has been one cause of idolatry in times
past.<a id="FNanchor_1133" href="#Footnote_1133" class="fnanchor">[1133]</a> So in order that Christianity might prevail, it was
ordered that anyone performing such works should be considered
evil and a sorcerer (<i>malus et maleficus</i>), and that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</span>
works of this sort should be regarded as performed not by
the virtue of any natural object but rather by the aid and
power of demons. But specialists in such matters are not
“surprised at these feats but glorify the Creator alone in
them, knowing that nature alone in accordance with His
omnipotent will operates both in the customary manner
known to men and contrary to custom not only in new ways
but new things.” In another context William again affirms
that natural magic involves no offense or injury to the
Creator unless one works evil or too curiously by that art.<a id="FNanchor_1134" href="#Footnote_1134" class="fnanchor">[1134]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Some instances
of
natural
magic.</div>

<p>One example of the marvels worked by means of natural
magic is the sudden generation of such animals as frogs and
worms. Here the natural processes of generation are
hastened by applying certain aids, and William does not
doubt the assertion of Emuth that by mixing seeds new
animals can be bred.<a id="FNanchor_1135" href="#Footnote_1135" class="fnanchor">[1135]</a> Other phenomena belonging under
natural magic are the marvels worked outside its own body
by the soul of the basilisk and certain other animals and
certain human souls&mdash;a hint that the power of fascination is
natural magic.<a id="FNanchor_1136" href="#Footnote_1136" class="fnanchor">[1136]</a> In short, all use of occult virtue in nature
may be classed as natural magic.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“The sense
of nature.”</div>

<p>Of William’s statements concerning occult virtue we
shall hear more under that head. But we may note here what
he says of “the sense of nature,”<a id="FNanchor_1137" href="#Footnote_1137" class="fnanchor">[1137]</a> which he calls “one of
the roots of natural magic,” which he often mentions, and
which in his opinion accounts for a number of wonderful
things.<a id="FNanchor_1138" href="#Footnote_1138" class="fnanchor">[1138]</a> It is “a sublimer sense than any human apprehension
and nobler and more akin to prophecy.” By it one
senses the presence in the house of a burglar or harlot who
is otherwise unperceived by any of the ordinary senses. By
it some dogs can detect a thief in a crowd.<a id="FNanchor_1139" href="#Footnote_1139" class="fnanchor">[1139]</a> It is the mysterious
power by which vultures foresee the coming battle,
sheep detect the approach of the wolf, and the spider that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</span>
of the fly. William tells of a woman who could feel the
presence of the man she loved when he was two miles distant<a id="FNanchor_1140" href="#Footnote_1140" class="fnanchor">[1140]</a>
and of another woman who so abhorred her husband
that she fell into an epileptic fit whenever he entered the
house.<a id="FNanchor_1141" href="#Footnote_1141" class="fnanchor">[1141]</a> In the main, this sense of nature seems about the
same as what other writers call the power of natural divination.
William, however, in several cases accounts for it by
the strong sympathy or antipathy existing between the two
persons or animals concerned.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Magic’s
too extreme
pretensions.</div>

<p>While William accepts such marvels and strange forces,
there are many claims of magic which he refuses to grant.<a id="FNanchor_1142" href="#Footnote_1142" class="fnanchor">[1142]</a>
As we shall see later he sets limits even to the powers of
demons. Much less will he allow the extreme powers asserted
of human magicians. In the books of the magicians
appear subversions of nature of every sort. They would
bind fire so that it cannot burn, robbers that they may not
steal in a certain region, a well or spring so that no water
may be drawn from it, and so with merchants and ships.
They would even stop water from flowing down hill. William
contends that such works are possible only by divine
miracle, and that if the Chaldeans, Egyptians, and Arabs
could really accomplish the lies in their books, they would
have conquered the world long ago. Nay, the world would
be at the mercy of any single magician or sorcerer (<i>magi seu
malefici</i>). William then raises the objection that if two
magicians tried to gain the same object at once, the magic
of one or the other would prove a failure or they would
both share an imperfect and half-way success, and in either
case the promises of their art would prove a failure. The
same logic might be applied to the advice how to succeed
given to young men by some of our “self-made” millionaires
(are they <i>magi</i> or <i>malefici</i>?) who have exploited natural resources.
William, however, goes on to explain that the
books of magic say that not all artificers are equally skilful
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</span>
or born under a lucky star. He points out the limitations
of Pharaoh’s magicians in much the usual manner.<a id="FNanchor_1143" href="#Footnote_1143" class="fnanchor">[1143]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Wax
images.</div>

<p>William not only denies that magic can attain some extreme
results, but also denies that some of the methods employed
in magic are suited or adequate to the ends aimed
at. He especially attacks the employment of images and
characters, words, names, and incantations. The use of wax
images in magic to harm the person or thing of whom the
image is made seems to him a futile proceeding. He will not
believe that Nectanebo&mdash;the magician of the Pseudo-Callisthenes,
it will be remembered&mdash;could sink the ships of the
enemy by submerging wax images of them.<a id="FNanchor_1144" href="#Footnote_1144" class="fnanchor">[1144]</a> Such magic
images possess neither intelligence nor will, nor can they
act by bodily virtue, since that requires contact either direct
or indirect to be effective.<a id="FNanchor_1145" href="#Footnote_1145" class="fnanchor">[1145]</a> If someone suggests that they
act by sense of nature, he should know that inanimate objects
are incapable of this.<a id="FNanchor_1146" href="#Footnote_1146" class="fnanchor">[1146]</a> The only way in which the occasional
seemingly successful employment of such images
can be accounted for is that when the magician does anything
to the image, demons inflict the same sufferings upon
the person against whom the image is used, and thus deceive
men into thinking that the virtue of the image accomplishes
this result.<a id="FNanchor_1147" href="#Footnote_1147" class="fnanchor">[1147]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Factitious
gods.</div>

<p>Hermes Trismegistus speaks to Asclepius in the <i>Liber de
hellera</i> or <i>De deo deorum</i> of terrestrial gods, associated each
with some material substance, such as stones and aromatics
which have the natural force of divinity in them.<a id="FNanchor_1148" href="#Footnote_1148" class="fnanchor">[1148]</a> Hermes,
however, distinguished from natural gods “factitious gods,”
or statues, idols, and images made by man, into which “the
splendor of deity and virtue of divinity” is poured or impressed
by celestial spirits or the heavens and stars, “and
this with observation of the hours and constellations when
the image is cast or engraved or fabricated.” William regrets
to say that traces of this error still prevail “among
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</span>
many old women, and Christians at that.” And they say
that sixty years after their manufacture these images lose
their virtue. William does not believe that there is divinity
in stones or herbs or aromatics, or that men can make gods
of any sort.<a id="FNanchor_1149" href="#Footnote_1149" class="fnanchor">[1149]</a> Minds and souls cannot be put into statues,<a id="FNanchor_1150" href="#Footnote_1150" class="fnanchor">[1150]</a>
and William concludes that Trismegistus “erred shamefully”
and “was marvelously deceived by the evil spirits themselves.”<a id="FNanchor_1151" href="#Footnote_1151" class="fnanchor">[1151]</a>
He also calls impossible “what is so celebrated
among the astrologers (<i>astronomos</i>), and written in so many
of the books, namely, that a statue will speak like a man
if one casts it of bronze in the rising of Saturn.”<a id="FNanchor_1152" href="#Footnote_1152" class="fnanchor">[1152]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Characters
and
figures.</div>

<p>William likewise holds that characters or figures or impressions
or astrological images have no force unless they
are tokens by which the evil spirits may recognize their worshipers.<a id="FNanchor_1153" href="#Footnote_1153" class="fnanchor">[1153]</a>
There is no divinity in the angles of Solomon’s
pentagon. William states that some are led into this error
from their theories concerning the stars, and that the idolatrous
cult of the stars distinguishes four kinds of figures:
seals, rings, characters, and images.<a id="FNanchor_1154" href="#Footnote_1154" class="fnanchor">[1154]</a> Such are the rings and
seal of Solomon with their “execrable consecrations and detestable
invocations.” Even more unspeakable is that image
called <i>idea Salomonis et entocta</i>, and the figure known as
<i>mandel</i> or <i>amandel</i>. So excessive are the virtues attributed
to such images that they belong only to God, so that it is
evident that God has been shorn of His glory which has
been transferred to such figures. Artesius in his book on the
virtue of words and characters asserts that by a certain magic
figure he bound a mill so that the wheels could not turn.<a id="FNanchor_1155" href="#Footnote_1155" class="fnanchor">[1155]</a>
But William is incredulous as to such powers in characters.
He thinks that one might as well say that virtue of the figure
would run the mill without water or mill-wheels. If the mill
did stop, it must have been the work of demons. Nor can
William see any sense in writing the day and hour when
thunder was heard in that locality on the walls of houses in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</span>
order to protect them from lightning.<a id="FNanchor_1156" href="#Footnote_1156" class="fnanchor">[1156]</a> It seems to him an
attribution of the strongest force to the weakest sort of an
incidental occurrence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Power
of words
denied.</div>

<p>William indeed denies that there is magic power in mere
words or incantations. Mere words cannot kill men or animals
as sorcerers claim.<a id="FNanchor_1157" href="#Footnote_1157" class="fnanchor">[1157]</a> William argues scholastically that
if spoken words possessed any such virtue they must derive
it either from the material of which they are composed, air,
or from their form, sound; or from what they signify. Air
cannot kill unless it is poisoned by a plague, dragon, or toad.
Sound to kill must be deafening. If what is signified by the
word is the cause, then images, which are more exact likenesses,
would be more powerful than words. William’s
opinion is that when sorcerers employ magic words and incantations
they are simply calling upon the demons for aid,
just as the worshipers of God sometimes induce Him to
work wonders by calling upon His name.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Use of
divine
names.</div>

<p>This brings William to the delicate question of divine
names. He censures the use of the name of God by “magicians
and astronomers” in “working their diabolical marvels.”<a id="FNanchor_1158" href="#Footnote_1158" class="fnanchor">[1158]</a>
He also notes that they employ a barbaric name
and not one of the four Hebrew names of God. They forbid
anyone who is not pure and clad in pure vestments to
presume to touch the book in which this name is written,
but they try to gain evil ends by it and so blaspheme against
their Creator. William, however, seems to feel that the
names of God have a virtue not found in ordinary words
and he states that not only servants of God but even wicked
men sometimes cast out demons by making use of holy
exorcisms.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Christian
magic.</div>

<p>In short, incantations possess no efficacy, but exorcisms
do. This is an indication, not merely of William’s logical
inconsistency, but also of the existence of a Christian or ecclesiastical
variety of magic in his day. He will not believe
in Nectanebo’s wax images, but he believes that the forms
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</span>
of wax which have the likeness of lambs receive through
the benediction of the pope the virtue of warding off thunderbolts.<a id="FNanchor_1159" href="#Footnote_1159" class="fnanchor">[1159]</a>
He denied that magic words had efficacy through
their sound but he affirms that consecrated bells prevent
storms within the sound of their ringing, and that salt and
water which have been blessed obtain the power of expelling
demons. William, however, takes refuge in God’s omnipotent
virtue to explain the efficacy of these Christian charms.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Magic of
sex and
generation.</div>

<p>Magic appears to have always devoted considerable attention
to matters of sex and generation, and William’s
works give one or two instances of this. He states that sorcerers
investigate the cohabiting of certain animals, thinking
that if they kill them at that hour they will obtain from their
carcasses potent love-charms and aids to fecundity.<a id="FNanchor_1160" href="#Footnote_1160" class="fnanchor">[1160]</a> We
are also told that men have tried to produce, and thought
that they succeeded in producing human life in other ways
than by the usual generative process.<a id="FNanchor_1161" href="#Footnote_1161" class="fnanchor">[1161]</a> “And in the books of
experiments may be found mockeries of women similar to
those which the demons called <i>incubi</i> work and which certain
sorcerers have attempted and left in writing for posterity.”
They have recorded a delusive experiment by which
women who have been known only once or twice think that
this has occurred fifty or sixty times.</p>

<div class="sidenote">William’s
contribution
to the
bibliography
of
magic.</div>

<p>As has been already incidentally suggested, William offers
considerable information as to the bibliography of magic
in his day. Besides his many general allusions to works of
magic, writings of sorcerers and prestidigitateurs and astrologers
and books of experiments, he mentions several
particular works ascribed to Aristotle and Avicenbros, to
Hermes Trismegistus and Solomon, the “cursed book” of
Cocogrecus on “Stations to the cult of Venus” and, what is
perhaps the same, of Thot grecus on “The cult of Venus.”<a id="FNanchor_1162" href="#Footnote_1162" class="fnanchor">[1162]</a>
An Artesius or Arthesius, whom in one passage he calls a
magician and cites concerning divination by water and whom
in another passage he calls both a magician and a philosopher
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</span>
who had written a book on the virtue of words and
characters,<a id="FNanchor_1163" href="#Footnote_1163" class="fnanchor">[1163]</a> is probably the same Artesius who is cited concerning
divination by the rays of the sun or moon in liquids
or mirrors in a work of alchemy in a twelfth century manuscript,<a id="FNanchor_1164" href="#Footnote_1164" class="fnanchor">[1164]</a>
and further identical with the Artephius who
Roger Bacon says lived for one thousand and twenty-five
years,<a id="FNanchor_1165" href="#Footnote_1165" class="fnanchor">[1165]</a> to whom a treatise is ascribed in the <i>Theatrum
Chymicum</i><a id="FNanchor_1166" href="#Footnote_1166" class="fnanchor">[1166]</a> and a Sloane manuscript,<a id="FNanchor_1167" href="#Footnote_1167" class="fnanchor">[1167]</a> and who seems to
have been the same as Altughra’i, a poet and alchemist who
died in 1128.<a id="FNanchor_1168" href="#Footnote_1168" class="fnanchor">[1168]</a> There also are a number of magic books of
which William does not give the author’s name or the title,
but of which he gives descriptions or from which he makes
citations which would be sufficiently definite to identify the
works should one meet with them elsewhere. In our chapters
on pseudo-literature and experimental literature we treat
of many of these works.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Plan of
the rest
of this
chapter.</div>

<p>From our survey of magic proper as delineated in William’s
works we now turn to what he represents as the two
chief forces in magic, namely, the demons and the occult
virtues in nature, and to two subjects which he closely connects
with magic, namely, divination and astrology. These
four topics will be taken up separately in the order stated.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
theory of
spiritual
substances.</div>

<p>Since William attributes so much of magic to demons, it
is important to note what he has to say concerning these
“spiritual substances.” He proposes to follow as his sources
on the subject “authentic accounts” (<i>sermones authentici</i>):
first of all the statements of the divinely inspired prophets,
and after that the opinions of the philosophers and also of
the magicians. He observes elsewhere, however, that there
is a lack of literature on the subject; the sages have only
dipped into it and not yet plumbed it to its depths: in fact,
only the treatise of Avicenbros has come to his hands, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</span>
while that authority has said and written many sublime
things, far removed from popular comprehension, still he
has made only a beginning in this field.<a id="FNanchor_1169" href="#Footnote_1169" class="fnanchor">[1169]</a> William also utilizes,
however, the works of Hermes Trismegistus<a id="FNanchor_1170" href="#Footnote_1170" class="fnanchor">[1170]</a> and
other books of necromancy and magic&mdash;among them Thot
Graecus<a id="FNanchor_1171" href="#Footnote_1171" class="fnanchor">[1171]</a>&mdash;the testimony of medical men<a id="FNanchor_1172" href="#Footnote_1172" class="fnanchor">[1172]</a> and “innumerable
experiences” of men at large.<a id="FNanchor_1173" href="#Footnote_1173" class="fnanchor">[1173]</a></p>

<p>William professes himself open to conviction and new
light on the question of the assumption of bodies by good
and bad spirits.<a id="FNanchor_1174" href="#Footnote_1174" class="fnanchor">[1174]</a> And it must be said that his whole treatment
of spirits is full of inconsistencies and difficulties. Part
of the time he draws a hard and fast line between spiritual
substances and physical creation, but only part of the time.
He also essays the difficult task of explaining how and to
what extent these spiritual substances are able to disturb
physical creation, and how far they in turn are affected by it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Spirits
in the
heavens.</div>

<p>To begin with, William takes up the difficult position&mdash;or
rather he makes it difficult for himself&mdash;but the usual one
with medieval theologians, that angels occupy physical space
and are located in their own heaven as the stars are in theirs.<a id="FNanchor_1175" href="#Footnote_1175" class="fnanchor">[1175]</a>
Some modern believers in spiritualism hold a very similar
position.<a id="FNanchor_1176" href="#Footnote_1176" class="fnanchor">[1176]</a> He also declares that the tenth and last or empyrean
heaven will be the eternal abode of men whose souls are
saved, although the resurrected bodies of the saved would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</span>
presumably still be corporal substances.<a id="FNanchor_1177" href="#Footnote_1177" class="fnanchor">[1177]</a> This raises the further
difficulty that apparently the empyrean heaven cannot
be the abode of the angels, as some theologians and saintly
doctors have held (for a corporal place cannot be filled except
with corporal substances), for those superficial persons who
mock the authentic divine revelation of scripture will say
that “if that heaven is a corporal place it cannot be filled except
by corporal substances.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Will hell
be big
enough?</div>

<p>Another point which puzzles William is whether there
will be room in hell for all the evil spirits and resurrected
bodies of the damned destined to make it their ultimate
abode. The infernal regions, located in the interior of our
terrestrial globe, seem very small to him compared with the
vast expanse of the empyrean heaven which is even greater
than that of the fixed stars. And our earth is a mere dot
compared to the sphere of the fixed stars. If then that entire
empyrean heaven is to be filled with glorified men, how
shall the infernal regions hold all the damned?<a id="FNanchor_1178" href="#Footnote_1178" class="fnanchor">[1178]</a> It will be
seen that Dante’s later cosmology is very similar to William’s.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Astrological
necromancy.</div>

<p>William will not agree, however,<a id="FNanchor_1179" href="#Footnote_1179" class="fnanchor">[1179]</a> with the books of
magic and the masters of images and illusions that the starry
heavens and even single planets are inhabited by spirits so
that the circle of the moon has fifty ministering spirits and
that there are also angels in the twelve signs of the zodiac.
On the other hand, in an earlier chapter he makes the statement
that he has never heard anywhere even in magic books
of demons with power over celestial bodies.<a id="FNanchor_1180" href="#Footnote_1180" class="fnanchor">[1180]</a> William is of
the opinion that Aristotle was deceived by an evil spirit into
boasting that a spirit had descended to him from the circle
of Venus.<a id="FNanchor_1181" href="#Footnote_1181" class="fnanchor">[1181]</a> William argues that the starry heavens are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</span>
<i>rational</i> and able to regulate themselves and do not require
any ministering angels; and on the other hand that the nobler
spirits would not debase themselves by ministering to
mere celestial <i>bodies</i>.<a id="FNanchor_1182" href="#Footnote_1182" class="fnanchor">[1182]</a> William’s own theory is that demons
dwell in the air about the earth and not in the planetary
heavens. He also speaks in one passage of their especially
frequenting deserts.<a id="FNanchor_1183" href="#Footnote_1183" class="fnanchor">[1183]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">False accounts
of
fallen
angels.</div>

<p>William also rejects<a id="FNanchor_1184" href="#Footnote_1184" class="fnanchor">[1184]</a> some non-Christian assertions concerning
fallen angels. One is the statement of the author of
a book of sorcery, who claimed to have communed with
spirits thirty years, to the effect that new spirits are created
daily, and that there are twelve orders of them, and that every
day a multitude of them fall and that they fall into different
regions of the earth and there rule&mdash;some in deserts, some
in woods, some in fountains and rivers, some in herbs and
trees, some in gems and stones, which thus derive their marvel-working
qualities from them. The other account rejected
by William is a pretty story from Hermes to this effect.<a id="FNanchor_1185" href="#Footnote_1185" class="fnanchor">[1185]</a>
When two angels were criticizing mankind harshly
for its sinfulness God incarnated them to see how much better
they would do. Both promptly fell in love with a beautiful
woman who would return their love only on condition
that they renounce God. When they had done even this,
God called them to heaven, reproved them for not having
justified their criticism of sinful mankind, and told them to
choose now their place of punishment. They selected the air,
but later through the prayers of a prophet in Babylon were
shut up in a cave to await their final punishment at the last
judgment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Different
kinds of
spirits.</div>

<p>William of course makes the usual sharp Christian distinction
between good spirits or angels and bad spirits or
demons. It is the latter alone, rather than spiritual substances
in general, whom he connects with magic, although
naturally the magicians themselves often claim to employ
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</span>
good spirits. William is in doubt whether fauns and pygmies
and some other monsters are demons or animals or
men.<a id="FNanchor_1186" href="#Footnote_1186" class="fnanchor">[1186]</a> He also lists satyrs, <i>joculatores</i>, incubi, succubi,
nymphs, Lares, Penates and other old Latin names such as
<i>cloacina</i>, <i>Lucina</i>, <i>limitanus</i>, <i>priapus</i>, <i>genius</i>, <i>hymenus</i>.<a id="FNanchor_1187" href="#Footnote_1187" class="fnanchor">[1187]</a> He
regards as a delusion the belief fostered by old-wives in
demons who injure infants.<a id="FNanchor_1188" href="#Footnote_1188" class="fnanchor">[1188]</a> Despite his mention of incubi
and succubi and despite the verses of Scripture about the sons
of God and the daughters of men and that woman ought to
veil her head on account of the angels, he regards demons
as incapable of sexual intercourse with human beings, but
he thinks it possible that they may juggle with nature so as
to produce the effects of sexual intercourse.<a id="FNanchor_1189" href="#Footnote_1189" class="fnanchor">[1189]</a> He mentions
the belief in a demon who comes to cellars at night in
women’s clothing and bestows abundance and prosperity
where food and drink is left uncovered for it to partake
of, which it does without diminishing the quantity. “And
they call her <i>satia</i> from satiety.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Limited
demon
control of
nature.</div>

<p>What is the extent of the control over matter exercised
by the demons in performing marvels? In discussing what
demons can and cannot perform in the ways of marvels,
William’s decisions seem rather arbitrary and capricious.<a id="FNanchor_1190" href="#Footnote_1190" class="fnanchor">[1190]</a>
He grants them superhuman powers of divination and says
that it has been repeatedly proved that they know when invocations
and sacrifices are made to them.<a id="FNanchor_1191" href="#Footnote_1191" class="fnanchor">[1191]</a> But the apparitions
which they produce are neither real objects nor images
in the air but thoughts and pictures in the mind of the beholder.<a id="FNanchor_1192" href="#Footnote_1192" class="fnanchor">[1192]</a>
The armies of horsemen produced by necromancers
leave no prints of hoofs behind them and their elaborate castles
with gates, towers, walls, and citadel completely vanish
without leaving a trace.<a id="FNanchor_1193" href="#Footnote_1193" class="fnanchor">[1193]</a> This explains how enchanters and
magicians can apparently cut horses in two, although William
grants it not unlikely that there may be other ways of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</span>
doing this for those “who know the marvellous occult virtues
of many things.” William also discusses how demons
can toss sticks and stones about, throw persons out of bed,
and transport men or huge rocks for great distances when
they have neither necks nor shoulders to carry them on.<a id="FNanchor_1194" href="#Footnote_1194" class="fnanchor">[1194]</a>
This is no more strange, he says, than the magnet’s ability
to draw iron.<a id="FNanchor_1195" href="#Footnote_1195" class="fnanchor">[1195]</a> He believes that the virtue of spiritual substances
can overcome weight which holds bodies at rest and
produce lightness which makes motion easy. It was thus
that an angel transported one of the Hebrew prophets to
Babylon by a lock of his hair. It is doubtful, however, if
this last could have been accomplished save by divine aid.
He doubts furthermore if horses could be generated as the
frogs were by the Egyptian magicians of Pharaoh. The
generation of frogs is a much easier and more rapid process.
Also the wax lights which mysteriously appear in stables on
the horses’ manes and tails would be easy for demons to
make.<a id="FNanchor_1196" href="#Footnote_1196" class="fnanchor">[1196]</a> But William disbelieves in such magic transformations
as werwolves. His explanation is that the devil first
made the man imagine himself a wolf and then caused a real
wolf to appear and frighten people.<a id="FNanchor_1197" href="#Footnote_1197" class="fnanchor">[1197]</a> Demons cannot make
idols or images speak, but when the bodies of human beings
are possessed by demons, they form voices after a fashion,
although, as exorcists have assured him, in a raucous tone
unlike the usual human voice, probably because the vocal
chords respond but indifferently to demoniacal abuse of
them.<a id="FNanchor_1198" href="#Footnote_1198" class="fnanchor">[1198]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Can
demons
be imprisoned
or enter
bodies?</div>

<p>William is sure that demons cannot be imprisoned against
their will in material bodies, whether rings, gems, mirrors,
or glass phials such as Solomon is said to have shut them
up in.<a id="FNanchor_1199" href="#Footnote_1199" class="fnanchor">[1199]</a> William argues that if a man died in a huge corked
bottle his soul would be able to get out. William, however,
believes his Bible when it tells him of demons shut up in
men whom “they vex with innumerable tortures,” or in swine
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</span>
or in lakes,<a id="FNanchor_1200" href="#Footnote_1200" class="fnanchor">[1200]</a> although he declares that he does not adduce
the case of demons in swine because it is recorded in the
Bible but because it is attested by the experience of many.
And he declares that even to his day demons give most certain
indication of their presence in lakes when stones are
thrown in or they are provoked by some other movement or
sound.<a id="FNanchor_1201" href="#Footnote_1201" class="fnanchor">[1201]</a> He states, however, that many medical men deny
that human beings are possessed by demons and attribute
the seizures and agitations to fumes and vapors.<a id="FNanchor_1202" href="#Footnote_1202" class="fnanchor">[1202]</a> Many
skilled doctors also dispute the existence of the nocturnal
demon called <i>ephialtes</i> and attribute the oppressive feeling
to action of the heart and not to the weight of a demon.
In this instance William is inclined to agree with the physicians.<a id="FNanchor_1203" href="#Footnote_1203" class="fnanchor">[1203]</a>
William holds that it is useless to strike at demons
when they appear before you, for you merely beat the air,
as many experiments have shown.<a id="FNanchor_1204" href="#Footnote_1204" class="fnanchor">[1204]</a> But he believes that
demons can be punished not only by material hell fire but
by contact with the other three elements, air, earth and water.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Susceptibility
of
demons to
the four
elements
and to
natural
objects.</div>

<p>Demons feel any affront offered or indignity done them
very keenly so that saints have often routed them by a volley
of spit. William is also inclined to accept the “ancient opinion
among the Romans” that human urine dissolves works
of magic.<a id="FNanchor_1205" href="#Footnote_1205" class="fnanchor">[1205]</a> Furthermore there are several natural objects
which have the occult virtue of driving away demons, a
peony suspended from the neck&mdash;Galen’s old remedy for the
epileptic boy&mdash;or the top of the heart of a certain fish placed
on the coals. If it is asked how it is that these proud spiritual
substances are thus subject to the virtues of physical bodies,
William can only answer that it is probably in consequence
of their fall, which also subjected them to hell fire. William’s
logic simply reduces to this, that God can do anything
He pleases with demons while men can do nothing with them
against the demons’ wills and without imperiling their own
souls.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Stock examples
of
natural
marvels.</div>

<p>William is as credulous concerning the marvelous powers
attributed to herbs, gems and animals, and as anxious to
find some plausible explanation of their validity, as he was
sceptical in regard to images, characters and words. We
encounter once more in his pages many of the stock examples
of natural marvels which we have met again and again in
previous writers and shall find in many writers after him.
He rhapsodizes concerning the power of the magnet and
mentions its three species according to Hermes (Mercurius).<a id="FNanchor_1206" href="#Footnote_1206" class="fnanchor">[1206]</a>
He tells of the phoenix, of the masculine and feminine
palms, and of theriac.<a id="FNanchor_1207" href="#Footnote_1207" class="fnanchor">[1207]</a> Indeed, the magnet, the palms,
and the story of the hazel rod told below are all introduced
while William is supposedly discussing divine providence.
In more than one passage he tells&mdash;perhaps directly from
Pliny&mdash;of the stupefaction produced by the <i>torpedo</i> in persons
who touch it only with a long stick, of the little <i>echinus</i>
or <i>remora</i> which stops great ships, or of the powers of lion
and basilisk, and of the gem heliotrope which aided by the
virtue of the herb of the same name renders one invisible.<a id="FNanchor_1208" href="#Footnote_1208" class="fnanchor">[1208]</a>
For this assertion concerning heliotrope, however, which
Pliny stigmatized as an example of the magicians’ impudence,<a id="FNanchor_1209" href="#Footnote_1209" class="fnanchor">[1209]</a>
William cites the writings of experimenters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The hazel
rod story.</div>

<p>On the other hand, a passage in William’s work concerning
the property of a hazel rod was repeated within a
few years by at least three writers: Albertus Magnus, John
of St. Amand, and Roger Bacon. William relates that men
say that if the rod is split in two lengthwise the halves will
approach one another again of their own accord and reunite.<a id="FNanchor_1210" href="#Footnote_1210" class="fnanchor">[1210]</a>
Deceivers attribute this to the virtue of certain
words which they utter, but it is by virtue and sense of
nature.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Occult
virtues of
herbs and
animals.</div>

<p>William regards the occult virtue of things on this earth
as so certain that he uses it to argue that the stars too must
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</span>
possess great powers.<a id="FNanchor_1211" href="#Footnote_1211" class="fnanchor">[1211]</a> This is attested “from the operations
of the virtues of other things, both animals and parts
of them, also herbs, medicines, and stones.”<a id="FNanchor_1212" href="#Footnote_1212" class="fnanchor">[1212]</a> Of medicines
he especially recommends the <i>empirica</i> to the reader’s consideration.<a id="FNanchor_1213" href="#Footnote_1213" class="fnanchor">[1213]</a>
The virtues of herbs have been proved to be
very numerous and very marvelous.<a id="FNanchor_1214" href="#Footnote_1214" class="fnanchor">[1214]</a> As for animals, after
describing the virtues of the basilisk, William adds, “and
when you have heard similar and maybe greater things concerning
the occult virtues of other animals, you will not marvel
at these.” Among many medicines which prolong life
he believes that the flesh of snakes has great renovating virtue,<a id="FNanchor_1215" href="#Footnote_1215" class="fnanchor">[1215]</a>
and among medicines supposed to produce visions and
revelations he names the eye of an Indian tortoise and the
heart of the hoopoe,<a id="FNanchor_1216" href="#Footnote_1216" class="fnanchor">[1216]</a> which are thought to clear the soul of
noxious vapors in sleep and pave the way for illuminations.
William suggests that these substances may horrify one so
as to shock the soul free from the body. He even mentions
a medicine the smoke from which in the room in which one
is sleeping will free the soul from the body so that it emerges
into the region of light and the luminosity of the Creator.<a id="FNanchor_1217" href="#Footnote_1217" class="fnanchor">[1217]</a>
And in the case of the little fish which binds ships so that
they cannot move, he holds it indubitable that this cannot
possibly be done by any bodily virtue which it possesses and
must be by some spiritual virtue which exists in its soul.<a id="FNanchor_1218" href="#Footnote_1218" class="fnanchor">[1218]</a>
This reminds him of the power of the human imagination
as shown in the case of the man who cast down a camel by
merely imagining its fall.<a id="FNanchor_1219" href="#Footnote_1219" class="fnanchor">[1219]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</span></p><div class="sidenote">Virtues
of gems.</div>

<p>To the virtues of gems William alludes a number of
times. He recounts how the sapphire of its own motion
springs into a diseased human eye and cleanses it of its noxious
humors.<a id="FNanchor_1220" href="#Footnote_1220" class="fnanchor">[1220]</a> He also finds it asserted that the emerald
attracts riches to its owner and that the topaz checks the passions
of avarice, cupidity, luxury, and evil desire. He endeavors
to explain how it may be possible for the stone
heliotrope to render one invisible; as the power of the stone
turns the brightness of the sunlight to a ruby shade, so it
may be that the potency of its color prevents the spectators
from discerning at all the color of the man who wears it,
just as it is said that a musical instrument strung with snake-skin
drowns the sound of all other instruments.<a id="FNanchor_1221" href="#Footnote_1221" class="fnanchor">[1221]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">A medley
of marvelous
virtues.</div>

<p>Some of the virtues ascribed to natural objects William
finds almost too marvelous for belief, but then strengthens
his faith by recollecting some others which are more marvelous
still, as the following passage will illustrate.<a id="FNanchor_1222" href="#Footnote_1222" class="fnanchor">[1222]</a> The
experimenters have put in their books the marvelous statement
that the presence of a serpent or of a reed containing
some quicksilver affects sorcerers and magicians so that their
juggleries and incantations are of no avail. William, who
it will be recalled had elsewhere denied the ability of a magic
figure to stop a mill-wheel, is also inclined to question
whether serpents or quicksilver have any power over evil
spirits and incantations. But then he remembers that the
experimenters also assert that a crab hung in mid-air keeps
moles who move underground out of the field and that the
herb peony drives devils out of demoniacs. Since the peony
has many virtues necessary for men and demons hate men,
William thinks it likely that they hate the herb too, and flee
from it, when it is suspended about one’s neck. And in one
of the books of the Hebrews it is expressly stated that one of
the holy angels said that the top of the heart of a certain fish
placed on live coals would drive any kind of demon out of
men or women. This book is received as authentic by both
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</span>
Hebrews and Christians, and William also regards an archangel
as a good authority. This being established, he sees
no reason why a snake may not have power over demons too.
He recalls too the ancient belief among the Romans that
human urine dissolves all works of magic; the manifest fact
that jasper drives away snakes and that eagles place it in
their nests for this reason; and that the gem achates or agate
taken powdered in drink causes the unchaste to vomit. In
Great Britain they test the morals of boys and girls by this
experiment. This property of the agate causes William to
marvel much, for he sees no connection between stones and
virginity. However, if the agate is incompatible with unchastity,
what wonder if quicksilver will not tolerate the
working of magic in its presence?</p>

<p>It has been made evident that William accepts very extreme
powers in natural objects and that with such resources
the possibilities of his natural magic should be well-nigh unlimited.
If he does not quite believe in all these marvels, he
does not definitely deny them, and evidently enjoys repeating
them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Divination
not an art
but revelation.</div>

<p>William states that the proper meaning of divination is
imitation of the deity, but that the term is usually not applied
to the revelations made by good spirits and prophets but to
the revelation of hidden things, especially the future, by evil
spirits.<a id="FNanchor_1223" href="#Footnote_1223" class="fnanchor">[1223]</a> For he also affirms that divination is not a human
art but a matter of revelation. The medical prognostications
of physicians, although they may seem occult to other men,
are based on experience of their art and astronomers are not
called diviners but men of learning. While William may
deny that the diviner is an <i>artifex</i>, he has to admit that some
diviners use tools or materials and so give their predictions
the appearance of being based upon some art.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Divination
by inspection
of
lucid
surfaces.</div>

<p>Of this type is the practice of predicting the future by
gazing upon polished and reflecting surfaces which are
rubbed with oil to increase their lucidity.<a id="FNanchor_1224" href="#Footnote_1224" class="fnanchor">[1224]</a> Among the substances
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</span>
employed are mirrors, two-edged swords, children’s
finger-nails, egg shells, and ivory handles. Usually a boy
or a virgin is employed to gaze thereupon, and sometimes
exorcisms, adjurations, and observance of times are added.
William affirms that many experiences have demonstrated
that only one boy out of seven or ten sees anything therein,
and he is of the opinion that the whole apparatus simply conceals
“the impiety of diabolical sacrifices.” Some ancient
sages, nevertheless, notably Plato, have thought that the soul
of the gazer is thrown back upon itself by the luminosity of
the object seen and then exercises its latent powers of natural
divination. We sometimes see such revelations by the irradiation
of spiritual light in the insane, the very ill, dreamers,
and those in whom because of great fright or care the mind
is abstracted from the body.<a id="FNanchor_1225" href="#Footnote_1225" class="fnanchor">[1225]</a> William therefore finally concludes
that the theory of the philosophers as to divination
by inspection of lucid bodies “is undoubtedly possible,” but
he still maintains that demons are often involved.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Other instances
of
divination,
ancient
and
modern.</div>

<p>William also tells us of an ancient Latin magician who
believed that the soul of an immaculate boy who had been
slain by violence would have knowledge of past, present and
future.<a id="FNanchor_1226" href="#Footnote_1226" class="fnanchor">[1226]</a> He therefore murdered a boy, and then went insane
himself and imagined that he heard responses from the
boy’s soul. This was surely the work of demons. Other
ancient philosophers blinded boys or themselves in order to
increase the power of the soul in divination.<a id="FNanchor_1227" href="#Footnote_1227" class="fnanchor">[1227]</a> William further
mentions the old-wives of his own time who still persisted
in divination and interpreting dreams and could not
be made to desist even by beatings.<a id="FNanchor_1228" href="#Footnote_1228" class="fnanchor">[1228]</a> He states that these old
women still cherished the superstition of the augurs that if
you find a bird’s nest with the mother bird and little ones or
the eggs, and preserve it intact, all will go well with you,
while if you harm it or separate any bird or egg from it you
will encounter ill fortune.<a id="FNanchor_1229" href="#Footnote_1229" class="fnanchor">[1229]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</span></p><div class="sidenote">His treatment
of
astrology.</div>

<p>William has much to say in his various works of the
heavens and the stars, and he rarely overlooks an opportunity
to have a tilt with the astrologers. Most of his statements
and arguments had been often employed before, however,
and he also repeats himself a great deal, and his long-drawn
scholastic listing and rebutting of supposed reasons pro and
con at times becomes insufferably tedious. We shall therefore
compress his treatment to a very small space compared
to that which it occupies in his own works and words.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The philosophers
on the nature
of the
heavens
and stars.</div>

<p>William states that Plato and Aristotle, Boethius, Hermes
Trismegistus, and Avicenna, all believed the stars to be
divine animals whose souls were as superior to ours, as their
celestial bodies are.<a id="FNanchor_1230" href="#Footnote_1230" class="fnanchor">[1230]</a> Since these philosophers regarded the
stars as nobler, wiser, and more powerful than mortals, they
made them guardians and guides of humanity, and distributed
all earthly objects under their rule. Such doctrines William
recalls examining when he was young in the books of
judicial astrology and the volumes of magicians and sorcerers,
from whom he would appear to distinguish the above-named
philosophers none too carefully. He indeed explicitly
classes “Plato and Aristotle and their followers” with “those
who believe in judgments of the stars.”<a id="FNanchor_1231" href="#Footnote_1231" class="fnanchor">[1231]</a> He also tells us
that Plato regarded the entire universe as one divine animal,
and that his followers regarded the tides as the breathing of
this world animal; but that Aristotle and his school included
only what is above the moon or even only the heaven of the
fixed stars.<a id="FNanchor_1232" href="#Footnote_1232" class="fnanchor">[1232]</a> Avicenna, too, called the heaven an animal
obedient to God.</p>

<div class="sidenote">William’s
own opinion
and
attitude.</div>

<p>William himself is inclined to think that the divisions
and diversities of the nine spheres militate against their being
animated by a single soul; and he rejects the theory that
the world soul is composed of number and musical consonance.<a id="FNanchor_1233" href="#Footnote_1233" class="fnanchor">[1233]</a>
But he leaves Christians free, if they will, to believe
with the Aristotelians and many Italian philosophers that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</span>
the superior world is either one or many animals, that the
heavens are either animated or rational.<a id="FNanchor_1234" href="#Footnote_1234" class="fnanchor">[1234]</a> In this he sees no
peril to the Faith; but hitherto Hebrew and Christian doctrine
has not explored such matters, and Christians have
been too absorbed in saving men’s souls to note whether the
heavens had souls or no. It would indeed be strange if
William denied the starry heavens some sort of soul or souls
when he has attributed one to a sea-fish like the echinus.<a id="FNanchor_1235" href="#Footnote_1235" class="fnanchor">[1235]</a>
But he declares that “it is manifest that human souls are
nobler than those which they put in heavenly bodies.” And
he warns against the wicked error of identifying the Holy
Spirit with the world soul. We have noted elsewhere his
hostility to the theory of astrological necromancy that the
heavens and stars are full of ministering spirits. He also
contraverts the Aristotelian doctrines that there are as many
intelligences moving the heavenly bodies as there are celestial
motions and that the heavens love superior intelligences and
strive to become assimilated to these.<a id="FNanchor_1236" href="#Footnote_1236" class="fnanchor">[1236]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Objection
to stars
as cause
of evil.</div>

<p>Like most Christian apologists William adopts the
argument that the stars, if rational, would not cause evils
and misfortunes such as astrologers predict, and seems to
think that all the evil in the world can be charged to the account
of human perversity or the imperfections inherent in
the matter of our inferior world, and that for these two
sources of ill neither God nor the stars should be held responsible.<a id="FNanchor_1237" href="#Footnote_1237" class="fnanchor">[1237]</a>
He recognizes, it is true, that someone may
argue that these evils exist by the will of the Creator, whose
will is nevertheless always good, but he does not seem to see
that the same reasoning may be applied to the rule of the
stars. He seems to regard as a new discovery of his own
and a point hitherto unrecognized by astrologers, the argument
that ineptitude on the part of inferior matter receiving
the force of the stars may account for many effects apparently
due to the heavens. But in thinking this argument
novel he is much mistaken. Really his only point here
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</span>
against astrologers is that some of them are careless in their
phraseology and speak of the stars as causing evil, which
he regards as blasphemy of Him who created the stars.
“And all blasphemy against the Creator,” continues William
in a truculent and intolerant tone which reveals the spirit
of the medieval inquisition, “is an impiety to be exterminated
with fire and sword.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Virtues
of the
stars.</div>

<p>William raises certain difficulties in regard to astrological
technique only to answer them himself. And he grants
that fixed stars which seem close together may really be
separated by vast distances and so have very different virtue.
And he cannot deny “many marvelous and occult virtues” in
celestial bodies, when he admits “so many and so great occult
virtues” in terrestrial bodies. Indeed all philosophers
agree that the virtues of the stars far surpass even those of
precious stones. The variations in the heat of the sun, while
its course continues constant, seem to William a sure indication
that the other planets and fixed stars participate in influencing
our world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Extent of
their influence
upon
nature
and man.</div>

<p>While William was not unwilling to concede souls or
reason to the stars, he believes that it is perilous for Christians
to regard the souls of the heavens as “governors of
inferior things and especially of human affairs.”<a id="FNanchor_1238" href="#Footnote_1238" class="fnanchor">[1238]</a> Those
who hold that man’s actions are caused of necessity by the
motion of the sky and the positions of the stars, ruin, in his
opinion, the foundations of law and morality.<a id="FNanchor_1239" href="#Footnote_1239" class="fnanchor">[1239]</a> “Against
that error, one ought not so much to dispute with arguments
as fight with fire and sword.” Some have argued that because
stars and lights were created before vegetation, animal
life, and human beings, they are causes of these others, both
generating and regulating them.<a id="FNanchor_1240" href="#Footnote_1240" class="fnanchor">[1240]</a> In favor of this contention
so much has been written that it can scarcely be read,
says William, and the stars do give much aid in generation
and in conservation of generated things, but not so much as
the astrologers think.<a id="FNanchor_1241" href="#Footnote_1241" class="fnanchor">[1241]</a> They should not be consulted even
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</span>
as signs&mdash;rather than causes&mdash;in human concerns.<a id="FNanchor_1242" href="#Footnote_1242" class="fnanchor">[1242]</a> In our
sublunar world their power extends only to the four elements
and four humors and only to such animals composed of
these as lack free will and obey natural necessity. Thus William
really excludes only human free will and intellect from
sidereal control,<a id="FNanchor_1243" href="#Footnote_1243" class="fnanchor">[1243]</a> and he admits that “the multitude and populace
from want of intelligence and other evil dispositions
lives almost after the manner of brutes,” following natural
impulse to a great extent, so that astrologers may predict
popular agitations and mob uprisings with a fair degree of
accuracy, but should not predict concerning individuals.
Even in the case of individuals, however, he does not deny
that natural virtues and vices are attributable to the stars,
such vices, for instance, as irascibility, levity, and lubricity,
which medical authorities ascribe not to moral fault but
physical constitution.<a id="FNanchor_1244" href="#Footnote_1244" class="fnanchor">[1244]</a> William would limit the influence of
the stars not only by individual freedom of the will but by
the power of prayer.<a id="FNanchor_1245" href="#Footnote_1245" class="fnanchor">[1245]</a> He does not believe the decrees of
fate so fixed and the laws of nature so unchangeable that
God’s wrath may not be placated by prayer, and freedom
from any threatening evil obtained from His goodness. Belief
in the power of the stars and belief in the power of
prayers: which is the more superstitious, which the more
nearly scientific? Or which belief has led to progress in
science?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Against
nativities,
interrogations,
and
images.</div>

<p>William complains that “Ptolemy and Haly and other
astronomers” have attributed original sin and all its consequences
to the constellations and hours of nativity, in that
they have presumed to write books of horoscopes and nativities.<a id="FNanchor_1246" href="#Footnote_1246" class="fnanchor">[1246]</a>
He feels it “necessary to say something against
that insanity” because of the great reputation such famous
writers have among the “simple and stupid multitude” which
regards them as profound sages and sublime prophets. Into
William’s particular arguments against the art of casting
nativities, which much resemble the arguments of Augustine
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</span>
and John of Salisbury, we will not go. Elsewhere he also attacks
the practice of interrogations.<a id="FNanchor_1247" href="#Footnote_1247" class="fnanchor">[1247]</a> He also strongly objects
to the books which he says astrologers have written
on discovering men’s secret thoughts through the significations
of the stars.<a id="FNanchor_1248" href="#Footnote_1248" class="fnanchor">[1248]</a></p>

<p>William has much to say against astrological images, but
his attitude has already been partially indicated in stating
his attitude towards images, figures, and characters in general.
He declares that belief in astrological images “derogates
more from the honor and glory of the Creator than
the error which attributes such virtue to the stars and luminaries
themselves.” It seems to him “a strange and quite
intolerable error to think that stars which cannot help themselves
can bestow such gifts as invincibility, social graces,
temperance or chastity.”<a id="FNanchor_1249" href="#Footnote_1249" class="fnanchor">[1249]</a> Yet elsewhere we have heard him
mention with seeming complaisance the bestowal of riches
and checking of evil passions by emeralds and topazes. His
best argument as against figures and characters in general
is that such lifeless bodies cannot produce intellectual and
moral effects in living human beings, especially when the
engraved gems are, as is usual, hidden away somewhere, or
buried underground.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Astrology
and religion
and
history.</div>

<p>William condemns as error the association of the world’s
leading religions with the planets, as Judaism with Saturn,
Islam with Venus, and Christianity with the sun.<a id="FNanchor_1250" href="#Footnote_1250" class="fnanchor">[1250]</a> The
stars, he declares, are subject to religion, not religion to the
stars, and Joshua made even the sun and moon stand still.
William is candid enough to recognize that the seven-branched
candlestick in the Jewish tabernacle designated the
seven planets, but elsewhere states that the Mosaic Law forbade
observation of the stars.<a id="FNanchor_1251" href="#Footnote_1251" class="fnanchor">[1251]</a> William also considers the
doctrine of the <i>magnus annus</i> or Platonic year, that after
36,000 solar years history will repeat itself down to the
minutest detail owing to the recurrence of the former series
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</span>
of positions of the constellations.<a id="FNanchor_1252" href="#Footnote_1252" class="fnanchor">[1252]</a> Since this has the support
of men of great reputation, he lists various arguments
advanced in its favor and rebuts them in detail.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Comets
and the
star of
Bethlehem.</div>

<p>William believes that comets appear in the sky and in
the air “as signs of slaughters and other great events in the
world.” He mentions “the universal belief” that they foretell
the deaths of kings and political changes.<a id="FNanchor_1253" href="#Footnote_1253" class="fnanchor">[1253]</a> But he asserts
that the star announcing Christ’s birth was not of this
sort and that the darkness at the time of the Crucifixion was
not due to an ordinary eclipse.</p>

the volume, pp. 561-1012. My
references will be to this edition
and to the <i>De universo</i> unless

it&mdash;and in such other editions of

very poor guides to the contents,
especially if the chapter is of any
length. There are at Paris thirteenth
century MSS of the <i>De

and <i>De universo</i> (BN 15756).</p>

<p>The chief secondary work on
William of Auvergne is Noel
Valois, <i>Guillaume d’Auvergne</i>,
Paris, 1880. One chapter is devoted
to his attitude to the superstitions
of his age, and goes to
the other extreme from Daunou,
HL XVIII, 375, whom Valois
criticizes for calling William extremely
credulous. The inadequacy
of Valois’ chapter, at least
from our standpoint, may be inferred
from his total omission of
William’s conception of “natural
magic.” Valois has no treatment
of William’s attitude to natural
science but contents himself with
a discussion of his philosophy and
psychology. (See also M. Baumgartner,
<i>Die Erkenntnislehre des
Wilhelm von Auvergne</i>, Münster,
1893.) The chapter on William’s
attitude to superstition is largely
given over to examples of popular
superstitions in the thirteenth
century, supplementing legends of
Brittany and other stories told by
William with similar anecdotes
from the pages of Stephen of
Bourbon, Caesar of Heisterbach,
and Gervaise of Tilbury. Valois’
citations of William’s works are
from an edition in which the
pages were numbered differently
from those in the one I used.</p>

connection (I-i-46, pp. 625-26)
William inconsistently makes
the assertion that everything depends
absolutely upon God’s will
alone as an argument against employing
magic images to gain one’s
ends. He tells a story of a man
who, when a magician offered to
secure him some great dignity in
his city, asked him if he could get
it against God’s will. When the
magician admitted that he could
not, the man asked if he could
prevent securing it if God willed it
and the magician again answered
“No.” The man then said that he
would commit it all to God. William
does not seem to see that this
attitude is the same as that of
ignorant persons who leave scientific
investigation to God or of
hungry people who expect God to
feed them.</p>

Paris in 1240 by William as bishop
the seventh was “that neither
glorified souls nor glorious or
glorified bodies will be in the
empyrean heaven with the angels
but in the watery or crystalline
(heaven) which is above the
firmament. Which they even presume
to say of the blessed virgin.
On the contrary it should be believed
that there is the same place
for holy angels and souls of the
blest, namely, the empyrean
heaven,” etc.</p>

<p>The eighth error was “that an
angel can in the same instant be
in different places and is everywhere
if he wishes to be everywhere.”</p>

<p>These errors and various other
sets of errors condemned at Paris
and Oxford are printed in an incunabulum

<div class="sidenote"><i>De natura
rerum</i>;
Date, authorship,
and relation
to
similar
works.</div>

<p>We now approach the consideration of two works with
titles similar to Alexander Neckam’s <i>On the Natures of
Things</i>, namely, Thomas of Cantimpré’s <i>On the Nature of
Things</i><a id="FNanchor_1254" href="#Footnote_1254" class="fnanchor">[1254]</a> and Bartholomew of England’s <i>On the Properties
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</span>
of Things</i>. These two works are much longer and more
elaborate than Neckam’s, containing each nineteen books,
whereas of his five books only two really dealt with the
natures of things, and they lead up to the later and still better
known natural encyclopedia of Vincent of Beauvais.
Thomas and Bartholomew were contemporaries and it is difficult
to say whose book was finished or appeared first but we
shall consider Thomas first. As he says that he spent fourteen
or fifteen years in collecting his material, he perhaps
began to write first and his work seems to reflect a somewhat
less developed state of learning. Thomas is later than
Michael Scot whom he cites, while an allusion to Jacques de
Vitry as the most recent of his authorities and as now bishop
of Tusculum and a cardinal indicates that the work was
finished between 1228 and 1244. On the whole Thomas and
Bartholomew seem to have compiled their works independently,
employing different general plans, emphasizing rather
different fields, and using somewhat different authorities.
Possibly, therefore, the two works may have been completed
almost simultaneously, and one wonders whether they
may not have represented rival ventures of the two friar
orders. Bormans and Rose<a id="FNanchor_1255" href="#Footnote_1255" class="fnanchor">[1255]</a> after him have dwelt on the use
made of Thomas’s compilation by his fellow Dominicans,
Vincent of Beauvais and Albertus Magnus, but I have little
doubt that most of his sources were known to them directly.
The <i>De natura rerum</i> remained long in use; an official price
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</span>
was fixed for it at the University of Paris in the reign of
Philip the Fair;<a id="FNanchor_1256" href="#Footnote_1256" class="fnanchor">[1256]</a> and the manuscripts of it are numerous
and widespread, but as yet often unidentified because in the
manuscripts themselves it is either anonymous or ascribed to
Albertus Magnus.<a id="FNanchor_1257" href="#Footnote_1257" class="fnanchor">[1257]</a> This attribution to Albert is found even
in a manuscript of the thirteenth century, while “Albert in
the book <i>De naturis rerum</i>,” is cited in the <i>Thesaurus pauperum</i><a id="FNanchor_1258" href="#Footnote_1258" class="fnanchor">[1258]</a>
by Petrus Hispanus, a work written at some time
before 1277 when its author died as Pope John XXI. But
Thomas himself speaks in the <i>Bonum universale de apibus</i><a id="FNanchor_1259" href="#Footnote_1259" class="fnanchor">[1259]</a>
of the <i>De natura rerum</i> as an earlier work of his, which
seems decisive, and he is also credited with the authorship
of both these works in the fourteenth century Dominican
bibliography. A critical edition of the <i>De natura rerum</i>
would be a valuable contribution to the study of medieval
learning.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Life of
Thomas.</div>

<p>The date of the birth of Thomas in Brabant has not
been fixed but seems to lie between the years 1186 and 1210
and probably is close to the latter date. He attended the episcopal
school at Liège for eleven years and entered the Dominican
order in 1232. He states that he was in Paris in
1238 when William of Auvergne as bishop of that city called
a meeting of all the masters in the chapter house of the Friars
Preachers to consider the abuse of plurality of benefices.<a id="FNanchor_1260" href="#Footnote_1260" class="fnanchor">[1260]</a>
In 1246 he became subprior and lector of the Dominicans at
Louvain. Kaufmann placed the date of his death between
1263 and 1293, but if the date 1276 mentioned in his <i>Bonum
universale de apibus</i> is correct,<a id="FNanchor_1261" href="#Footnote_1261" class="fnanchor">[1261]</a> he was alive then. In that
work he seems to refer to Aquinas and Albertus Magnus as
both still living,<a id="FNanchor_1262" href="#Footnote_1262" class="fnanchor">[1262]</a> but the former had already completed his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</span>
studies with Albert and become a professor of theology himself,<a id="FNanchor_1263" href="#Footnote_1263" class="fnanchor">[1263]</a>
while Albert is spoken of as if an old man.<a id="FNanchor_1264" href="#Footnote_1264" class="fnanchor">[1264]</a> Thomas
says that he was an attendant upon his lectures “for a long
while” when he occupied the chair of theology. It does not
seem, however, that this passage implies any very close relation
of discipleship between Thomas and Albert.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Character
of the
<i>De natura
rerum</i>.</div>

<p>The <i>De natura rerum</i> is professedly a handy compilation
made from numerous other writings, as Thomas states both
in his preface and conclusion. Stimulated by the remark in
Augustine’s <i>Christian Doctrine</i> that it would be a splendid
achievement if someone should collect in one volume data
concerning the natures of things and especially of animals,
Thomas has spared neither labor, solicitude, nor expense
toward that end and has spent fourteen or fifteen years in
collecting material “scattered widely over the world in the
diverse writings” of many philosophers and authors. He has
not been satisfied to pursue his investigations merely in Gaul
and Germany, although books abound in those countries, but
has gone beyond the sea and collected the books published
in England on nature, and has made excerpts from all
sources. He asks indulgence of his readers if he has omitted
anything that should be included, reminding them how great
a task it is for one man to read and digest all the varied and
scattered works of the philosophers. Nevertheless he feels
that “there will scarcely be found among the Latins so much
and so varied material compressed into a single volume.”<a id="FNanchor_1265" href="#Footnote_1265" class="fnanchor">[1265]</a>
Thomas does not directly state as his aim, although it is
perhaps involved in his citation of Augustine, the elucidation
of the properties of things mentioned in the Bible, as
we shall find that Bartholomew of England does. But he
expresses a hope that arguments for the Faith and illustrations
serviceable in sermons may be derived from his work,
and there are a number of little books in existence in manuscript
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</span>
which seem to be extracts from the works of Thomas
or Bartholomew intended for pulpit use.<a id="FNanchor_1266" href="#Footnote_1266" class="fnanchor">[1266]</a> Thomas will
sometimes, moreover, like Alexander Neckam, explain the
allegorical or moral significance of natural phenomena, “but
not continually, because we have tried to avoid prolixity.”
As a matter of fact, it is rarely that he does so,<a id="FNanchor_1267" href="#Footnote_1267" class="fnanchor">[1267]</a> although the
amount of allegory or moralizing varies somewhat in different
manuscripts. These also differ as to the fulness of the
text generally and there are numerous minor differences,
certain passages being abbreviated or entirely omitted in
some manuscripts. Copies have also been discovered of a
second or revised edition in which a twentieth book has been
added.<a id="FNanchor_1268" href="#Footnote_1268" class="fnanchor">[1268]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Plan and
contents.</div>

<p>The manuscripts also differ in their arrangement of the
work, but as Thomas supplies us with a table of contents,
there can be no doubt as to the original and correct order.
He begins with the parts of the human body, devoting a
chapter to each member, its ills and their cure, and having
considerable to say on the subject of obstetrics. His second
book discusses the soul (<i>anima</i>). The brief third book
treats of strange and monstrous races of men who are found
chiefly in the orient but in some cases elsewhere, hermaphrodites,
for instance, in France. Then come successive books
on quadrupeds, birds, marine monsters, fish, serpents, and
worms. These six books devoted to animal life other than
man occupy considerably more than half of the entire work.
Thomas turns next to the vegetable kingdom, devoting two
books to trees, of which the second deals with aromatic and
medicinal trees, and one book to herbs. After the brief
thirteenth book on fountains and other bodies of water he
comes to (14) precious stones, (15) the seven metals, (16)
the seven regions of air, (17) the sphere and planets, (18)
meteorology, and finally to the universe and four elements.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</span>
These two topics of his nineteenth book are usually discussed
near the start of medieval scientific treatises, and the reason
for the order adopted by Thomas is not very evident, unless
perhaps he at first intended to write about animals alone and
then added further books on other subjects, or unless he
decided to begin with man the microcosm and end with the
<i>mundus</i> or macrocosm. If such was his plan, he does not
seem to say so, and it is hardly surprising that liberties were
taken with his order in some of the manuscripts, which begin
with book sixteen and end with book fifteen, apparently in
order to start with the heavens and elements and then consider
the particular creatures of inferior creation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Chief authorities.</div>

<p>As the work of Thomas is professedly a compilation, it
is important to note his authorities. At the start he mentions
those to whom he is most indebted: first, Aristotle,
and then Pliny. Third comes the <i>De mirabilibus</i> (instead
of <i>memorabilibus</i>) <i>mundi</i> of Solinus whom Thomas esteems
both as a man of marvelous eloquence and as a diligent
scrutinizer of the natures of things. Very different this from
Albertus Magnus’ sceptical estimate of Solinus as a philosopher
who told many lies, and yet there are modern scholars
who contend that Albert took much of his natural science
ready-made and without acknowledgment from the <i>De
natura rerum</i> of his pupil<a id="FNanchor_1269" href="#Footnote_1269" class="fnanchor">[1269]</a> Thomas. It will be noted that
Thomas names his chief authorities in chronological order.
Fourth comes Ambrose, to whose eloquent description of
birds and beasts in the <i>Hexaemeron</i> Thomas finds it necessary,
however, to make additions; and fifth, Isidore. Sixth,
and most recent in time, is the <i>Oriental History</i> of Jacques
de Vitry to whom Thomas “was intimately devoted.”<a id="FNanchor_1270" href="#Footnote_1270" class="fnanchor">[1270]</a>
Jacques had occupied several chapters of his <i>Oriental History</i><a id="FNanchor_1271" href="#Footnote_1271" class="fnanchor">[1271]</a>
with the fountains, trees and herbs, animals, serpents,
birds, and rare fish, precious stones and strange races of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</span>
orient, and had then added a briefer list to show that the
west, too, was not without its marvels. Thomas also mentions
two anonymous works, which he appears to cite chiefly
concerning animals<a id="FNanchor_1272" href="#Footnote_1272" class="fnanchor">[1272]</a> and whose titles he gives as <i>Experimentator</i>
and <i>Liber rerum</i>. Thomas was probably correct
in his surmise that <i>Experimentator</i> had been compiled in
recent times and we shall meet citations of it in other authors
of the thirteenth century. But the original texts of the <i>Liber
rerum</i> and <i>Experimentator</i> do not seem to have survived.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Embodiment
of
long
extracts.</div>

<p>Thomas mentions yet other authorities in his preface
and even more in the course of his work. His method in
using his sources varies. Sometimes he combines in one
paragraph brief statements from a number of authorities
bearing on the same topic. Again he may insert practically
<i>verbatim</i> a long extract or complete treatment of a
matter by some one author, or even an entire treatise such
as the <i>Letter of Alexander to Aristotle</i> or Thetel’s discussion
of seals in stones. Thus in his first book on the human
body he uses a work supposed to have been written by Cleopatra
to her daughter on the subject of gynecology, and
inserts in condensed form John of Spain’s translation from
the Arabic of the medical portion of <i>The Secret of Secrets</i>
supposed to have been written by Aristotle to Alexander.
His second book on the soul follows Augustine’s treatise
<i>De anima</i>. His third book on strange and monstrous races
of men includes also some account of the Gymnosophists
and Brahmans and their verbal repartee or epistolary correspondence
with Alexander of Macedon.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Other
citations.</div>

<p>With some of the authors whom he names Thomas was
almost surely not directly acquainted. Dorotheus the
Athenian, Menander, and Mago, for instance, he mentions
as “authorities according to Pliny.” He does not seem to
make as much use of Galen as might be expected, were that
author’s works already accessible in Latin translation; but
he probably had the old Latin version of Alexander Tralles,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</span>
to whom he probably refers as “<i>Alexander medicus</i>.” He
probably also had seen Basil’s <i>Hexaemeron</i> in Latin translation,
since he cites it as well as Ambrose a number of
times, and also in the preface to his <i>Bonum universale de
apibus</i> lists “the great Basil” together with Aristotle, Solinus,
Pliny, Ambrose, and Jacques de Vitry as his authorities in
the discussion of bees in the <i>De natura rerum</i>. Many other
writers he has without much doubt read for himself:
Boethius, Martianus Capella, and Rabanus of earlier medieval
Latin writers; Platearius and Constantinus Africanus
in medicine; Aldhelme<a id="FNanchor_1273" href="#Footnote_1273" class="fnanchor">[1273]</a> and <i>Physiologus</i> on animals; of
the Arabs Alfraganus, Albumasar, and perhaps Averroës.
Michael Scot seems to be cited in some manuscripts and
not in others.<a id="FNanchor_1274" href="#Footnote_1274" class="fnanchor">[1274]</a> In treating of stones Thomas does not cite
Marbod by name but states that he is using the metrical
version of the account which Evax, king of Arabia, is said
to have written for the emperor Nero. Thomas, however,
adds statements from other authors on stones. Like Alexander
Neckam Thomas seems to use the <i>Natural Questions</i>
of Adelard of Bath without acknowledgment. In discussing
herbs he asks the three opening questions of Adelard’s
treatise and proceeds to solve them in words which are often
identical. After this general introduction his chapters on
particular herbs are almost invariably introduced by the
formula, “As Platearius says.” Ferckel has pointed out
that the greater part of three chapters in his first book on
human anatomy is drawn from the <i>Philosophia</i> of William
of Conches,<a id="FNanchor_1275" href="#Footnote_1275" class="fnanchor">[1275]</a> and that the twentieth book, added in some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</span>
manuscripts, is taken from the same work. Thus Thomas
makes much use of comparatively recent authorities. He
also tells us that he has not disdained to include some popular
beliefs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Credulous
attitude.</div>

<p>Thomas of Cantimpré must be reckoned as one of the
most credulous of our authors. In his books on animals he
seems of the uncritical school of the marvelous of Solinus,
Basil, Ambrose, the <i>Physiologus</i>, and Jacques de Vitry.
Seldom does he question any statement that he finds in
his authorities; indeed, he does not appear to possess the independent
knowledge of animal life to enable him to do
so. He does state that the power of the little <i>echinus</i> to
stop ships has seemed incredible to many, but inasmuch as
Ambrose, Jacques, Aristotle, Isidore, and Basil all assert it
confidently, he does not see how there is any room left for
doubt.<a id="FNanchor_1276" href="#Footnote_1276" class="fnanchor">[1276]</a> The story of the beaver’s self-castration in order
to escape its hunters is given without comment, and we
are further told that the animal cannot live unless it keeps
its tail in the water.<a id="FNanchor_1277" href="#Footnote_1277" class="fnanchor">[1277]</a> Thomas tells us that Isidore held that
the Sirens were really harlots who enticed men to moral
ruin, but he adds that the more general opinion is that they
are irrational marine monsters who still exist and he cites
“those who testify that they have seen the Sirens themselves.”
Their song is more like that of birds than it is
like articulate speech. Sometimes, on the other hand,
Thomas prefers a miraculous or supernatural to a natural
explanation of a marvelous statement. He is not sure
whether the onocentaur seen by St. Anthony in the desert
was real or a deception of the devil, and he regards as not
natural but a divine miracle the story that the Apostle Peter
had shut up in a mountain near Rome a dragon which will
live until the end of the world. He adds, however, the
tale of the two dragons found alive under the tower from
the <i>History of the Britons</i>. About all that can be said for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</span>
Thomas on this score is that he does not appear to add many
new marvels of his own to the incredible assertions of past
writers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Very
uncritical
character
of the
<i>Bonum
universale
de apibus</i>.</div>

<p>Thomas’s credulity seems to have increased with age,
since his later <i>Bonum universale de apibus</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1278" href="#Footnote_1278" class="fnanchor">[1278]</a> in which bees
are a mere starting point for a disquisition on the qualities
which bishops and other clergy should possess and the introduction
of innumerable anecdotes, is a tissue of monkish
tales and gossip, instances of special providence, apparitions
of the dead and of demons, and other miracles and moralities,
most of which are supposed to have occurred in
Thomas’s own time and are recounted upon hearsay. Thus
we read of a son who did not adequately support his aged
father and was punished by a toad leaping onto his face and
taking such a hold that it could not be removed but remained
as a disfiguring growth. As a penance the son was
sent by his bishop through the diocese as an example and
warning to others. Or Thomas assures us that Albertus
Magnus told him that at Paris the demon appeared to him
in the form of a fellow friar in an effort to call him away
from his studies, but departed by virtue of the sign of
the cross. In short, the work is on the same order as the
<i>Dialogues</i> of Gregory the Great.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A chapter
on the
lion.</div>

<p>Thomas’s treatment of animals in general and quadrupeds
in particular can perhaps best be illustrated by a
paraphrase of some one chapter entire, for which purpose I
have selected that on the lion. It will be noted that there
is no apparent logic in the order of the statements which
I have had to divide into paragraphs rather arbitrarily. It
has seemed fairer, however, to reproduce the order unchanged
than to bring together scattered statements bearing
on the same point. Many of Thomas’s statements are found
also in Aristotle’s <i>History of Animals</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1279" href="#Footnote_1279" class="fnanchor">[1279]</a> although Thomas’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</span>
citations would indicate that some items, at least, were derived
by him from that source only indirectly.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Different
kinds of
lions:
their generation.</div>

<p>The lion, as Jacques and Solinus state, is called the king
of animals. There are three kinds of lions. Many are short
and have curly manes but are weak and cowardly. Those
generated by pards are ignoble and degenerate and have
no manes. The larger ones with ordinary manes are noble
and keen and without guile or suspicion. The lion’s brow

breast and forefoot and tail.<a id="FNanchor_1280" href="#Footnote_1280" class="fnanchor">[1280]</a> And he is stout-hearted.<a id="FNanchor_1281" href="#Footnote_1281" class="fnanchor">[1281]</a>
He is so hot of nature that he is said to have sexual intercourse
at all times.<a id="FNanchor_1282" href="#Footnote_1282" class="fnanchor">[1282]</a> The lioness bears first five, then four,
then three, then two cubs, then only one, after which she
becomes sterile.<a id="FNanchor_1283" href="#Footnote_1283" class="fnanchor">[1283]</a> Aristotle accounts for this by the great
heat attending the generation of lions who have solider and
stronger bodies for their size than other animals. The
lioness has only two tits and not corresponding in size to
her body. This is not because she has so few cubs but because
she eats only flesh which does not readily turn into
milk.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Disposition
and
behavior.</div>

<p>Solinus says that the lion is not easily enraged, but
when anyone does provoke him he shows no mercy to his
adversary. On the other hand, he spares the prostrate captive
and allows those whom he meets by chance to proceed
on their way.<a id="FNanchor_1284" href="#Footnote_1284" class="fnanchor">[1284]</a> He is fiercer to men than to women, and to
women who have had intercourse with men than to virgins
and children. Adelinus says that he sleeps with his eyes
open. Pliny says that as he walks he obliterates his tracks
with his tail in order to foil his hunters. Lions do not fight
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</span>
among themselves.<a id="FNanchor_1285" href="#Footnote_1285" class="fnanchor">[1285]</a> Solinus<a id="FNanchor_1286" href="#Footnote_1286" class="fnanchor">[1286]</a> says that if hunted in the
open, the lion will wait for the dogs and dissimulate his
fear, but in the woods, where no one can see his cowardice,
will take to his heels. When pursuing his prey he leaps into
the air in order to see farther, but not when he is fleeing.
Aristotle states that the lion and Arabian camel are the only
quadrupeds to move the right foot first. In making water
the lion lifts his foot like a dog. When the lion opens his
mouth a strong odor exudes. “The lion, very swift by fortitude,
is somewhat heavy of nature because of its slow digestion.”
When running, it cannot come to a stop the instant
it wishes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fear inspired
and

lions.</div>

<p>When about to drink, the lion draws a wide circle with
its tail and roars so that the other animals dare not cross
this line.<a id="FNanchor_1287" href="#Footnote_1287" class="fnanchor">[1287]</a> Ambrose tells a marvel to the effect that many
animals which are swift enough to evade the lion’s onset are
paralyzed by the sound of its roar. As king of beasts the
lion scorns the society of the other animals and will not
touch meat which is a day old.<a id="FNanchor_1288" href="#Footnote_1288" class="fnanchor">[1288]</a> But it fears a scorpion.
According to the <i>Liber rerum</i>, some say that the lion is consumed
internally by its own fury and fiery blood, even when
it does not have the appearance of being angry. Solinus
says that a lion in captivity fears the sound of wheels but
dreads a fire still more. Jacques says that it is also afraid
of a white cock. Pliny says that a captive lion can be tamed
by seeing its cub whipped or by watching a dog obey a man.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Their
diet, medicine,
and
mode of
fighting.</div>

<p>Lions are never found overladen with fat. They take
food or drink on alternate days, and fast if their digestion
fails to operate. If they devour too much flesh, they put
their claws into their mouths and extract it. The lion has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</span>
a natural enmity for the wild ass. A sick lion eats an ape,
as Ambrose says, or drains a dog’s blood. Pliny tells of a
Syracusan whom a lion persistently followed until he extracted
a splinter from its foot. Another lion insisted on
having a bone removed from its teeth. Some manuscripts<a id="FNanchor_1289" href="#Footnote_1289" class="fnanchor">[1289]</a>
here insert from Pliny and Solinus the tale of the wiles of
the lioness to conceal her amours with the pard, and the
assertion that a lion wags its tail only when in good humor.
When a lion begins to move it beats the ground with its
tail but as it increases its speed lashes its back. When
wounded it always takes note of the man who inflicted the
wound and goes for him. If a man has hurled missiles at
it but failed to hit it, the lion merely knocks him down.
Philosopher says that when fighting for its cubs the lion
keeps its gaze fixed on the ground so as not to be terrified
by the spears of the hunters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Medical
virtues
of the
lion’s
carcass.</div>

<p>Pliny recommends eating the flesh and heart of a lion
to persons afflicted with colds. The lion’s bones are so hard
that they strike fire like flint. The hollow in its bones is
very small and rarely contains any marrow, and then only
in the hip bones, as Experimenter<a id="FNanchor_1290" href="#Footnote_1290" class="fnanchor">[1290]</a> says. Lion’s fat is an
antidote for poisons, and a man anointed with it and wine
puts to flight all beasts and snakes. It is hotter than the fat
of any other quadruped. The lion is almost always feverish,
and that with quartan fever. The effect of its roar upon
other beasts is again mentioned. When crossing hard or
stony ground the lion spares its claws since they are its
weapons. Pliny asserts that lion fat with oil of roses keeps
the face white and free from blotches. The neck bone of
the lion is continuous and the flesh there cartilaginous like
a muscle, so that it cannot turn its neck, a disability which
some, the <i>Liber rerum</i> states, ascribe incorrectly to indignation
or stolidity on the lion’s part. Aristotle says that the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</span>
internal organs and teeth of a lion are like those of a
dog.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Medieval
and modern
encyclopedias
compared.</div>

<p>After this account in the <i>De natura rerum</i> the article on
the lion in the latest edition of the <i>Encyclopedia Britannica</i>
will be found rather dull reading and scanty as concerns the
behavior of lions as well as the medicinal properties of their
carcasses. Almost all of antiquity’s interesting assertions
concerning lions are omitted, no doubt as false, but little
of interest is supplied in their place. We are told a number
of things that the lion will not do: he will not climb,
he will not take more than three bounds after his prey. But
even Thomas does not say that a lion ever climbs; the
notion does not seem even to have occurred to him.<a id="FNanchor_1291" href="#Footnote_1291" class="fnanchor">[1291]</a> Nor
does Thomas assert that all lions are brave or noble or
magnanimous. On the whole, the lion does not seem a subject
upon which modern science has added vastly to our
knowledge. There were far more lions in existence in
antiquity, and men were more interested in them then, and
thought at least that they knew more about them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Examples
of the
zoology
of the
Experimenter.</div>

<p>Some notion of the work ascribed by Thomas to <i>Experimentator</i>
may be gained from Thomas’s citations of it in his
chapter on the wolf. Experimenter explains the fact stated
by Ambrose, that a man who is seen first by a wolf cannot
speak, by arguing that the rays from the wolf’s eyes dry up
the <i>spiritus</i> of human vision which in its turn dries up the
human <i>spiritus</i> generally. Thereby the wind-pipes are dried
up and in consequence the throat so that man cannot speak.
Experimenter states further that the wolf collects willow
leaves in his mouth and makes a pile of them under which he
hides in order to catch goats. And when walking over dry
leaves he licks his paws so that the dogs will not hear him.
An insulting reflection upon the canine sense of smell!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fish,
worms,
and toads.</div>

<p>We will pass over Thomas’s books on birds, marine
monsters, fish, and serpents, except to note in passing that
Delisle credited him with supplying some new information
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</span>
concerning the medieval herring fisheries,<a id="FNanchor_1292" href="#Footnote_1292" class="fnanchor">[1292]</a> and come to
his separate treatment of “worms.” Those with only two
or four feet have a little blood, but those with more feet
than four are bloodless, because the blood is exhausted in
providing nutrition for so many feet and because the motion
of so many feet annihilates the blood. Many worms begin
and end their life in the course of a summer, since they are
born rather from corruption than from seed. Earthworms
in particular are generated from pure and unadulterated
earth with no admixture of <i>semen</i>, and so furnish illustration
and proof of the virgin birth of Christ. In the opinion
of the <i>Liber rerum</i> the toad is a worm. It is venomous
and has a pestilential glance. It feeds on earth, eating as
much as it can clutch in its forefoot, in which it is emblematic
of avarice and cupidity. In Gaul there are big
toads or frogs with a voice like a horn, but they lose their
voice if taken outside of that country, typifying clergymen
who like Jonah will not preach outside of their own land.
Some manuscripts add from “Alexander”<a id="FNanchor_1293" href="#Footnote_1293" class="fnanchor">[1293]</a> that toads are
fond of the plant salvia and that it is sometimes poisoned
by contact with them. Hence it is advised to touch a patch
of salvia with rue, the dew from which is deadly to toads.
A stone found in the head of a toad, if worn by a man, is
an amulet against poison. Several toads can be generated
from the ashes of a toad.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Solomon’s
experiment
in
worms.</div>

<p>In planning to build a temple of fine marbles Solomon
found embarrassing the prohibition in the Mosaic law forbidding
one to cut stones for the altar of the Lord with iron.
But then he sought by an experiment in worms what the art
of man knew not. He shut up the fledglings of an ostrich
in a glass vase, so that the mother bird could see them but
could not get at them to feed them. The ostrich thereupon
flew (?) off to the desert and came back with a worm. It
then broke the glass vase by smearing it with the blood of
this worm. Solomon found this worm, called <i>Thamur</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</span>
or the worm of Solomon, equally efficacious in cutting
marble.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Trees.</div>

<p>In speaking of trees most manuscripts<a id="FNanchor_1294" href="#Footnote_1294" class="fnanchor">[1294]</a> tell of an oak
under which Abraham dwelt and which lasted until Constantine’s
time. The trees in the Garden of Eden or terrestrial
paradise are also discussed, though of course no longer
accessible. Josephus is cited concerning trees near the Red
Sea and apples of Sodom. Thomas thinks that the Sun-tree
and Moon-tree mentioned in Alexander’s letter to Aristotle
had been referred to much earlier in the benediction
of Joseph in <i>Deuteronomy</i>. As for the responses which
these trees are said to have given Alexander, Thomas has
little doubt that this was the work of demons, although some
contend that it was done by divine permission through
ministering angels.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Marvelous
virtues
of stones.</div>

<p>Like Marbod, Thomas points out that, while plants and
fruits receive their virtues “through the medium of the
operations of nature,” no excess of cold or heat can be
observed in stones to account for their miraculous powers,
such as conferring invisibility, and that consequently their
virtues must come direct from God. He alludes to the
belief that Solomon imprisoned demons beneath the gems
in rings, and cites the fifteenth book of <i>The City of God</i>
for the statement that demons are attracted by various
stones, herbs, woods, animals, and incantations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An adamantine
mariner’s
compass.</div>

<p>While Thomas’s exposition of the virtues of gems is
largely based upon Marbod, in discussing <i>adamas</i> or adamant
he introduces a description of the mariner’s compass,
concerning which Marbod is silent and which had probably
not been invented or introduced in western Europe that
early, although Neckam of course alludes to it before
Thomas. After speaking of a variety of adamant which
can be broken without resort to goat’s blood but which
will attract iron even away from the magnet, Thomas adds
that it also betrays the location of the star of the sea which
is called <i>Maria</i>. When sailors cannot direct their course to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</span>
port amid obscure mists, they take a needle and, after rubbing
its point on adamant, fasten it transversely on a small
stick or straw and place it in a vessel full of water. Then
by carrying some adamant around the vessel they start the
needle rotating. Then the stone is suddenly withdrawn and
presently the point of the needle comes to rest pointing
towards the star in question.<a id="FNanchor_1295" href="#Footnote_1295" class="fnanchor">[1295]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
mariner’s
compass
and magic.</div>

<p>Having concluded this description of a mariner’s compass,
Thomas again follows the poem of Marbod and goes
on to say that the adamant is also said to be potent in magic
arts, to make its bearer brave against the enemy, to repel
vain dreams and poison, and to benefit lunatics and
demoniacs. I mention this accidental juxtaposition of the
mariner’s compass and magic because, as we shall find in
the case of Roger Bacon, it has often been stated that those
in possession of the secret of the mariner’s compass were
long afraid to reveal it for fear of being suspected of magic,
or that sailors were at first afraid to employ the new device
for the same reason. This passage in the <i>De natura rerum</i>
is as far as I know the only one in the sources that might
even seem to suggest such a connection, but Thomas does
not really connect the compass and magic at all. Later in
the same book, in discussing the magnet, he says nothing
of the compass, although repeating the usual statements
that the magnet attracts iron, is used in magic, and has
the occult property of revealing an unchaste wife.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Occult
virtues of
sculptured
gems.</div>

<p>After completing his account of the occult virtues of
gems in their natural state, Thomas goes on to discuss the
sculpture of gems and the additional virtues which they
thereby acquire, a subject on which Marbod had not touched.
Thomas had already announced at the beginning of his
book on stones:<a id="FNanchor_1296" href="#Footnote_1296" class="fnanchor">[1296]</a> “Moreover, at the close of this book we
have given certain opinions of the ancients which we think
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</span>
are neither to be credited in every respect nor denied in
every respect, and in this we follow the glorious Augustine.
The children of Israel are said to have carved certain
gems in the desert, especially carnelians, and their work of
sculpture is said to have been of such subtle skill that no
one since has ever dared attempt an imitation of it. And
there is no doubt but that figures and images of figures are
engraved according to the efficacies of the virtues of gems.”
Thomas also admits that the Israelites should have been
adepts in such work, when he recalls the divine direction
which they received in the case of the twelve gems in the
breast-plate of the high priest. “Therefore it is evident
that sculptures are not found on gems without good reason.
On the other hand, I would not say that every such engraving
is a token of mystic virtue.” Later, when he comes to
“the relations of the ancient sculptors concerning the engraving
of gems,” Thomas warns that, although the form
of stones is to be honored for its virtue, “yet hope is not
to be put in them but, according to what is written, in God
alone from whom is derived the virtue of stones and the
dignity of every creature.” The astrological character of
such engraved images is made manifest by the connection
of many of them with the signs of the zodiac.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Thetel on
images on
stones.</div>

<p>Thomas complains that the ancient authorities for such
images and their virtues are often not cited, but he had found
a treatise in which the images which the children of Israel
were supposed to have engraved in the desert were recorded
by a Jewish philosopher named Thetel or Techel.<a id="FNanchor_1297" href="#Footnote_1297" class="fnanchor">[1297]</a> Of this
treatise Thomas makes a Latin translation for his readers,
cautioning them, however, that Thetel’s opinions “are not
to be trusted on every point.” Thetel’s treatise, at least as
it is reproduced by Thomas who, however, has perhaps already
used parts of it in his preceding discussion, begins
with the sentence: “When a jasper is found and on it a
man with a shield about his neck or in his hand and a serpent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</span>
beneath his feet, this has virtue against all enemies.” It
ends with the sentence: “When there is found on a stone
a foaming horse and above a man holding a scepter in his
hand, this is good for those who have power over men.”
These sentences perhaps sufficiently suggest the character
of the work. It is also found separately in the manuscripts
as early as the twelfth century.<a id="FNanchor_1298" href="#Footnote_1298" class="fnanchor">[1298]</a> Some of these vary considerably
from the text as given by Thomas. The popularity
of the treatise is also attested by the allusions in its
prefaces to spurious imitations of it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Zahel or

<p>This Thetel, Techel, or Cehel, with his seals of the
children of Israel, is presumably no other than Zethel or
Zachel or Zahel or Zaël, the Israelite or Ismaelite,<a id="FNanchor_1299" href="#Footnote_1299" class="fnanchor">[1299]</a> some
of whose astrological treatises appeared in early printed
editions,<a id="FNanchor_1300" href="#Footnote_1300" class="fnanchor">[1300]</a> and several of whose works are listed by Albertus

Σὰχλ τοῦ υἱοῦ τοῦ Πέσρ.<a id="FNanchor_1302" href="#Footnote_1302" class="fnanchor">[1302]</a> The translation of his works into
Latin seems to have begun at an early date, as his <i>Fatidica</i>
or <i>Decrees of Fate</i> was translated in 1138 by Hermann of
Dalmatia,<a id="FNanchor_1303" href="#Footnote_1303" class="fnanchor">[1303]</a> while our treatise on seals appears in a twelfth
century manuscript.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</span></p><div class="sidenote">Consecration
of
gems.</div>

<p>Thomas terminates his book on stones by instructions,
quite in the tone of the blessed Hildegard, concerning the
blessing of gems. As a result of Adam’s fall every creature
was corrupted and lost some of its original virtue, and even
such virtues as are left to gems are often further corrupted
by the touch of impious and impure men. Hence, just as
sinful men are renovated by baptism and penance, so gems
can have some of their lost virtues restored by a ceremony
of consecration and sanctification. They should be wrapped
in linen, placed on the altar, and the priest, after saying
mass and while still wearing his sacred robes, should offer
this prayer:</p>

<p>“God, almighty Father, who showed Thy virtue to all
through certain insensible creatures, who bade Thy servant
Moses adorn himself among other holy vestments with
twelve precious stones as a token of judgment, and also
showed the Evangelist John the heavenly city of Jerusalem
eternally constructed of the virtues which these same stones
typify, we humbly beseech Thy Majesty to deign to consecrate
and sanctify these stones by the sanctification and invocation
of Thy Name, that they may be sanctified and
consecrated, and may recover the efficacious virtues with
which the experience of wise men proves Thee to have endowed
them, so that whatever persons may wear them, may
feel Thy virtue present through them and may deserve to
receive the gifts of Thy grace and the protection of Thy
virtue, through Jesus, Thy Son, in whom all sanctification
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</span>
consists, who lives with Thee, and reigns as God through
infinite successions of cycles.”<a id="FNanchor_1304" href="#Footnote_1304" class="fnanchor">[1304]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The seven
metals:
modern
plumbing.</div>

<p>In his book on the seven metals, namely, gold, electrum,
silver, copper, lead, tin, and iron, Thomas alludes to transmutation
in speaking of copper and cites a work of alchemy
ascribed to Aristotle, <i>The Light of Lights (De lumine luminum)</i>,
for the assertion that the best gold is that made from
a boy’s urine and brass. This statement is to be understood,
however, only of the color of the gold and not of the substance.
In his discussion of lead, tin, and iron Thomas cites
no authorities except that once he remarks, “as the philosopher
says.”<a id="FNanchor_1305" href="#Footnote_1305" class="fnanchor">[1305]</a> Perhaps therefore we have here what is
largely a contribution of his own. At any rate it seems to
include the first mention of the invention of modern plumbing.<a id="FNanchor_1306" href="#Footnote_1306" class="fnanchor">[1306]</a>
Tin, Thomas tells us, rusts out easily if it lies long
in water. Therefore the underground pipes of aqueducts
have long been made of lead, but they used to be joined
with tin, but in “modern times” human art has thought out
a method of uniting them with hot molten lead. For while
tin will not remain solid for long, “lead lasts forever underground.”
Thomas goes on to say that lead has the peculiar
property among the metals of always increasing in size.
Like Hildegard, he also mentions steel, which he says is
hardened by many tensions so that it surpasses iron in virtue.
He further tells of an oriental iron<a id="FNanchor_1307" href="#Footnote_1307" class="fnanchor">[1307]</a> which is very good for
cutting and is fusible like copper or silver but not ductile
like the iron in other parts of the world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The seven
regions
of the air.</div>

<p>The discussion in the <i>De natura rerum</i> of the seven
regions of the air and their humors, namely, dew, snow,
hail, rain, “laudanum,” manna and honey, reminds one of
Michael Scot’s treatment of the same subject,<a id="FNanchor_1308" href="#Footnote_1308" class="fnanchor">[1308]</a> but seems to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</span>
be drawn from a common source rather than directly copied
from it. Thomas states that Aristotle has treated more
fully of these humors in his <i>Meteorology</i>, but in reality
Aristotle says nothing of the last three named in the <i>Meteorology</i>,
although in the <i>History of Animals</i> he says that honey
is distilled from the air by the stars. Thomas draws the
same distinction as Michael Scot had made between natural
honey and the artificial sort made by bees. He is willing
to grant that the manna upon which the children of Israel
lived was created in this region of the sky, although especially
prepared for them by a divine miracle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Astrological.</div>

<p>The astrological passages of the <i>De natura rerum</i> are
neither striking nor novel. In his books on animals Thomas
had stated that various animal substances such as the brains
of wolves or the livers of mice vary in size with the waxing
and waning of the moon. He denies that the planets
possess sense or that their movements are voluntary, but
he quotes Pliny’s statement that by the influence of Venus
all things on earth are generated, and states the influence of
each planet when it is in the ascendant. Under Mars men
become choleric and bellicose. Jupiter is such a source of
safety and good health that Martianus declared that were
Jupiter the only planet, men would be immortal. Such, however,
was not the Creator’s will. The word “Jupiter” is not
without reason derived from <i>iubens</i> and <i>pater</i>, since during
the ascension of this planet all terrestrial things are born.
For unless seeds were severed from their beginnings by
some occult virtue, they would always remain immovable in
the state in which they were created. God accordingly put
such power in the spheres of the stars and especially the
planets that created things might obey his command to increase
and multiply. They return, however, to the earth
from which they came; the processes of nature are unceasingly
repeated; and, as Solomon said, there is nothing new
under the sun. Thomas therefore reaches the usual conclusion
that except for human free will and special manifestations
of divine will, all nature is placed by God under
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</span>
the rule of the stars. The influence of sun and moon is
manifest, and “why should we not with entire reason believe
the same of the other planets?”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Elements
and
spirits.</div>

<p>The nineteenth book opens with a discussion of the
universe and creation and closes with a discussion of the
four elements. Fire has eight effects expressed in the
couplet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Destruit, emollit, restringit, consolidatque;</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Clarificat, terret, accendit, letificatque.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Thomas illustrates each of these effects by a verse of Scripture.
Fire also has six properties, likewise expressed in a
couplet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Mobilis et siccus mundusque favilla tenetur;</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Crescit et accendit<a id="FNanchor_1309" href="#Footnote_1309" class="fnanchor">[1309]</a> sed aqua modica removetur.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Concerning these properties also Thomas quotes Scripture.
He then treats briefly of that purest fire which is above the
seven regions of the air. Demons dwell in the air “awaiting
with torments the judgment day.”<a id="FNanchor_1310" href="#Footnote_1310" class="fnanchor">[1310]</a> When they appear
to men, they assume bodies from that part of the air which
is densest and most mixed with the other three elements.
But angels coming as messengers to mankind assume bodies
in the region of pure fire extending from the sphere of the
moon to the firmament.</p>

master of theology, that Thomas of Cantimpré translated
word for word from Greek into Latin “all the books of
Aristotle in rational, natural, and moral philosophy and
metaphysics which we now use in the schools,<a id="FNanchor_1312" href="#Footnote_1312" class="fnanchor">[1312]</a> and this at
the instance of Saint Thomas of Aquinas, for in Albert’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</span>
time all commonly used the old translation.”<a id="FNanchor_1313" href="#Footnote_1313" class="fnanchor">[1313]</a> The task of
translating Aristotle was scarcely one for which Thomas
of Cantimpré was qualified, and his name almost never appears
in the extant manuscripts of translations of Aristotle.<a id="FNanchor_1314" href="#Footnote_1314" class="fnanchor">[1314]</a>
Peter of Prussia and his source have probably confused
William of Moerbeke with Thomas of Cantimpré, as they
both came from Brabant, and their names are juxtaposed in
a fourteenth century list of writings by Dominicans, where,
however, William is said to have “translated all the books of
natural and moral philosophy from Greek into Latin at the
instance of brother Thomas.”<a id="FNanchor_1315" href="#Footnote_1315" class="fnanchor">[1315]</a> Because of Thomas of
Cantimpré’s chapters on gynecology, the <i>De secretis
mulierum</i> usually ascribed to Albertus Magnus has sometimes
been attributed to him, but Ferckel denies this.<a id="FNanchor_1316" href="#Footnote_1316" class="fnanchor">[1316]</a></p>

<p><a id="Footnote_1254" href="#FNanchor_1254" class="label">[1254]</a> Only extracts of the <i>De natura
rerum</i> have been printed (by J. B.
Pitra, <i>Spicilegium Solesmense</i>,
III, and in HL and <i>Ferckel</i> as
noted below). Some discussion
of the MSS and a partial list of
them will be found in Appendix I
to this chapter. I have chiefly
used MSS Royal 12-E-XVII, 13th
century; Royal 12-F-VI, 14th century;
Egerton 1984, 13th century,
fols. 34-145; Arundel 323, 13th
century, fols. 1-98; and Arundel
164, 15th century, at the British
Museum; and BN 347B and 523A
at Paris. As any topic to which
a chapter is devoted can be found
without much difficulty in these
MSS, which are divided into books
and chapters and equipped with
tables of contents, I shall usually
not take the time and space to
make specific citations by folio
in the ensuing chapter.</p>

<p>Of Thomas’s <i>Bonum universale
de apibus</i> I have used the 1516
edition.</p>

Thomas and his natural science

“La Nature des Choses, par
Thomas de Cantimpré,” supplementing
and correcting the earlier
account by Daunou in HL 19
(1838) 177-84, where the <i>De natura
rerum</i> had been called an
anonymous work known only
from Vincent of Beauvais’ citation
of it.</p>

<p>A. Kaufmann, <i>Thomas von
Cantimpré</i>, Cologne, 1899, 137

science, which the author had

<p class="h3sub">THE MANUSCRIPTS OF THE DE NATURA RERUM</p>

<p>Of the half dozen or so MSS which I have examined Egerton
1984, 13th century, fols. 34-145, and Arundel 323, 13th century,
fols. 1-98, present a different version from the others, arranged in
a different order and somewhat more condensed, although sometimes
inserting points omitted in the other MSS, as has already
been illustrated in the text in the reproduction of the chapter on
the lion. These two MSS open with what is usually the 16th book
on the seven regions of the air and continue with the subjects of
the heavens and elements to which books 17-19 are usually devoted.
Then, omitting the themes of the usual first three books, they consider
quadrupeds (Egerton 1984, fol. 51v; Arundel 323, fol. 33r),
other animals, and herbs. Then follow precious stones and metals,
after instead of before which comes a truncated version of the
book on fountains (Egerton 1984, fol. 142v; Arundel 323, fol.
91r). Next comes a treatment of parts of the human body which
roughly answers to Thomas’s first book but omits entirely the
chapters dealing with generation and obstetrics. Indeed in Egerton
1984 the text breaks off at fol. 145v in the midst of the chapter
on teeth and in the middle of a word, and then ends on the upper
part of fol. 146r with the closing portion of the chapter <i>De anchis</i>
and the chapter on <i>Spondilia</i>. Arundel 323 continues as far as the
44th chapter on the spleen. It then at fol. 98r introduces a brief
discussion of geography (<i>Incipiunt Divisiones Provinciarum</i>), at
the close of which we read, “Explicit liber lucii annisii Senece
Cordubensis fortini stoyci discipuli De naturis rerum.” The text,
however, goes on to fol. 103v with a discussion of diseases, remedies,
and astrological medicine. Neither this nor the list of provinces
forms a part of the <i>De natura rerum</i> as contained in Royal
12-E-XVII and 12-F-VI.</p>

<p>As the <i>Histoire Littéraire de la France</i> listed only MSS of the
<i>De natura rerum</i> at Paris and in a few other continental libraries,
and as the authorship of Thomas of Cantimpré is seldom recognized
in the MSS catalogues, I append a list of MSS in British
and continental libraries which are not noted in the <i>Histoire Littéraire</i>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</span>
No doubt the list is still very incomplete. C. Ferckel
(1912), pp. 11-18 gives a fuller list than that in the <i>Histoire Littéraire</i>,
but only those MSS which are marked with an asterisk in
the following list have been noted by Ferckel:</p>

<p class="h3sub">SOME MANUSCRIPTS OF THE TREATISE OF THETEL ON SEALS</p>

<p>For the Berlin MS I follow the catalogue description by V.
Rose. I have examined personally the two Paris MSS and some
of those at Oxford.</p>

<p>Berlin 956, 12th century, fol. 22, what Rose calls the “very
peculiar original text.” “Hic incipit liber sigillorum filiorum
israel quem fecerunt in deserto. Cum pluribus libris nobilibus
magne auctoritatis et nominis vigilante animo atque perspicaci,
fratres karissimi, studeamus,” etc., which may be translated:
“Here begins the books of seals of the children of Israel which
they made in the desert. Although, dearest brothers, we have
studied many noble books of great authority and name with vigilant
and perspicacious mind, we have not found any book so dear
and precious as this is. For this is that great and secret precious
book of seals of Cehel the Israelite, which the children of Israel
made in the desert after their exodus from Egypt according to the
course and motion of the stars. And because many false books are
made in imitation of this, in order that we may perfectly know the
virtue of these seals we have noted them down in this little book.”</p>

<p>BN 8454, 12-13th century, fols. 65v-66r, Liber magnus et secretus
sigillorum Cehel. The <i>Incipit</i> and text closely resemble
Digby 79, except that the name is spelled “Cehel” and that no
mention is made of the planets.</p>

<p>BN 16204, 13th century, pp. 500-7. Has the same <i>Incipit</i> as
BN 8454 and Digby 79, except that the name is spelled “Theel” and
that the last clause of the <i>Incipit</i>, “et quia multi ... subnotavimus”
(for which see the description of Digby 79 below) is omitted.
On the other hand, we have the following opening paragraph of
text which is not found in BN 8454: “I, Theel, one of the sons
of the children of Israel, who after the transit of the Red Sea ate
manna in the wilderness and drank water from the rock and saw
innumerable miracles with my own eyes, and heard why from the
twelve tribes twelve precious stones are worn by order of the
Lord on Aaron’s vestments. And I myself chose them. And
besides this selection I have inspected the engraving of gems made,
as the divine Nature willed, according to the movement of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</span>
signs and the courses of the planets. And I have learned the
virtues of many. And I am called Theel (or rather, Cheel) for
this reason, because I have written of sealing (<i>de celatione</i>), that
is, concerning the sculpture of gems, and not because I have concealed
and kept to myself what God and nature have produced, for
I write to you, my posterity, in order that through these few brief
words many seals may be known in the nature of stones.”</p>

<p>This MS then has at pp. 500-2 the same text as BN 8454 except
that the names of the planets are inserted before the first seven
seals. At p. 502 the text as given in BN 8454 ends with the words,
“Hoc autem sigillum fertur habuisse galienus,” but the listing of
seals continues in BN 16204 until the top of p. 507, where the work
of Haly on elections begins.</p>

<p>Digby 79, 13th century, fols. 178v-180, opens, “In nomine Domini
nostri Jesu Christi. Hic est liber preciosus magnus atque
secretus sigillorum Eethel quem fecerunt filii Israel in deserto post
exitum ab Egipto secundum motus et cursus siderum, et quia multi
ad similitudinem huius falso facti sunt, in hoc libello subnotavimus.”
This version differs from that of Thomas of Cantimpré,
since its first seal is made under the planet Mercury and is an
image of a man seated on a plow. Then “under Mars” comes a
fuller description of what is the first seal in Thomas’s version.</p>

<p>Digby 193, 14th century, fol. 30, closely resembles Digby 79,
except that the name is spelled “Cethel.”</p>

<p>Ashmole 1471, late 14th century, fols. 65v-67v, closely resembles
Thomas of Cantimpré’s text. “Incipit liber Techel. Liber
Techel nomine editus de sculpturis lapidum a filiis Israel eo tempore
quo per desertum transierunt, et transierunt ut intrarent terram
promissionis: propterea hii lapides leguntur fuisse assignati
in templo Appollonis a rege Persarum cum consilio omnium astrologorum
tam Egiptiorum quam Caldeorum secundum cursum signorum
et cursum planetarum.” Next ensue the same preliminary
observations that Thomas makes; the text of Techel proper begins
only at fol. 66v.</p>

<p>Canon. Misc. 285, 15th century, fol. 40, anon., “In nomine dei
Amen; Pretiosissimus liber sigillorum quem filii Israel post
exitum....”</p>

<p>Corpus Christi 221, 14th century, fol. 55.</p>

<p>Selden 3464 (Bernard), #9.</p>

<p>CUL 1391, 14th century, fols. 204v-207v, “Liber magnus de
sigillis lapidum et de virtutibus eorum quem fecerunt Filii Israelis
in Deserto.” Like BN 8454 it closes, “hoc sigillum fertur habuisse
Gallienus.”</p>

his book.</div>

<p><i>On the Properties of Things</i> by Bartholomew of England<a id="FNanchor_1317" href="#Footnote_1317" class="fnanchor">[1317]</a>
is, as has been said in a previous chapter, a work of the
same sort as those on the natures of things by his earlier
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</span>
fellow-countryman, Alexander of Neckam, and his contemporary
of Brabant, Thomas of Cantimpré. Bartholomew
himself clearly states the character, purpose, and scope of
his work both at its beginning and again in closing. It is
primarily a brief compilation of passages on the natures
and properties of things, which are scattered through the
works both of the saints and the philosophers, with the intent
of making plainer the enigmas which the Holy Scriptures
conceal under the symbols and figures of the properties
of natural and artificial objects. Bartholomew further
speaks modestly of his work as an elementary treatise, text-book,
or work of reference for the benefit of “young scholars
and the general reader (<i>simplices et parvuli</i>) who because
of the infinite number of books cannot look up the properties
of the objects of which Scripture treats, nor are they able
to find quickly even a superficial treatment of what they are
after.”<a id="FNanchor_1318" href="#Footnote_1318" class="fnanchor">[1318]</a> Bartholomew’s book is therefore “a simple and
rude” compilation, but he hopes that it may prove useful
to persons who, like himself, are not advanced scholars. But
after mastering this elementary treatise, they should proceed
to more subtle and specialized works. And if they
think that anything should be added to what he has given,
let them add it. From the tone of these remarks compared
to those of Thomas of Cantimpré one would infer that
the number of available books and also the amount of available
knowledge had considerably increased since Thomas
wrote. Yet at the most Bartholomew cannot have written
very many years later than Thomas, and it is most likely
that their books appeared almost simultaneously.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Question
of its date.</div>

<p>If Bartholomew’s last sentence is interpreted as an open
invitation to his readers to issue revised editions of the
book or at least add to their own copies further extracts
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</span>
from the writings of the saints and the philosophers, we
shall feel that it is rather risky to attempt to determine the
date of the first appearance of the <i>De proprietatibus rerum</i>
from the date of the latest works cited in our present copies.
But all the manuscripts seem to be essentially alike regardless
of date, and the printed edition seems to vary little from
the text of the earliest manuscripts. To assist us in determining
when Bartholomew lived and wrote we have a request
from the General of the Franciscan Order in 1230
asking the French provincial to send to Magdeburg in
Saxony Brother Bartholomaeus Anglicus to act as lecturer
there.<a id="FNanchor_1319" href="#Footnote_1319" class="fnanchor">[1319]</a> Salimbene, writing in 1284, cites a passage from
Bartholomew concerning elephants and looks back upon him
as a great clerk who lectured on the whole Bible in course
at Paris.<a id="FNanchor_1320" href="#Footnote_1320" class="fnanchor">[1320]</a> Bartholomew speaks of the inhabitants of
Livonia as having been forced by the Germans from the
cult of demons to the Faith of one God, and states that by
divine grace and the cooperation of the Germans they are
now believed to be freed from their former errors.<a id="FNanchor_1321" href="#Footnote_1321" class="fnanchor">[1321]</a> But
since the conquest of Livonia began as early as 1202, this
passage does not serve to date Bartholomew’s work very
definitely.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Who are
the most
recent
authors
cited in it?</div>

<p>It has already been remarked by the <i>Histoire Littéraire
de la France</i> that in the bibliography at the close of his
work Bartholomew mentions no writer of later date than
the early thirteenth century.<a id="FNanchor_1322" href="#Footnote_1322" class="fnanchor">[1322]</a> As Bartholomew himself
states, however, he uses “many other” authorities than those
given in the list, and other names are found sprinkled
through his text. In the printed edition of 1488 the <i>Speculum
naturale</i> of Vincent of Beauvais, which was not written
until 1250, is cited,<a id="FNanchor_1323" href="#Footnote_1323" class="fnanchor">[1323]</a> but this mention is found in the last
sentence of a chapter and may be pretty certainly regarded
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</span>
as a later interpolation.<a id="FNanchor_1324" href="#Footnote_1324" class="fnanchor">[1324]</a> In citing commentaries upon the
works of Aristotle the printed text confuses the abbreviations
<i>Albu.</i>, <i>Alber.</i>, and <i>Alfre.</i> or <i>Alur.</i>, standing respectively
for Albumasar, Albertus Magnus, and Aluredus or Alfred
of England who alone is listed in Bartholomew’s bibliography.
There seems to be no certain citation of Albert.
If Bartholomew had read Albert’s sharp criticism of Jorath,
he perhaps would not have made use of that author. The
bibliography includes the names of Michael Scot who was
dead by 1235 and of Robert of Lincoln, by whom Grosseteste
must be meant, who was born about 1175, became bishop of
Lincoln in 1235, and died in 1253. A Gilbertus mentioned
in the bibliography may be either the medical writer, Gilbert
of England, whose own date is somewhat uncertain, or a
corruption for Gerbert. These three writers are seldom, if
ever, cited by name in the text of Bartholomew. But he
does cite Alexander of Hales<a id="FNanchor_1325" href="#Footnote_1325" class="fnanchor">[1325]</a> who died in 1245. On the
whole it seems possible that Bartholomew wrote his work
as early as 1230.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How far
are its
citations
first-hand?</div>

<p>The <i>Histoire Littéraire</i> asserts that “Bartholomew surely
was not acquainted with all the authors, true or supposititious,
whom he is pleased to enumerate,” but it gives no
grounds except the list itself for this sceptical attitude. It
is true that in the case of a few authorities in his list, such
as Scipio Africanus, Ninus Delphicus, and Epicurus, it
would have been as difficult to find any works by them then
as now. But I believe that Bartholomew was a wide reader
and acquainted with the greater part of the books and
authors that he cites. Modern writers concerning medieval
learning have too often proceeded upon the gratuitous assumption
that medieval writers seldom were directly acquainted
with the authorities which they cite. But one suspects
that those who have assumed this were none too well
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</span>
acquainted themselves either with the works citing or cited.
And why should medieval scholars take their citations at
second hand? The original works were fairly accessible;
the earliest manuscripts we have of them are almost invariably
medieval, and probably they had many, many more
copies that are now destroyed, and possibly some originals
that are now forever lost. As for Bartholomew, his citations
are so numerous, so varied, so specific that they must
be largely first-hand.<a id="FNanchor_1326" href="#Footnote_1326" class="fnanchor">[1326]</a> Obviously he did not spare himself
trouble in making a book to save others trouble. Bartholomew
also seems to be scrupulously honest in his citations.
For instance, Pythagoras is cited but once in the <i>Etymologies</i>
of Isidore,<a id="FNanchor_1327" href="#Footnote_1327" class="fnanchor">[1327]</a> and when Bartholomew makes use of this
passage, he gives both Pythagoras and Isidore credit.<a id="FNanchor_1328" href="#Footnote_1328" class="fnanchor">[1328]</a> It is
therefore only fair to Bartholomew to admit that, had his
citation of Pythagoras in <i>The Book of the Romans</i> been
drawn from any third author, he would have given him
credit too. Bartholomew cites Pliny’s <i>Natural History</i> by
book and chapter and is evidently directly acquainted with
it. On the whole, I am inclined to think that medieval
writers had read quite as much of the works listed in their
bibliographies as modern writers have of those listed in
<i>theirs</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its
medieval
currency.</div>

<p>In the Bibliothèque Nationale at Paris alone there are
eighteen manuscripts of the <i>De proprietatibus rerum</i>, chiefly
of the late thirteenth and early fourteenth century, and the
<i>Histoire Littéraire</i> tells us that its title appears in a catalogue
of the books which the medieval booksellers of Paris
rented to the students at that university.<a id="FNanchor_1329" href="#Footnote_1329" class="fnanchor">[1329]</a> The work also
occurs with frequency in the manuscript collections of England,
Germany, and Italy. Hain’s list of fourteen printed
editions of it before 1500 is incomplete, and the British
Museum catalogue of books printed in Germany alone in
the fifteenth century mentions nine editions. It was translated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</span>
into French under Charles V in the fourteenth century,
and also appeared in English, Spanish, and Dutch versions,
all three of which were printed at the end of the fifteenth
century. These facts indicate that the work was, and continued
until the sixteenth century to be, widely used as a
text-book, and suggest the further thought that such widely
multiplied and disseminated elementary and popular works
are more likely to have survived the stagnant and destructive
period of the Black Death and Hundred Years War and
to have come down to us than are the more advanced, original,
and elaborate works of the thirteenth century. Be that
as it may, we must not look upon the <i>De proprietatibus rerum</i>
as a specimen of the most advanced medieval scholarship,
but rather as an illustration of the rough general knowledge
which every person with any pretense to culture was then
supposed to possess. At the same time, the large number
of authorities cited shows how much wider reading a medieval
student might do.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Not a
mere compilation
nor
limited to
Biblical
topics.</div>

<p>On the other hand, we must not be misled by Bartholomew’s
humble tone of self-depreciation nor even by his assertion,
repeated at the close as well as the opening of his
work, that he presents “little or nothing of my own, but
simply the words of the saints and the sayings of the philosophers.”
As a matter of fact, he not infrequently alludes to
contemporary matters or describes daily life without mentioning
any authorities, and his amusing accounts of such
animals as cats and dogs, or boys and girls, or his instructions
how to set a table and give a dinner, are almost entirely
his own and show considerable power of observation and
dry humor. His chapters on geography, too, deal in large
measure and with unusual fulness with the feudal states
and peoples of his own day: Scotland, Ireland, Flanders,
Brabant, Anjou, Poitou, and so on through a long list alphabetically
arranged. In these and in other chapters he forgets
all about the fact that he is supposedly explaining only those
things mentioned in the Bible, and is manifestly actuated by
a scientific interest in present facts and phenomena. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</span>
influence of Isidore’s <i>Etymologies</i> upon Bartholomew’s book
is evident, and Bartholomew often makes Isidore his starting
point in discussing a given topic. But he also often goes
far beyond the other’s brief statements; it seems clear that
the scanty contents of the <i>Etymologies</i> are no longer deemed
sufficient even in an elementary encylopedia and general
text-book. Bartholomew seems to use the scissors less than
Thomas of Cantimpré, to state things more in his own
words, and not to make such long extracts from or paraphrases
of other works.</p>

<p>However, in Bartholomew’s first book, whose subject is
God, the first two chapters are taken entirely and perhaps
discreetly, since the difficult problem of the Trinity is under
discussion, from an <i>Extra</i> of Innocent III, while the third
chapter is drawn from more varied authorities, such as
Augustine, the treatise on the Trinity ascribed to Boethius,<a id="FNanchor_1330" href="#Footnote_1330" class="fnanchor">[1330]</a>
and the more recent Hugh and Richard, both of St. Victor.
Presently the theme of divine names is discussed<a id="FNanchor_1331" href="#Footnote_1331" class="fnanchor">[1331]</a> and
Bartholomew lists and explains the ten Hebrew names of
God, which are found also in Isidore, namely: El, Eloe,
Sabbaoth, Zelioz or Ramathel, Eyel, Adonay, Ya, Tetragrammaton,
Saday, and Eloym.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
nature of
demons.</div>

<p>In the second book on the properties of angels is also
discussed the nature of demons.<a id="FNanchor_1332" href="#Footnote_1332" class="fnanchor">[1332]</a> They are naturally perspicacious
in matters of science and powerful by their “sense
of nature”&mdash;a phrase which we have already met in William
of Auvergne, whom, however, I think Bartholomew does
not cite; perhaps it was a technical expression that spread
rapidly from mouth to mouth of medieval psychologists as
such expressions do today,&mdash;experience of time, and knowledge
of Scripture. They can predict many future events,
partly because their knowledge of nature gained through
their subtler senses is superior to man’s, partly because of
their longer lives which permit them to learn more, partly
by angelic revelation. Their bodies were celestial before
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</span>
they transgressed but now are aerial. Apuleius’s characterization
of them is repeated <i>via</i> Augustine, whose explanation
is also given, that they know occult virtues in nature which
are hidden from us and by which they are able to accelerate
natural processes and work feats of magic such as those
performed by Pharaoh’s magicians.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Psychology
and physiology.</div>

<p>Bartholomew’s third book may be described as psychological
and discusses the human mind or soul (<i>anima</i>), of
which definitions by various Greek philosophers are repeated,
and the senses. The fourth and fifth books are physiological.
These three books seem to be based mainly upon the writings
of Constantinus Africanus; less frequently Aristotle and
other authorities are cited. One treatise is ascribed to
Avicenna and Constantinus which is not in Peter the
Deacon’s list of the latter’s works, namely, a treatise on
poisonous animals and poisons and presumably a translation
of Avicenna by Constantinus.<a id="FNanchor_1333" href="#Footnote_1333" class="fnanchor">[1333]</a> In this connection we
are told that while some animals have poisonous tongues like
snakes, others have medicinal and healing tongues like the
dog, as Cassiodorus says, and either from the goodness of
nature or from some occult property.<a id="FNanchor_1334" href="#Footnote_1334" class="fnanchor">[1334]</a> We have already
noted elsewhere Bartholomew’s acceptance of the usual
medieval theory of three brain cells devoted to three mental
faculties, in which connection he cites Johannitius or Hunain
ibn Ishak.<a id="FNanchor_1335" href="#Footnote_1335" class="fnanchor">[1335]</a> In discussing the disease of <i>melancholia</i>
Bartholomew tells of a noble whom he knew who imagined
that he was a cat and insisted upon sleeping under the bed
in order to watch the mouse holes.<a id="FNanchor_1336" href="#Footnote_1336" class="fnanchor">[1336]</a> In a later passage in
his seventh book Bartholomew repeats Constantinus’ distinction
between mania as an infection of the anterior cell of
the brain with injury to the imagination and melancholia
as an infection of the central cell with loss of one’s reason.<a id="FNanchor_1337" href="#Footnote_1337" class="fnanchor">[1337]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</span></p><div class="sidenote">Vision
and perspective.</div>

<p>In discussing vision Bartholomew gives the views of
“an author of the science of perspective” precedence over
those of Constantinus.<a id="FNanchor_1338" href="#Footnote_1338" class="fnanchor">[1338]</a> This author believes that in vision
three coterminous pyramids or cones are formed with the
apex of each in the pupil of the eye and the base formed
by the object seen. One pyramid is made up of <i>species</i> from
the object coming along straight lines to the center of the
eye. The second pyramid is made by the vision going out
from the eye to the object seen. The third pyramid consists
of light, which, as Bartholomew explains elsewhere<a id="FNanchor_1339" href="#Footnote_1339" class="fnanchor">[1339]</a>
on the authority of Basel and Dionysius and Augustine, is
a distinct substance by which other bodies are illuminated.
Light was created three days before sun and moon which
are simply vehicles for it. But while this light is always
shining, whether visibly or invisibly, it produces illumination
only when other bodies are in a condition to receive it. The
human eye can see itself only by the reflection of rays, “and
possibly the vision delights in the sight of a mirror because
through reflection of rays it is, by returning to itself,
fortified as it were and in a way strengthened.”<a id="FNanchor_1340" href="#Footnote_1340" class="fnanchor">[1340]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Medieval
domestic
science.</div>

<p>Bartholomew’s sixth book is entitled, “Of ages,” but
really deals more with matters of daily family and domestic
life, discussing in addition to age, death, infancy, childhood,
manhood, such family relationships as father, mother, and
daughter, and such domestic concerns as servants, food and
drink, dinners and banquets, sleep and waking, dreams and
exercise. This last topic of exercise is discussed largely in
the words of a sermon by Fulgentius, but in other chapters
Bartholomew writes so vividly from his own observation
that he deserves quotation, although the themes are somewhat
of a digression from our main subject.<a id="FNanchor_1341" href="#Footnote_1341" class="fnanchor">[1341]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</span></p>
<div class="sidenote">The
medieval
domestic
servant.</div>

<p>“The handmaid is a female slave deputed to make herself
useful to the housewife. She is assigned to the more laborious
and demeaning tasks, she is fed with coarser food, she
is clad in meaner clothing, she is oppressed by the yoke of
servitude.” Her son becomes a serf and, if she is of servile
condition, so does a freeman who marries her, nor is she
permitted to marry as she chooses. “Like the serf, she is
because of the vice of ingratitude recalled after being manumitted,
is afflicted with scoldings, is bruised by rods and
beatings, is oppressed by varied and conflicting vexations
and anxieties, is scarcely permitted to breathe amid her
miseries.” Such painting of her woes does not imply much
sympathy on Bartholomew’s part, however, since he concludes
by saying that it is written that whoso nourishes his
servant delicately will find him insolent in the end.<a id="FNanchor_1342" href="#Footnote_1342" class="fnanchor">[1342]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Medieval
boys.</div>

<p>Boys have a great capacity for mischief but are susceptible
to discipline, if put under tutors and compelled to
submit to it. Their constitutions are hot and moist, their
flesh is soft, their bodies are flexible, agile, and light; their
minds are docile. They lead a safe life without care and
worry, appreciating only play, fearing no danger more than
the rod, loving apples better than gold. They go naked unashamed;
they are heedless of praise or scolding, easily
angered and easily placated, easily hurt in the body and
unable to endure much work. The hot humor that dominates
them makes them restless and fickle. They tend to
eat too much and are susceptible to various diseases in
consequence. They think only of the present and care
nothing for the future; they love games and vanities but
refuse to attend to gain and utility. “The least things they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</span>
think the greatest, and vice versa.” “They want what is
hurtful and contrary to them.” They do not remember
favors received. All that they see they desire and imitate.
They prefer to talk with and take advice from other boys,
and shun the company of their elders. They can’t keep
secrets. They laugh or cry easily, and they are continually
shouting, talking, or chattering, and can scarcely keep still
even while they are asleep.<a id="FNanchor_1343" href="#Footnote_1343" class="fnanchor">[1343]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Medieval
girls.</div>

<p>Girls “are in constitution hot, moist, and of delicate
health; in physique graceful and flexible and beautiful; in
mental attitude modest and timid and playful; in their social
relations well trained in manners, cautious and reticent in
speech, luxurious in dress.” After quoting Aristotle to the
effect that women generally have longer and softer hair than
men and a longer neck, and remarking the peculiarities of
their complexions and figures, Bartholomew says further
that they have slenderer and more flexible hands and feet, a
weaker voice, voluble and ready speech, that they take short
steps, and that in mind they tend to be haughty, are prone
to wrath, tenacious in hate, merciful, jealous, impatient of
labor, docile, tricky, bitter, and “headlong in lust.”<a id="FNanchor_1344" href="#Footnote_1344" class="fnanchor">[1344]</a>
Whether Bartholomew is inconsistent in this passage or believes
that the female nature is, the reader must judge.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A medieval
dinner.</div>

<p>These are Bartholomew’s instructions for giving a dinner
party: “First the food is prepared; at the same time the
guests are assembled; chairs and also stools are required; in
the dining room tables are set and the table furnishings are
arranged and adorned. The guests with the host are placed
at the head table, but they do not sit down at table before
the hands of the guests are washed; next the host’s children
and then the servants are grouped together at table. Spoons,
knives, and salt cellars are first placed upon the table. Loaves
of bread and cups of wine are presently added. There follow
many and varied courses; the butlers and waiters serve
each person diligently. The guests joyfully engage in vying
with one another in pledging toasts; they are cheered with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</span>
viols and citharas; now the wines and now the courses are
renewed; they divide and share with one another the dishes
which happen to be opposite them; finally the fruit and
dessert are brought in. When dinner is finished, the table
furnishings and remains of food are carried away and the
tables are set aside. Hands are again washed and wiped;
thanks are returned to God and to the host; for the sake of
good cheer the cups go round again and again. When these
features of the dinner are over, the guests either are offered
couches for some rest, or are allowed to return home.”<a id="FNanchor_1345" href="#Footnote_1345" class="fnanchor">[1345]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Dreams
and their
interpretation.</div>

<p>In a chapter on dreams Bartholomew declares that they
are sometimes true and sometimes false. One should neither
put indiscriminate faith in them nor spurn them entirely,
since sometimes certain conjectures concerning the future
may be had through dreams. Moreover, the meaning of
some dreams is evident at once; others require interpretation.
Dreams arise from varied sources, being produced
by divine inspiration, by angelic administration, by diabolic
illusion, or by natural and bodily causes.<a id="FNanchor_1346" href="#Footnote_1346" class="fnanchor">[1346]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Medical
advice.</div>

<p>Bartholomew’s seventh book is medical, treating of infirmities
in seventy chapters. His desire to be brief is probably
what restrains him from including any long medical
concoctions. He continues to make much use of Constantinus
Africanus, who is cited in almost every chapter, and
whose “many other experiments”<a id="FNanchor_1347" href="#Footnote_1347" class="fnanchor">[1347]</a> Bartholomew often has
not time to include. One of the cures cited from Constantinus
is to scarify the shin bones in order to cure a
headache, the theory being that this will remove the injurious
humor from the head to the lower extremities.<a id="FNanchor_1348" href="#Footnote_1348" class="fnanchor">[1348]</a> A
part of the treatment prescribed for cases of frenzy is to
shave the scalp and wash it with tepid vinegar or cover
it with plasters made of the lung of a pig or cow. Keeping
the patient firmly bound in a dark place, bleeding him, and
abstaining from answering his foolish questions are other
features of the regimen suggested.<a id="FNanchor_1349" href="#Footnote_1349" class="fnanchor">[1349]</a> To rouse a patient
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</span>
from a state of stupor and lethargy it is recommended to
pull hard at his hair or beard, dash cold water frequently
in his face, or make a stench under him.<a id="FNanchor_1350" href="#Footnote_1350" class="fnanchor">[1350]</a> An “experiment”
against epilepsy from Platearius consists in scarifying three
drops of blood from the patient’s scalp and at the end of
the fit giving them to him to eat with a crow’s egg.<a id="FNanchor_1351" href="#Footnote_1351" class="fnanchor">[1351]</a> Indeed
crow’s eggs alone are regarded as quite beneficial. To
Platearius is also credited the following method “of curing
or at least palliating leprosy.”<a id="FNanchor_1352" href="#Footnote_1352" class="fnanchor">[1352]</a> Take a red snake with a
white belly, remove the venom, cut off the head and tail,
cook it with leeks, and administer it frequently with food,&mdash;a
preparation roughly similar to theriac. Wine in which a
snake has lain putrefying a long time is “a medicine useful
for many diseases,” and Bartholomew repeats the tale we
have heard before of the woman who caused her blind husband
to recover his sight instead of killing him when she
cooked a snake instead of an eel with garlic for him to eat.
After such liberties had been taken with his blindness, one
would expect a husband to recover his sight, if he could!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Poisons.</div>

<p>The poisons of venomous animals differ. The venom
of the viper is hot and dry; that of the scorpion, cold and
dry; that of the spider, cold and moist. Avicenna says that
the poison of the male is really more deadly than that of
the female, but female serpents have more teeth and so
are perhaps worse on the whole. The venom of the old
is more injurious than that of the young; that of a fasting
animal is more harmful than that of a full animal; and
poisons are worse in summer than winter, and at noon than
at night.<a id="FNanchor_1353" href="#Footnote_1353" class="fnanchor">[1353]</a> “Diascorides” says<a id="FNanchor_1354" href="#Footnote_1354" class="fnanchor">[1354]</a> that river crabs possess an
occult virtue against the bite of mad dogs, and their ashes
taken with gentian are a singular remedy. A scorpion sting
may be cured by placing oil in which the scorpion has been
drowned or boiled upon the puncture, or by pulverizing the
scorpion’s body and placing it upon the wound. The idea
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</span>
of course is that the poison will return to the body from
which it came.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
waters
above the
firmament.</div>

<p>In book eight Bartholomew discusses the universe and
celestial bodies. According to the tradition of the saints
there is a visible and an invisible heaven. The visible heaven
is multiplex and subdivides into seven heavens, the aerial,
ethereal, fiery, Olympian, the firmament, the aqueous or
crystalline, and the empyrean. The authority of Scripture
concerning the waters above the firmament causes Bartholomew
to accept the existence of an aqueous or crystalline
heaven. But he rejects Bede’s view that these waters are
cold and congealed in order to temper the excessive heat
generated by the swift revolution of the other heavens, for
Job tells us that there is concord and harmony in the heavens,
and cold and humid waters would be contrary to the celestial
substance of the heavens. Therefore “the moderns” have
in Bartholomew’s opinion “investigated the inmost secrets
of philosophy more profoundly,” when, as Alexander of
Hales states, they suggest that those waters are neither
frigid, fluid, and humid, nor congealed, solid, and ponderous,
but on the contrary very mobile and remarkable for their
clearness and transparency. It is not because they are congealed
but because they are transparent that this heaven is
called crystalline.<a id="FNanchor_1355" href="#Footnote_1355" class="fnanchor">[1355]</a> In other words, the “waters above the
firmament” are not really waters. And the original modern
investigator who ventured to dispute Bede’s authority on the
subject of the waters above the firmament was not Alexander
of Hales but, as we have seen, William of Conches,
whom Bartholomew lists in his bibliography and quotes in
other passages, although he does not mention him by name
here.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
The
empyrean
heaven:
Rabanus.</div>

<p>Of the other heavens Bartholomew gives most space
to the empyrean. It is by nature immobile and unmoved
and consequently is not essential like the other heavens for
the continued generation of things in our inferior world,
but rather, as Alexander of Hales says, to round out the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</span>
universe and the types of bodies in it. Bartholomew continues:
“The empyrean heaven is the first body, simplest in
nature, the least corporeal, the subtlest, the first firmament
of the world, largest in quantity, lucid in quality, spherical
in shape, loftiest in location since farthest from the center,
embracing in its amplitude spirits and bodies visible and invisible,
and the abode of the supreme God; for God may be
everywhere, yet he is said especially to be in the heaven, since
there shines most powerfully the working of his virtue.”<a id="FNanchor_1356" href="#Footnote_1356" class="fnanchor">[1356]</a>
After this description of the last of the visible heavens as
the abode of invisible spirits and of God Himself there does
not seem to be much call for an invisible heaven, which
Bartholomew himself seems by this time to have forgotten.
For the passage just quoted he cites Rabanus as his source
“who employs the words of Basil in the <i>Hexaemeron</i>,”
but I have been unable to find the passage either in the
<i>Hexaemeron</i> of Basil or the works of Rabanus Maurus.<a id="FNanchor_1357" href="#Footnote_1357" class="fnanchor">[1357]</a>
Nor have I been able to find several other citations which
Bartholomew makes from Rabanus in matters astronomical
and astrological.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Alexander
of Hales.</div>

<p>A word may be introduced concerning Alexander of
Hales, whom Bartholomew has twice cited in the foregoing
passages, but whom we probably shall not have occasion
to mention again. Like Bartholomew, he was an Englishman
and a Franciscan, and Bartholomew may have been
either an attendant upon his lectures or his colleague at
Paris. He died in 1245 and is known as one of the first
to attempt to fit together previous Christian opinion and
theology with the newly introduced works of Aristotle and
writings of the Arabs. Of this we see evidence in the
citations made from him by Bartholomew. But Alexander’s
field was primarily theology and not natural science.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Aristotelian
theory
of one
heaven.</div>

<p>While the saints may regard the heavens as manifold
and list as many as seven of them,<a id="FNanchor_1358" href="#Footnote_1358" class="fnanchor">[1358]</a> the philosophers will
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</span>
admit only one heaven, says Bartholomew, who this time
correctly quotes Basil as affirming in the <i>Hexaemeron</i> that
“the philosophers would rather gnaw out their tongues than
admit that there are many heavens.” Bartholomew also
presents Aristotle’s view in the <i>Liber de celo et mundo</i> that
the heaven is characterized by the greatest possible simplicity
and purity and has no division or contrariety of
parts. According to the new translation of <i>De celo et
mundo</i> it is “a perfect complete unit to which there is no
like, neither fabricated nor generated,” and with an equal,
single, and circular motion. In the <i>De causis elementorum</i>
Aristotle holds further that the heaven is a fifth element,
differing in natural properties and distinct from the four
elements and not like them subject to generation and corruption.<a id="FNanchor_1359" href="#Footnote_1359" class="fnanchor">[1359]</a>
Indeed, they would destroy one another by their
mutual contrariety and repugnance were it not for the
conciliating influence of celestial virtue.<a id="FNanchor_1360" href="#Footnote_1360" class="fnanchor">[1360]</a> But while the
heaven is one, it has many orbs and circles of varying figure
and magnitude, and there is a greater aggregation of light
in the stars than in other parts of the sky. Such variations
account for the varying or even contrary effects produced
by the heaven in our lower world at different times and
places, and explain why the pure sky causes corruption as
well as generation here below.</p>

<div class="sidenote">As the
basis of
astrology.</div>

<p>The Aristotelian foundation thus laid for the superstructure
of astrological science and art is apparently accepted
by Bartholomew, who states that “the Creator
established the heaven as the cause and origin of generation
and corruption, and therefore it was necessary that it should
not be subject to generation and corruption.” In short, the
universe divides into two parts. The heaven, beginning
with the circle of the moon, is the nobler, simpler, superior,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</span>
and active portion of the universe. The other part, extending
from the sphere of the moon downward to earth’s
center, is inferior, passive, acted upon and governed by
the heaven. In all his later scientific and astrological discussion
Bartholomew implies this hypothesis, and, after the
two chapters which we have already summarized on the
waters above the firmament and the empyrean heaven, pays
no more attention to the seven heavens of the saints. The
firmament, “called by the philosophers the first heaven and
the last, in whose convexity are situated the bodies of stars
and planets,” absorbs his attention during the remaining
forty-eight chapters of his eighth book. “By means of its
motion, it is the effective principle of generation and corruption
in the inferior world.” Rabanus explains how its
rays converge as toward a center upon the earth’s surface
and exert a concentrated impression there; and the science
of perspective also illustrates this. The three less stable
elements, air, fire, and water, obey the firmament even to
the extent of local motion, as is illustrated by the tides. The
element earth is not influenced in this way, but produces
diverse species from itself in obedience to the celestial impressions
which it receives.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Properties
and effects
of the
signs and
planets.</div>

<p>Bartholomew discusses the signs of the zodiac in much
the usual astrological fashion. They are given animal names
because in their effects they represent the properties of those
animals.<a id="FNanchor_1361" href="#Footnote_1361" class="fnanchor">[1361]</a> In their effects, too, they may be distinguished
as hot or cold, masculine or feminine, diurnal or nocturnal;
and they are grouped in trios with the four elements and
cardinal points and in varied relations with the planets.
Each governs its portion of the human body; thus the Ram
“dominates the head and face, and produces a hairy body, a
crooked frame, an oblique face, heavy eyes, short ears, a
long neck.”<a id="FNanchor_1362" href="#Footnote_1362" class="fnanchor">[1362]</a> Each sign also has its bearings on human
life; thus Virgo is “the house of sickness, of serfs and
handmaids and the domestic animals. It signifies inconstancy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</span>
and changing from place to place.”<a id="FNanchor_1363" href="#Footnote_1363" class="fnanchor">[1363]</a> Bartholomew
indeed devotes a separate chapter to “the properties and
occult virtues” of each sign “according to the astrologers.”<a id="FNanchor_1364" href="#Footnote_1364" class="fnanchor">[1364]</a>
The seven planets by their progress through the signs and
conjunctions in them influence every creature on earth.<a id="FNanchor_1365" href="#Footnote_1365" class="fnanchor">[1365]</a>
Bartholomew outlines their successive control of the formation
of the child in the womb. He also devotes a chapter
to the influence of each planet. Mars, for example, “disposes
men to mobility and levity of mind, to wrath and animosity
and other choleric passions; it also fits men for arts
employing fire such as those of smiths and bakers, just as
Saturn produces agriculturists and porters of heavy weights,
and Jupiter on the contrary turns out men adapted to lighter
pursuits such as orators and money-changers.”<a id="FNanchor_1366" href="#Footnote_1366" class="fnanchor">[1366]</a> Bartholomew
also discusses the head and tail of the dragon as “two
stars which are not planets but yet seem to have the nature
and influence of the planets.”<a id="FNanchor_1367" href="#Footnote_1367" class="fnanchor">[1367]</a> The fixed stars, too, have
their influence, causing storms or clear weather and, according
to the <i>mathematici</i>, presignifying sad or glad events.
Bartholomew further sets forth the theory of the <i>magnus
annus</i> or return of all the stars to the same positions after
an interval of 15,000 or 36,000 years. “But whatever the
philosophers have said concerning it, this much is sure that
it is not for us to determine the last day.”<a id="FNanchor_1368" href="#Footnote_1368" class="fnanchor">[1368]</a> God alone
knows. Bartholomew’s most frequently cited authorities on
the subject of astrology seem to be Albumasar, Messahala<a id="FNanchor_1369" href="#Footnote_1369" class="fnanchor">[1369]</a>
(Ma Sha’ Allah), and Alphraganus.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bartholomew

the

<p>Thus Bartholomew, a Franciscan in good standing,
who lectured on the Bible at Paris and was called by the
General of his Order to lecture in Saxony, in a work intended
for elementary students and the general reader, far
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</span>
from engaging in any tilt with the astrologers or attacking
their art as involving fatalism and contrary to morality
and free will, affirms the general law of the control of earth
by sky and repeats with little or no question a mass of
astrological detail from Arabian writers. After such an
exhibition as this of what a commonplace and matter-of-course
affair astrological theory was in the thirteenth century,
how impossible it is to have the least sympathy with
those specialists in medieval learning who would have the
work of Daniel of Morley shunned like the pest because
of its astrological doctrine, or account for Bacon’s imprisonment
in 1278 by his astrological doctrine, or deny that
Albertus Magnus could have written the <i>Speculum astronomiae</i>
with its astrological doctrine. But of Bacon and
Albertus more later.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Medieval
divisions
of the day
and hour.</div>

<p>Bartholomew’s ninth book deals with time and its parts.
He defines a day as the time occupied by a complete revolution
of the sun around the earth, and states that a day consists
of twenty-four hours, or of four “quarters” of six
hours each. But he seems unacquainted with our division
of the hour into sixty minutes and the minute into sixty
seconds. Instead he subdivides the hour into four “points”
or forty “moments.” Each moment is thus equivalent to
a minute and a half of our time, and it may be divided
further into twelve <i>unciae</i> (ounces), while each <i>uncia</i> includes
forty-seven atoms, making 22,560 atoms in an hour
as against 3,600 of our seconds. Honorius of Autun in his
<i>De imagine mundi</i>, a work written presumably in the first
part of the twelfth century, speaks of the hour as a twelfth
part of the day, but makes it consist of four “points,” forty
“moments,” and 22,560 atoms just as Bartholomew does.
But Honorius also divides the hour into ten “minutes,”
fifteen “parts,” and sixty <i>ostenta</i>, which last would correspond
to our minutes, if his hour was of the same length
as ours. Honorius does not mention the <i>unciae</i> of Bartholomew.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</span><a id="FNanchor_1370" href="#Footnote_1370" class="fnanchor">[1370]</a>
Bartholomew further tells us that Sunday is called
the Lord’s Day and is privileged in many particulars, since
on it the world was created, the Lord was born, rose from
the dead, and also sent the Holy Spirit. We have already
presented Bartholomew’s discussion of the Egyptian days in
an earlier chapter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Form and
matter:
fire and
coal.</div>

<p>The tenth book, in nine brief chapters, is entitled, “Form
and Matter,” but after one chapter on form, discusses the
elements. An element, according to Constantinus, is a simple
substance and the least particle of a compound body.
The rest of the chapters are devoted to the particular element
fire and to things closely associated with it, such as flame,
smoke, sparks, and ashes. <i>Carbo</i>, “Rabanus says, is fire
actually incorporated and united with earthly matter.” Bartholomew’s
further description suggests our coal, but perhaps
he has only charcoal in mind.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Air and its
creatures.</div>

<p>The eleventh book treats in sixteen chapters of the element
air and its “passions,” such as winds, clouds, rainbows,
dew, rain, hail, snow, thunder and lightning, and leads
up to the following book on birds, or rather, creatures of
the air, since bees, flies, crickets, locusts, bats, and griffins
are included in the alphabetical list of thirty-eight chapters.
The birds described are for the most part familiar ones: the
eagle, hawk, owl, dove, turtle-dove, quail, stork, crow, crane,
hen, swallow, kite, partridge, peacock, pelican, screech-owl,
sparrow, vulture, hoopoe, phoenix. Some of these creatures
place precious stones in their nests to keep off snakes,
the eagle employing the gem achates<a id="FNanchor_1371" href="#Footnote_1371" class="fnanchor">[1371]</a> and the griffin an
emerald.<a id="FNanchor_1372" href="#Footnote_1372" class="fnanchor">[1372]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
swallow,
swallow-stone,
and
swallow-wort.</div>

<p>Swallows have gems called <i>celidonii</i> in their gizzards,
one white and one red. The red variety is called masculine
because it is of greater virtue than the white kind. These
stones are especially valuable if they have been extracted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</span>
from the chick before it touches the ground, “as is said in
<i>Lapidarius</i> where their virtues are described as Constantinus
says.”<a id="FNanchor_1373" href="#Footnote_1373" class="fnanchor">[1373]</a> <i>Lapidarius</i> can scarcely mean Marbod’s poem on
gems, since he wrote later than Constantinus Africanus, and
while he discusses the <i>chelidonius</i>, he says nothing of extracting
it so soon and describes the colors of its two varieties
as black and red,<a id="FNanchor_1374" href="#Footnote_1374" class="fnanchor">[1374]</a> and so does Bartholomew later on.<a id="FNanchor_1375" href="#Footnote_1375" class="fnanchor">[1375]</a> Marcellus
Empiricus had called them black and white.<a id="FNanchor_1376" href="#Footnote_1376" class="fnanchor">[1376]</a> <i>Chelidonius</i>
seems to be derived from the Greek word for swallow,
χελιδών, and to mean the swallow-stone. Pliny mentions
two varieties but simply states that they are like the
swallow in color, not that they come from its gizzard. Furthermore
he describes the color of one as purple on one side,
of the other as “purple besprinkled with black spots.”<a id="FNanchor_1377" href="#Footnote_1377" class="fnanchor">[1377]</a>
Solinus mentions swallows but says nothing of any stone
connected with them. Bartholomew, however, also mentions
the herb <i>celidonia</i> or swallow-wort. He cites Macrobius
for the story that, if anyone blinds the young of swallows,
the parent birds restore their offspring’s sight by
anointing their eyes with the juice of this herb, a statement
which is also found in Pliny.<a id="FNanchor_1378" href="#Footnote_1378" class="fnanchor">[1378]</a> Not only does the swallow
contain gems of great virtue and know of healing herbs; it
has medical properties itself. For instance, blood extracted
from its right wing is a remedy for the eyes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
hoopoe
and magic.</div>

<p>Of the birds described by Bartholomew the <i>upupa</i> or
hoopoe is especially associated with the practice of magic.
Pliny cites the poet Aeschylus as saying that the bird changes
its form;<a id="FNanchor_1379" href="#Footnote_1379" class="fnanchor">[1379]</a> and from Aristotle to modern French peasants
it has been believed to build its nest of human ordure.<a id="FNanchor_1380" href="#Footnote_1380" class="fnanchor">[1380]</a> After
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</span>
quoting Isidore, who in part uses Pliny,<a id="FNanchor_1381" href="#Footnote_1381" class="fnanchor">[1381]</a> for the bird’s supposed
filthy habits, its frequenting sepulchers, and the statement
that anyone anointed with its blood will see demons
suffocating him in his dreams, Bartholomew adds that its
heart is used in sorceries. Students of nature (<i>Phisici</i>) say
that when it grows old and cannot see or fly, its offspring
tear off its outworn pinions and bathe its eyes with the juices
of herbs&mdash;thus just reversing the relation between the swallow
and its young&mdash;and warm it under their wings until its
feathers grow again and, perfectly renovated, it is able to
see and fly as well as they. In Basil’s <i>Hexaemeron</i> a similar
story is told of the filial devotion of young storks toward
their aged parent. The hoopoe’s renovation by its young
also is included in the Latin bestiaries,<a id="FNanchor_1382" href="#Footnote_1382" class="fnanchor">[1382]</a> but Bartholomew appears
to cite <i>Phisici</i> rather than <i>Physiologus</i>.<a id="FNanchor_1383" href="#Footnote_1383" class="fnanchor">[1383]</a> Thomas of
Cantimpré’s chapter on the hoopoe is similar to Bartholomew’s
except that all he says to connect it with magic is that
anointing one’s temples with its blood protects one from
sorcerers and enchanters; but “how this is, Experimenter
does not state.” Vincent of Beauvais gives a somewhat
fuller account of the hoopoe in his <i>Speculum naturale</i> and
the bird’s properties are also treated by Albertus Magnus in
his <i>De animalibus</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1384" href="#Footnote_1384" class="fnanchor">[1384]</a> and in the <i>De mirabilibus mundi</i> ascribed
to him, also by Petrus Hispanus in the <i>Thesaurus
pauperum</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1385" href="#Footnote_1385" class="fnanchor">[1385]</a> and by Arnald of Villanova in <i>Remedia contra
maleficia</i>. For the use of the bird’s heart in magic Vincent
cites a <i>Liber de natura rerum</i>, which perhaps is the <i>Liber
rerum</i> cited by Thomas of Cantimpré, who, however, in
that case failed to copy the statement in question. Vincent
attributes to “Pythagoras in <i>The Book of the Romans</i>,”
the statement that sprinkling a sleeping person with the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</span>
blood of the hoopoe will cause him to see phantasms of
demons, which is essentially the same statement that Bartholomew
draws from Isidore and Pliny. But Bartholomew
sometimes cites Pythagoras in <i>The Book of the Romans</i>.
These instances show the difficulty of dealing with medieval
citations, but on the whole indicate that Vincent used independently
the same sources as Thomas and Bartholomew
and made a different selection from them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Waters
and fish.</div>

<p>In the thirteenth book Bartholomew deals with the element
water, with wells, streams, seas, ponds, pools, and
drops of water, with some particular bodies of water such
as the Tigris, Euphrates, Jordan, Lake of Tiberias, and
Mediterranean Sea. In the last chapter fish are considered.
As in the account of birds, use is made of Isidore and Pliny,
notably concerning the cleverness with which fish escape the
snares laid for them by fishermen. Some fish are said to
help their fellows withdraw from the basket-like traps set
for them by fishermen by seizing their tails in their mouths
and pulling them out backwards. Aristotle, too, is cited and
Avicenna is referred to several times on the question whether
a particular fish is edible or not. But an authority especially
employed in this chapter is Jorath or Iorat, who in the bibliography
at the end of the work is called a Chaldean. From
his book on animals Bartholomew takes such details as that
there are fish who live only three hours, who conceive from
dew alone or in accord with the phases of the moon and the
rising and setting of the stars. Dolphins, when a man is
drowning, can tell from the odor whether he has ever eaten
the flesh of a dolphin. If he has not, they rescue him and
bring him safe to land; if he has, they devour him on the
spot.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Jorath on
whales.</div>

<p>Bartholomew also depends upon Jorath for his account
of whales, which were not treated of by Pliny. The whale
possesses a superabundance of sperm which floats on the
water and, when collected and dried, turns to amber. When
hungry, the whale has only to open its mouth and emit a fragrant
odor like amber, and the other fish, attracted and delighted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</span>
thereby, swim into its jaws and down its throat. On
some occasions, however, this pleasant breath, if it may be
so termed, of the whale saves the other fish instead of luring
them on to destruction. When a certain serpentine and
venomous fish approaches, they take refuge behind the whale,
who then repels the fetid odor of the newcomer by the
sweetness of his own effusion. While Bartholomew lists
the whale along with fish, he notes that Jorath says that
terrestrial matter dominates in it over water, and that consequently
it becomes very corpulent and fat, and in its old
age dust collects on its back to such an extent that vegetation
grows there and the creature is often mistaken for an
island and lures sailors to their destruction,&mdash;a reminiscence,
we may suppose, of one of Lucian’s stories. So fat is the
whale that he must be wounded deeply to feel it at all, but
once his inner flesh is reached by the weapon, he cannot endure
the bitterness of the salt water, seeks the shore, and is
easily captured. The whale cherishes its young with wondrous
love, and when they are stranded on shoals it frees
them by spouting water over them. When a severe storm is
raging, it swallows them and they abide safely in its belly
until the storm is past, when it vomits them forth again.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Geography,
physical
and
political.</div>

<p>In the fourteenth book Bartholomew treats of earth, and
besides defining mountains, hills, valleys, plains, fields,
meadows, deserts, caves, and ditches in general, describes
over thirty particular peaks or mountain ranges, most of
which are named in the Bible, like Ararat, Bethel, Hermon,
Hebron, and Horeb. But in the fifteenth book, on Provinces,
his geography is that of classical antiquity and of the
feudal world of his own time rather than that of Scripture.
Where the medieval region was known under the same name
in antiquity, he is apt to continue to use the old description
of it, even though it may be really out-of-date and no longer
closely applicable. Sometimes, however, as in the chapter
on Burgundy, he uses only a little of Isidore’s description
and apparently writes the rest of the paragraph from personal
knowledge. And in the case of new localities and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</span>
names, for which he can find no ancient and early medieval
authorities, he describes the province intelligently and accurately
as it is in his own time. On the whole his account,
although its 175 chapters are brief, is of considerable value<a id="FNanchor_1386" href="#Footnote_1386" class="fnanchor">[1386]</a>
for the political geography of Europe in the thirteenth century,
both as a general survey showing what regions he
deemed important enough to mention<a id="FNanchor_1387" href="#Footnote_1387" class="fnanchor">[1387]</a> and what he thought
might be omitted, and also often for particular details concerning
particular places, while it is sometimes enlivened by
the spice of local or racial prejudice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</span></p><div class="sidenote">Also
economic.</div>

<p>Citing Isidore, Bartholomew divides the world as in a T
map into Asia, occupying one-half the circle, and Europe
and Africa each occupying a quarter. Indeed he says later
that Africa is smaller than Europe;<a id="FNanchor_1388" href="#Footnote_1388" class="fnanchor">[1388]</a> Africa of course had
not yet been circumnavigated. In speaking of Alemannia he
alludes to other provinces “in either Germany” which are
not included in his list of chapter headings: Austria and
Bavaria near the Danube, Alsace along the Rhine, “and
many others which it would be tedious to enumerate one by
one.”<a id="FNanchor_1389" href="#Footnote_1389" class="fnanchor">[1389]</a> He describes Apulia as the maritime region in Italy
separated from the island of Sicily by an arm of the sea, and
as a very populous land, full of gold and silver, rich in grain,
wine, and oil, famous for its renowned cities, well fortified
in castles and towns, fertile and fecund in varied crops. Brindisi
(Brundusium) is its metropolis, and across the sea from
Apulia to the south is Barbary.<a id="FNanchor_1390" href="#Footnote_1390" class="fnanchor">[1390]</a> Bartholomew thus uses the
term “Apulia” as “Le Puglie” is used today, to include
both ancient Apulia and Calabria, which he does not mention
by that name. His description testifies to the greater
prosperity of that region under the Normans and Frederick
II than in later times, and also shows that Bartholomew
is not blind to economic conditions in his survey of various
regions. He is very apt, indeed, to tell whether the soil is
well-watered and fertile or rocky and arid, and to describe
the other resources of the district and the characteristics of
the peoples inhabiting it. He speaks in high praise of the
extensive dominions and sea-power of Venice and of the
justice and concord of its citizens.<a id="FNanchor_1391" href="#Footnote_1391" class="fnanchor">[1391]</a> He also recognizes the
importance of the wool trade between England and Flanders.<a id="FNanchor_1392" href="#Footnote_1392" class="fnanchor">[1392]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Medieval
boundaries.</div>

<p>Bartholomew often undertakes to state the boundaries
of a region under discussion. Sometimes he is clear and
convincing in this, as when he states that Gascony used to
be a part of Aquitaine, that it is bounded by the Pyrenees,
the Ocean, and the county of Toulouse, and approaches the
territory of the Poitevins to the north; that it is drained by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</span>
the Garonne river and that Bordeaux is its metropolis.<a id="FNanchor_1393" href="#Footnote_1393" class="fnanchor">[1393]</a>
Sometimes his statements are confusing, but we must remember
that feudal states were very difficult to bound exactly
and varied greatly in extent from time to time. Some mistakes
in the points of the compass are perhaps slips of copyists
rather than of Bartholomew. He speaks of Brabant and
Lorraine as the westernmost or frontier provinces of Germany.
Brabant is bounded on the north by Frisia, the
Britannic Ocean (North Sea), and the Gulf of Flanders;
on the west by lower Gaul and on the south by upper France.
It is watered by the Meuse and Scheldt.<a id="FNanchor_1394" href="#Footnote_1394" class="fnanchor">[1394]</a> Lorraine is
bounded by Brabant, the Rhine, Alsace, the region of Sens,
and Belgic Gaul. Metz is located in it.<a id="FNanchor_1395" href="#Footnote_1395" class="fnanchor">[1395]</a> Flanders is a province
of Belgic Gaul next the seacoast, with Germany to the
east, the Gallic sea to the west, and the region of Sens and
Burgundy to the south.<a id="FNanchor_1396" href="#Footnote_1396" class="fnanchor">[1396]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">France in
the thirteenth
century.</div>

<p>Bartholomew is uncertain whether France is named from
the Franks or from a free hangman (<i>a franco carnifice</i>) who
became king at Paris and from whom the executioners received
privileges. Isidore does not mention <i>Francia</i>, so that
Bartholomew does not derive this etymology from him. He
seems uncertain also whether to identify France with all
ancient Gaul or simply with Belgic Gaul. He would carry
it south only to the province of Narbonensis and the Pennine
Alps, but east to the Rhine and Germany. This perhaps
is an attestation of the growing territorial power of
the French monarch, but perhaps is also a hold-over from
the ancient boundaries of Gaul. At any rate many of his
other regions would overlap and conflict with a France of
this size. He extols the stone and cement about Paris, which
give it an advantage over other localities in building construction,
and he further eulogizes the city itself as the
Athens of his age which elevates the science and culture not
of France only but all Europe.<a id="FNanchor_1397" href="#Footnote_1397" class="fnanchor">[1397]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Brittany
and the
British
Isles.</div>

<p>Léopold Delisle, writing in the <i>Histoire Littéraire de la
France</i>, endeavored to claim Bartholomew as a Frenchman,
despite the <i>Anglicus</i> that regularly accompanies his name.
Yet for all Bartholomew’s praise of Paris and Venice, his
chapters on England, Ireland, Scotland, and Brittany<a id="FNanchor_1398" href="#Footnote_1398" class="fnanchor">[1398]</a> are
alone almost enough to determine his nationality. He asserts
that Brittany should be called <i>Britannia Minor</i>, and the
island <i>Britannia Maior</i> or Great Britain, since Brittany was
settled by fugitive Britons from the island and the daughter
should not be raised to an equality with the mother country,
especially since it cannot equal Great Britain either in
population or merit.<a id="FNanchor_1399" href="#Footnote_1399" class="fnanchor">[1399]</a> Also Bartholomew represents the
Irish as savages<a id="FNanchor_1400" href="#Footnote_1400" class="fnanchor">[1400]</a> and describes the Scots in very unfavorable
terms. His view is that if they have any good customs, they
borrowed them from the English. He admits, however, that
the Scots would be good-looking in face and figure, but then
adds the insulting condition, if they would not insist on deforming
themselves by wearing their national costume.<a id="FNanchor_1401" href="#Footnote_1401" class="fnanchor">[1401]</a> But
as for England, or Albion as it was once called, after describing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</span>
it as the largest island in the (Atlantic) ocean and recounting
some of its legends and history, Bartholomew
quotes a metrical description of it as a fertile corner of the
world, a rich island which has little need of the rest of the
world but whose products all the rest of the world requires,
and whose people are happy, jocose, and free of mind, tongue,
and hand.<a id="FNanchor_1402" href="#Footnote_1402" class="fnanchor">[1402]</a> Censure of and prejudice against all others who
claim to be British, ill-concealed insular pride! Who can
doubt that the writer is an Englishman?</p>

<div class="sidenote">A geography
by
Herodotus.</div>

<p>Some writer named Herodotus is cited a good deal by
Bartholomew for such regions as Poitou, Picardy, Saxony,
Sclavia, Scotland, and Thuringia, of which the Greek historian
Herodotus of course knew nothing and said nothing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Two
passages
about
magic.</div>

<p>The inhabitants of Finland, we are told, are a barbarous
race “occupied with magic arts.” They practice divination
by means of the number of knots in a ball of thread and
sell favorable winds to the sailors who navigate along their
shores. In reality, Bartholomew explains, the demons send
the winds or not, in order to secure the souls of the Finns
in the end.<a id="FNanchor_1403" href="#Footnote_1403" class="fnanchor">[1403]</a> While we are on the subject of magic, a passage
from Bartholomew’s next book may be noted.<a id="FNanchor_1404" href="#Footnote_1404" class="fnanchor">[1404]</a> Discussing
the gem Heliotrope, he cites Isidore for the statement
that “it manifests the stupidity of enchanters and
magicians who glory in their prodigies, for they deceive
men’s eyes in their operations just as this gem does, of which
he says by way of illustration that together with the herb
of the same name and certain incantations it deceives the
gaze of the spectators and causes them not to see the man
who carries it.” But when we turn to the <i>Etymologies</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1405" href="#Footnote_1405" class="fnanchor">[1405]</a>
we find that Isidore simply quotes the sentence of Pliny,
“This too is a manifest instance of the impudence of the
magicians that they say that the bearer of this stone cannot
be seen if he joins to it the herb Heliotrope and adds certain
prayers.” Bartholomew has evidently put his own interpretation
upon the passage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</span></p><div class="sidenote">Bartholomew
and
Arnold of
Saxony
on stones.</div>

<p>The last passage has introduced us to Bartholomew’s sixteenth
book on gems, minerals, and metals. Valentin Rose,<a id="FNanchor_1406" href="#Footnote_1406" class="fnanchor">[1406]</a>
in what Langlois praised as “sa belle dissertation sur le <i>De
lapidibus</i> aristotélique et sur le <i>Lapidaire</i> d’Arnoldus
Saxo,”<a id="FNanchor_1407" href="#Footnote_1407" class="fnanchor">[1407]</a> exploited a hitherto obscure German writer, Arnold
of Saxony, who appears to be cited only by Vincent of
Beauvais and of whose works but a single manuscript is
known. Yet Rose would have us believe that Albertus Magnus
made much use of him without acknowledgment in his
work on minerals<a id="FNanchor_1408" href="#Footnote_1408" class="fnanchor">[1408]</a> and that Bartholomew did the same in
his sixteenth book. I shall endeavor to show that it is much
more likely that Arnold copied Bartholomew. First, it is
less likely that Bartholomew, who was called to Magdeburg
to instruct the Saxons, possibly after his <i>De proprietatibus
rerum</i> had been completed, would have borrowed from
one of them than that the opposite should be the case.
Second, Bartholomew’s work is much fuller than Arnold’s
which Rose admits is “meager and mechanical.” Third,
Bartholomew’s work is professedly a compilation; his
object is to cite his authorities and he usually does so
scrupulously; hence if he made much use of Arnold, he
would certainly mention him somewhere. Fourth, in
descriptions of particular stones Arnold of Saxony cites
no authorities but merely makes the lump statement at the
start that he uses Aristotle, Aaron and Evax, by whom he
means Marbod’s poem, and “Diascorides”; Bartholomew on
the other hand in the case of each gem makes distinct citations
from Isidore, <i>Lapidarius</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1409" href="#Footnote_1409" class="fnanchor">[1409]</a> and “Diascorides,” all of
whom he is evidently using directly but with discrimination
and in different combinations in each particular case. Fifth,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</span>
the same stones are treated more fully by Bartholomew than
by Arnold, whose terse descriptions suggest the style of an
abbreviator. Thus Bartholomew devotes two columns to the
sapphire; Arnold gives it but eleven lines. Sixth, although
Rose denied that Arnold used Aristotle and “Diascorides”
except in his other work <i>De virtute universali</i>, and contended
that in his <i>De virtutibus lapidum</i> he used only Marbod and
one other unknown source, in point of fact almost every passage
in Arnold which Rose refers to this unknown source
is given by Bartholomew as from “Diascorides.” If, therefore,
Arnold’s unknown source is not “Diascorides,” it must
be Bartholomew. The natural inference is that while Bartholomew
has made direct use of some treatise passing under
the name of Dioscorides, Arnold has not seen this treatise
itself but has probably condensed or extracted it at second-hand
from Bartholomew without acknowledging his indebtedness
to Bartholomew at all and only vaguely acknowledging
his debt to “Diascorides” in his preface. This inference
is supported by the use made of Isidore on stones by our
two authors; Bartholomew uses Isidore directly and cites
book and chapter; Arnold repeats indirectly through Marbod
a bare skeleton of brief phrases which originally were in
Isidore.<a id="FNanchor_1410" href="#Footnote_1410" class="fnanchor">[1410]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Citations
by Arnold
of Saxony
and by
Bartholomew.</div>

<p>Rose further asserted, without printing the passages in
question to support his contention, that Albertus Magnus
had simply copied a number of citations from Arnold, such
as Jorach on animals, Pictagoras in <i>The Book of the Romans</i>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</span>
Esculapius in <i>De membris</i>, Zeno in <i>De naturalibus</i>,
Velbetus in <i>De sensibus</i>, and Alchyldis <i>De venenis</i>. But we
have already noted that Bartholomew cites Jorath and Pythagoras;
Zeno, too, is in his bibliography, and in the introduction
to his eighteenth book he cites the <i>Liber Escolapii de
occultis membrorum virtutibus</i>. Vincent of Beauvais also
cites these works more than once. I do not believe that
Bartholomew took his citations from Arnold, and I doubt if
either Albert or Vincent did. The probability is that such
books were common property then, however little may be
known about them today, and that it would be as easy then
for anyone to lay his hand on these books as on the works
of Arnold of Saxony, whom Vincent alone mentions. In
discussing other mineral substances than gems, such as
metals, sulphur, salt, soda, glass, Bartholomew cites Aristotle,
Avicenna, and Platearius as well as <i>Lapidarius</i>, Isidore,
and “Diascorides,” but in the seventeenth book on
trees and herbs he continues to cite “Dyascorides” and Isidore,
although also making extensive use of Pliny. In the
eighteenth book on animals his list of authorities widens
again and he cites Solinus, Papias, Marcianus, Aristotle,
Theophrastus, Avicenna, and Isaac, but Pliny continues to
be his chief reliance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Virtues of
animals.</div>

<p>In the introduction to this book Bartholomew takes the
view, supported by the authority both of Pliny and of John
of Damascus,<a id="FNanchor_1411" href="#Footnote_1411" class="fnanchor">[1411]</a> that all kinds of animals were created for
man’s benefit. Even fleas and vermin, like wild beasts and
reptiles, are useful in leading him to recognize his own infirmity
and to invoke the name of God. But furthermore
“there is nothing in the body of an animal which is without
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</span>
manifest or occult medicinal virtue.” Escolapius in <i>The Occult
Virtues of Members</i> states that hemorrhoids may be
cured by sitting on a lion’s skin, and Bartholomew lists other
examples of amulets, ligatures, and suspensions from Pliny
and the <i>Viaticum</i> of Constantinus Africanus as well as
“Dyascorides” and “Pitagoras in <i>The Book of the Romans</i>.”
The knowledge of medicinal herbs and the semi-human emotions
or moral virtues supposed to be possessed by animals
also receive the usual treatment. Bartholomew informs us
that the deadly basilisk loses its venomous character when
burned to an ash, and that its ashes are considered useful in
operations of alchemy and especially in the transmutation of
metals.<a id="FNanchor_1412" href="#Footnote_1412" class="fnanchor">[1412]</a> Jerome and Solinus are cited concerning dragons
who overturn ships by flying against their sails, and of the
use made by the Ethiopians of the blood of dragons against
the summer’s heat and of their flesh for divers diseases. For
as David says, “Thou gavest him for food to the peoples of
Ethiopia.”<a id="FNanchor_1413" href="#Footnote_1413" class="fnanchor">[1413]</a> Marvelous monsters of India are not forgotten,
and Aristotle is cited concerning a terrible man-eating
wolf in India with three sets of teeth, a lion’s foot, a scorpion’s
tail, human face and voice. Its voice is furthermore
terrible like the sound of a trumpet, and it is swift as a deer.<a id="FNanchor_1414" href="#Footnote_1414" class="fnanchor">[1414]</a>
Bartholomew’s credulity and scepticism vary with the attitude
of his authorities. When he finds them in disagreement
over the question whether the beaver castrates itself
in order to escape its hunters&mdash;Cicero, Juvenal, Isidore, and
Physiologus asserting this, while Pliny, Dyascorides, and
Platearius deny it&mdash;he prefers the arguments of the latter,
especially since the experience of his own time supports their
view.<a id="FNanchor_1415" href="#Footnote_1415" class="fnanchor">[1415]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Physiologus.</i></div>

<p>Physiologus is cited a number of times<a id="FNanchor_1416" href="#Footnote_1416" class="fnanchor">[1416]</a> by Bartholomew
concerning the snake, crocodile, elephant, wolf, wild ass or
<i>onager</i>, the onocentaur who is half human and half ass, panther,
siren, and taxo or melus. Rather strangely he does
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</span>
not cite Physiologus in describing the lion. Bartholomew’s
citations of Physiologus bear out the points we have made
in an earlier chapter that Physiologus is one thing, and the
allegorical interpretation of passages cited from Physiologus
another thing, that Physiologus means what it says, “Natural
Scientist,” and not allegorist or moralizer. For although a
primary purpose of Bartholomew’s own work is supposed to
be the elucidation of the truth concealed in Scripture under
the symbolism of natural phenomena, he cites Physiologus
simply for zoological data and omits entirely the moral application
and spiritual allegory which it has become customary
to associate with the term Physiologus. Moreover, much
which Bartholomew ascribes to Physiologus cannot be found
in any of the bestiaries which are commonly associated with
that name.<a id="FNanchor_1417" href="#Footnote_1417" class="fnanchor">[1417]</a> This again shows how the middle ages added
to its ancient authorities.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Color,
odor,
savor,
liquor.</div>

<p>In his nineteenth and last book Bartholomew states that
he will treat “first of color, then of odor, then of savor, last
of liquor.” The discussion of color occupies the first thirty-six
chapters in which Aristotle is more frequently cited than
any other authority. The citations become less numerous
from chapter eleven to thirty-six<a id="FNanchor_1418" href="#Footnote_1418" class="fnanchor">[1418]</a> while particular colors
are being described, and where Bartholomew perhaps gives
us some original information. Isaac seems to be Bartholomew’s
chief authority in the chapters upon smell and taste.
Concerning the latter matter Bartholomew states that the
theories of philosophers and medical men disagree.<a id="FNanchor_1419" href="#Footnote_1419" class="fnanchor">[1419]</a> Under
the caption of Liquor he describes honey, mead, <i>claretum</i>
(which was a mixture of wine, honey, and spices), milk,
butter, and cheese. These last suggest eggs, and chapters 77<span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</span>
to 113 are devoted to those of various animals. The work
then proceeds to consider weights and measures, and concludes
with chapters describing various musical instruments.<a id="FNanchor_1420" href="#Footnote_1420" class="fnanchor">[1420]</a></p>

<p><a id="Footnote_1317" href="#FNanchor_1317" class="label">[1317]</a> Bartholomew has already been
presented in part to English-speaking
readers in Steele’s <i>Medieval
Lore</i>, London, 1907, and more recently
in excerpts in Coulton’s
<i>Social Life in Britain from the
Norman Conquest to the Reformation</i>,
Cambridge, 1918, but their
quotations and most other modern
references to him are based
upon the later medieval English
versions of his work and not upon
his own original Latin text. My
summary is based directly upon
the Latin text as printed by
Lindelbach at Heidelberg in 1488:</p>

<p>“<i>Explicit liber de proprietatibus
rerum editus a fratre Bartholomeo
anglico ordinis fratrum minorum.
Anno domini Mcccclxxxviii kalendas
vero Junii xii.</i>”</p>

<p>I am indebted to the liberality
of the John Crerar Library in
Chicago in allowing this rare volume
to be transported to Cleveland
for my use.</p>

<p>I have also checked up the printed
text to some extent by examination
of the following MSS
at Paris. On the whole the discrepancies
between the MSS and
printed version seem slight, although
a modern critical edition
of Bartholomew’s work is certainly
desirable, especially in view
of the rarity of the <i>editio princeps</i>.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_1341" href="#FNanchor_1341" class="label">[1341]</a> Since I completed this chapter
in manuscript form there has appeared
in print G. C. Coulton’s
<i>Social Life in Britain from the
Conquest to the Reformation</i>,
Cambridge, 1918, in which he has
selected almost exactly the same
passages from Bartholomew as
illustrations of his theme. This
is welcome confirmation of their
interest and importance, and I
have decided to let the following
paragraphs stand for two reasons,
despite the fact that they
are now available elsewhere in
English. In the first place any
description of the <i>De proprietatibus
rerum</i> would seem rather
incomplete without them. In the
second place Mr. Coulton gives
the passages in Trevisa’s English
translation, while I have made a
translation direct from the Latin
text in more modern English.
The exaggerated impression of
quaintness and illiteracy which the
old English version makes upon
the modern reader finds in my
opinion little or no justification
in the original Latin. Men apparently
could think more directly
in Latin in the thirteenth century
than they could express themselves
in English in the fourteenth
or fifteenth century.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_1398" href="#FNanchor_1398" class="label">[1398]</a> Of these four chapters Delisle
(HL XXX, 353-65) quoted only
that on England. Delisle gave extracts
from Bartholomew’s descriptions
of several French provinces
to show that he knew them
well and stated that he gave much
fewer details concerning England,
but that he (Delisle) would
transcribe the chapter “parce
qu’on pourrait supposer qu’il renferme
des allusions à la prétendue
origine anglaise de Barthélemi.”
Delisle also cited (p. 362) the
chapter on Britannia, but omitted
the statements which I shall cite,
and earlier said (p. 358), “Nous
n’avons rien à relever dans les
chapitres de la Normandie, de la
Bretagne,” etc.</p>

<p>Yet the statements I shall cite
occur in both the MSS which
Delisle used, where the chapter on
Britannia is continued beyond the
point where his quotation leaves
off as follows:</p>

<p>BN 16098, 13th century, fol.
14Or. “Est autem alia britannia
minor super oceanum aquitanicum
sita in partibus galliarum que a
britonibus relinquentibus britanniam
maiorem propter importunitatem
germanorum est usque
hodie populata, vero usque adhuc
genus britonum et nomen perseverat,
et quamvis hec britannia
in multis laude digna sit, non potest
tamen filia matri, minor
britannia maiori comparari, et
immo bene minor britannia debuit
vocari que sicut nec numero
populi sic nec merito soli potest
maiori britannia adequari.”</p>

<p>BN 347, 14th century, fol. 145,
is the same except that <i>tamen</i>
precedes <i>potest</i>, and that the
words <i>minor britannia maiori
comparari et immo bene</i> are
omitted, evidently by the mistake
of a copyist who has jumped from
one <i>minor</i> to the next <i>minor</i> and
thus inadvertently omitted the intervening
words.</p>

He used some Frankfurt edition
of the <i>De proprietatibus rerum</i>

he usually fails to state what
chapter of Bartholomew he is
citing, but refers to him simply
by the letter B. Also he fails to
note that the first two stones listed
by Arnold, namely, <i>abeston</i> (asbestos)
and <i>absictus</i> (<i>apsyctos</i>)
are both in Bartholomew, and
what is more, are spelled exactly
the same by both authors. Nor
are these the only gems that Rose
fails to note are treated of by
both authors. Others are <i>alabandina</i>,
<i>calcofanus</i> (which Bartholomew
begins with a k), <i>virites</i> or
<i>pyrites</i> (also spelled a little differently
in Bartholomew), and <i>turcois</i>
(<i>De turchoge</i> in Bartholomew).

<div class="sidenote">Chief
sources
for Robert
Grosseteste.</div>

<p>The fame of Robert Grosseteste,<a id="FNanchor_1421" href="#Footnote_1421" class="fnanchor">[1421]</a> who lived from about
1175 to 1253 and was bishop of Lincoln during the last
eighteen years of his life, rests largely upon the praises of his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</span>
countrymen and contemporaries, Matthew Paris and Roger
Bacon, and upon his own writings. The historian, Matthew
Paris, depicts him especially as the man of affairs, the
churchman and statesman who dared oppose either king or
pope for England’s sake. But with his repeated resistance
in parliament to royal financial exactions, his outspokenness
against abuses at the papal court and his refusal to admit
papal provisors to benefices in his diocese, his aggressive and
reforming activity in his bishopric and consequent quarrels
with the monastic orders and his own cathedral chapter&mdash;with
all this side of his career we are little concerned. It is
rather as a great scholar of his time that like Roger Bacon
we shall look back upon him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reasons
for Roger
Bacon’s
eulogy.</div>

<p>Bacon’s eulogies of Grosseteste may seem rather extravagant.
Writing fourteen years after his death he thinks that
no living scholar can compare with him, nay, he ranks him
and Adam Marsh, another Englishman of whom we know
little, as in their day what Solomon, Aristotle and Avicenna
were in theirs.<a id="FNanchor_1422" href="#Footnote_1422" class="fnanchor">[1422]</a> One reason for this high praise is presumably
that Grosseteste had been Bacon’s favorite teacher, and
certainly that he was interested in the same learned pursuits,
Greek and Hebrew, mathematics, optics, experimental
science, as the friar who followed him. Roger practically
admits that he owes much in those fields to Robert and an
examination of Grosseteste’s writings makes this fact still
more evident.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Grosseteste’s
scholarly
career.</div>

<p>A letter by Giraldus Cambrensis written before the close
of the twelfth century speaks of the then youthful Grosseteste
as already proficient in law and medicine. He seems
to have been born of humble and poor parents at Stradbrook
in Suffolk.<a id="FNanchor_1423" href="#Footnote_1423" class="fnanchor">[1423]</a> He was educated at Oxford where he became
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</span>
<i>rector scholarum</i> and Chancellor and in 1224 the first rector
of the Franciscans at Oxford. He perhaps also studied at
Paris. After holding various archdeaconries and other prebends
he was elected bishop of Lincoln in 1235 but continued
his interest in the welfare of the university at Oxford.
Roger Bacon, in affirming that Grosseteste surpassed all
others in knowledge of the sciences, gives as a reason his long
life and experience as well as his enthusiasm for study;<a id="FNanchor_1424" href="#Footnote_1424" class="fnanchor">[1424]</a>
and in another passage declares that hitherto it has taken
thirty or forty years for a man to become really proficient
in mathematics, as the case of Robert Grosseteste among
others shows.<a id="FNanchor_1425" href="#Footnote_1425" class="fnanchor">[1425]</a> Bacon also states that it was not “until the
latter portion of his life” that he undertook the work of
making translations and summoned Greeks and had grammars
brought from Greece and other lands. Since Grosseteste
appears at first to have studied law and medicine rather
than ancient languages and mathematical sciences, Bacon’s
statements suggest that the works of Grosseteste which we
are about to consider were written late in life. This inference
is further borne out by a passage in the treatise <i>De
impressionibus aeris seu de prognosticatione</i> which gives the
positions of the seven planets in the signs of the zodiac and
states the date as “the Arabic year 646 or the year of grace
1249.”<a id="FNanchor_1426" href="#Footnote_1426" class="fnanchor">[1426]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">His
writings:
absence
of magic.</div>

<p>Our discussion of Grosseteste will be based upon some
treatises included in Baur’s edition of his philosophical
works. They are mostly brief and in some cases seem rather
fragmentary. We shall not be concerned with his Greek
grammar or with his theological writings, which occupy half
of the bibliography in Pegge’s Life.<a id="FNanchor_1427" href="#Footnote_1427" class="fnanchor">[1427]</a> His letters contain
some hints of his scientific works but nothing bearing on
magic or astrology. It used to be stated that Grosseteste
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</span>
certainly constructed charms to expel maladies, that he invented
forms of words to exorcise fiends, and that he worked
cures by engraved gems.<a id="FNanchor_1428" href="#Footnote_1428" class="fnanchor">[1428]</a> The ascription to Grosseteste of
treatises on Necromancy and Sorcery, and the Philosopher’s
Stone, is, however, false and grew, Baur says, from marginal
glosses appended to one of his genuine works.<a id="FNanchor_1429" href="#Footnote_1429" class="fnanchor">[1429]</a> What we
shall note in Grosseteste’s works will be mainly his attitude
to experimental science on the one hand and to astrology on
the other.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Scientific
writings
little affected
by
his ecclesiastical
position.</div>

<p>In these scientific treatises by Grosseteste there is little
to suggest the Christian bishop. However, in the work “On
the Fixity of Motion and Time” he opposes the Aristotelian
doctrine that the universe or motion of the celestial bodies is
eternal.<a id="FNanchor_1430" href="#Footnote_1430" class="fnanchor">[1430]</a> And in a second treatise, “On the Order of the
Emanation of Things Caused from God,” he expresses the
wish that men would cease to question the scriptural account
of the age and beginning of the world.<a id="FNanchor_1431" href="#Footnote_1431" class="fnanchor">[1431]</a> A third treatise “On
Freedom of the Will” also lies on the frontier of philosophy
and theology.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reliance
on experience.</div>

<p>Grosseteste affords us further examples in a number of
passages of that reliance upon experience and reason, that
rejection of certain views as contrary to experience, and
yet that acceptance of statements in old authors as based
upon experience, which we saw in Galen and William of
Auvergne’s “experimental books,” and shall see in Albertus
Magnus and the other medieval scientists. Grosseteste
speaks, however, not merely of experience or <i>experimenta</i>,
but also of experimenters (<i>experimentatores</i>).<a id="FNanchor_1432" href="#Footnote_1432" class="fnanchor">[1432]</a> We may
first note some use of observation and experience in astronomy
and geography. In his treatise on comets he alludes to
“experience in natural things.”<a id="FNanchor_1433" href="#Footnote_1433" class="fnanchor">[1433]</a> In his treatise on the
Sphere<a id="FNanchor_1434" href="#Footnote_1434" class="fnanchor">[1434]</a> Bishop Robert declares that the sphericity of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</span>
earth and of all the stars and planets “is shown both by
natural reasons and astronomical experiences,” that is, in the
case of the earth, by the observations of the sky by men in
different parts of the earth. In the same work he says that
Thabit ben Corra (836-901 A. D.) working over the operations
of Ptolemy, “found by certain experiments that the
motion of the fixed stars was different.”<a id="FNanchor_1435" href="#Footnote_1435" class="fnanchor">[1435]</a> Likewise in his
treatise <i>On the Generation of the Stars</i> Grosseteste remarks
of one contention that “experience shows the contrary” and
of another view that it “is against both experience and reason.”<a id="FNanchor_1436" href="#Footnote_1436" class="fnanchor">[1436]</a>
Again in writing <i>Of the Nature of Places</i> he adduces
in support of his positions “experiments and reasons,”
and “divers authors and experimenters.”<a id="FNanchor_1437" href="#Footnote_1437" class="fnanchor">[1437]</a> The old legend
of the Hyperboreans who dwell among mountains near the
pole in such a salubrious and temperate climate that they live
on and on until they tire of life and commit voluntary suicide
by leaping off cliffs into the sea, Grosseteste introduces
by the statement: “It has also been found by experience, as
authors tell”&mdash;among whom he names Pliny, Solinus, and
“Marcianus in his geometry.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Theory of
vision and
science of
perspective.</div>

<p>In the realm of physics Grosseteste not only mentions
experience in discussing vision and what he calls Perspective
but also brings to our notice a recent or approaching
experimental discovery, that of magnifying lenses. In his
treatise on the rainbow he makes a rather unpromising beginning.
After arguing whether the sense of sight operates
by the eye receiving something within itself, as natural philosophers
are prone to hold, or by sending forth a visual species
or rays, he decides as was usual with men of his time
in favor of the latter alternative.<a id="FNanchor_1438" href="#Footnote_1438" class="fnanchor">[1438]</a> He cites Aristotle in his
last book on animals as saying that a man with deep-set eyes
sees farther because his visual virtue is not spread or scattered
but goes straight&mdash;as if from a long-barreled gun&mdash;to
the things seen.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Experimental
discovery
of lenses.</div>

<p>Grosseteste then goes on to say that there are three parts
of Perspective. The first is that concerning the sight with
which he has just been dealing. The second concerns mirrors.
The third has been “untouched and unknown among
us until the present time. Yet we know that Aristotle completed
this third part”&mdash;he of course did nothing of the
sort&mdash;“and that it is much more difficult in its subtlety and
far more wonderful in its profound knowledge of natures
than the other parts. For this branch of Perspective thoroughly
known shows us how to make things very far off
seem very close at hand and how to make large objects
which are near seem tiny and how to make distant objects
appear as large as we choose, so that it is possible for us
to read the smallest letters at an incredible distance, or to
count sand or grain or grass or any other minute objects.”<a id="FNanchor_1439" href="#Footnote_1439" class="fnanchor">[1439]</a>
So far the passage reads as if it might be merely the exaggerated
dream of fancy. But Grosseteste proceeds to state
“how these marvels happen,” which seems to be by the breaking
up of “the visual ray”&mdash;or as we should say, by the refraction
of rays of light&mdash;as it passes through several transparent
objects or lenses of varying nature. He explains also
that great distance does not make an object invisible but the
narrowness of the angle under which it is seen.<a id="FNanchor_1440" href="#Footnote_1440" class="fnanchor">[1440]</a> This he
proceeds to illustrate “by experiments” (<i>per experimenta</i>).
Again in his treatise on comets he mentions “those who have
experienced that by a transparent figure interposed between
the spectator and the object seen it is possible that the thing
seen should be multiplied and that great things seem small
and conversely according to the shape given the interposed
transparent object.”<a id="FNanchor_1441" href="#Footnote_1441" class="fnanchor">[1441]</a> I have given as far as possible a literal
translation of Grosseteste’s words on this point in order
to convey his exact or inexact meaning. If these passages
are not a sufficient proof that magnifying lenses of some
sort were already discovered, they at least point the way to
the microscope and telescope, and we know that eye-glasses
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</span>
for nearsightedness were in use at the latest by the end of
the thirteenth century.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Theories
formed
by experimenters
with
lenses.</div>

<p>Returning to Grosseteste and experimental method we
may note his mention in the same treatise upon comets of
“those who reflect and experiment in natural phenomena and
form their opinions from their experiments without foundation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</span>
of reasons.”<a id="FNanchor_1443" href="#Footnote_1443" class="fnanchor">[1443]</a> Grosseteste holds that such experimenters
“necessarily fall into false notions concerning the
natures of comets,” because they try to explain them as reflected
rays and the like after the analogy “of their varied
experiments which they have employed in radiations and the
producing of fires”&mdash;probably by burning glasses&mdash;“and by
what is seen through the medium of lenses” (<i>diaphanorum</i>).
The important point for us, however, is not whether these
men were wrong about comets, but their varied experimentation
and their basing of hypothesis upon their experiments.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mathematical
physics:
the radiation
of
virtue.</div>

<p>In view of Grosseteste’s interest in physical and astronomical
matters, and his training, if we believe Bacon, for
some thirty or forty years in mathematics, it is not surprising
that he realized something of the value of mathematics
in the study of natural science. He believed that a knowledge
of geometry was of great aid to the “diligent investigator
of natural phenomena” in explaining the causes of all natural
effects. In a treatise “On lines, angles and figures,” or
“On refraction and reflexion of rays,” Grosseteste holds
that not only vision or light but every natural agent sends
forth its virtue to the object affected and acts upon sense
or matter along geometrical lines.<a id="FNanchor_1444" href="#Footnote_1444" class="fnanchor">[1444]</a> This doctrine of radiation
or emanation of force seems to date back at least to
Plotinus, and we have heard Alkindi among the Arabs in his
treatise on Stellar Rays say that the stars and all objects
in the world of the four elements emit rays of this sort.
From any given agent virtue radiates forth in all directions,
but a perpendicular line is the shortest and strongest line of
force between it and any other single point or object. From
a point or center of influence to a larger surface we get
pyramids or cones of radiated force. The same theory is
set forth by Roger Bacon under the name “multiplication of
species” but even this wording is not new with him, since
Grosseteste speaks of the natural agent as “multiplying its
virtue” from itself to the thing affected, and then explains
that this virtue is also sometimes called “species” and sometimes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</span>
“similitude” and is the same in whatever way it is
named.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The <i>Computus</i>
and
calendar
reform.</div>

<p>The <i>Computus</i>, or treatise on reckoning time and keeping
track of Easter especially and also other church festivals, had
been a variety of mathematical and astronomical exercise indulged
in by the clergy even in the darkest periods of the
early middle ages. The <i>Computus</i> of Grosseteste pointed out
the need of reforming the Julian calendar then in use, and
he also called attention to this need in his treatise on <i>The
Sphere</i>. From the later use made of it by Roger Bacon<a id="FNanchor_1445" href="#Footnote_1445" class="fnanchor">[1445]</a>
and by Cardinal Pierre d’Ailly<a id="FNanchor_1446" href="#Footnote_1446" class="fnanchor">[1446]</a> in the early fifteenth century
one infers that Grosseteste’s <i>Computus</i> remained an
authoritative work upon the subject of calendar reform.<a id="FNanchor_1447" href="#Footnote_1447" class="fnanchor">[1447]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Juggling
with
numbers.</div>

<p>On one occasion at least Grosseteste’s interest in mathematics
degenerated into one of those puerile reveries on the
relations and perfection of certain numbers in which so many
authors since Pythagoras, if not before him, had indulged.
Having stated that in “the supreme body” there are four
things, namely, form, matter, composition and compound,
Grosseteste states that form is represented by the number
one, matter by two, and composition by three, “since there is
patent in it formed matter and materialized form and the
property of composition itself.”<a id="FNanchor_1448" href="#Footnote_1448" class="fnanchor">[1448]</a> The compound besides
these three things has its own nature and so is represented
by four. Now 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10. “Wherefore every
whole and perfect thing is ten.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">From
mathematics
to astronomy
to astrology.</div>

<p>That Grosseteste’s “mathematics” includes astronomy
is indicated by his citing “<i>mathematicos</i>” as explaining that
the sun burns the regions under the tropic of capricorn more
than those under the tropic of cancer, because an eccentric
of the sun when it is in capricorn brings it closer to the
earth.<a id="FNanchor_1449" href="#Footnote_1449" class="fnanchor">[1449]</a> These mathematicians disagree on this point with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</span>
the commentator upon Aristotle who believed that the sun
burned more in Cancer. If for Grosseteste mathematics included
astronomy, astronomy also included astrology&mdash;although
he does not usually employ the word <i>mathematicus</i>
for an astrologer. To his attitude toward astrology we now
turn.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Astrology
in natural
philosophy,
agriculture,
alchemy,
medicine
and music.</div>

<p>Grosseteste accepts astronomy or astrology as the supreme
science and says in his treatise on the liberal arts that
natural philosophy needs its aid more than that of the
others.<a id="FNanchor_1450" href="#Footnote_1450" class="fnanchor">[1450]</a> There is scarcely any operation whether of nature
or of man, such as the planting of vegetables, or transmutation
of minerals, or cure of diseases, which can dispense with
astronomical assistance. For inferior nature does not act
except as celestial virtue moves and directs it. He then
goes on to detail the effects of the moon, Saturn, and Mars
on the hour of planting, and then to emphasize the importance
of selecting the favorable hours astrologically in medical
practice and in alchemy where he associates the seven
planets with seven metals.<a id="FNanchor_1451" href="#Footnote_1451" class="fnanchor">[1451]</a> He also argues that the harmony
of the movements of the celestial spheres is found also in
their effects upon the inferior world.<a id="FNanchor_1452" href="#Footnote_1452" class="fnanchor">[1452]</a> Therefore he who
knows the due proportion of the elements in the human body
and the concord of the soul with the body, can restore any
lack of harmony in the same to its proper state.<a id="FNanchor_1453" href="#Footnote_1453" class="fnanchor">[1453]</a> In other
words, diseases and even wounds and deafness should be
curable by music based upon a knowledge of astrology and
mathematics, and one should also be able to control such
emotions as joy, grief, and wrath.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Some astrological
technical
detail.</div>

<p>In another treatise on how to predict the weather (<i>De
impressionibus aeris seu de prognosticatione</i><a id="FNanchor_1454" href="#Footnote_1454" class="fnanchor">[1454]</a>) Grosseteste
says that one must know such things as the powers of the
signs and the natures of the planets.<a id="FNanchor_1455" href="#Footnote_1455" class="fnanchor">[1455]</a> He then relates the
four elements and four qualities to the planets and signs and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</span>
proceeds to such further technical astrological terms as house,
exaltation, <i>triplicitas</i>, <i>terminus</i>, <i>facies</i>, and aspect, and to an
explanation of the effect of the eccentrics of the sun and
moon upon inferior objects.<a id="FNanchor_1456" href="#Footnote_1456" class="fnanchor">[1456]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Man and
the stars.</div>

<p>Grosseteste, like most of our Christian authors, exempts
man in part by virtue of his free will and rational soul from
the control of the stars. One of his brief fragments is entitled
“That man is a microcosm” (<i>Quod homo sit minor
mundus</i>), that is, a replica of the surrounding universe.<a id="FNanchor_1457" href="#Footnote_1457" class="fnanchor">[1457]</a>
One of his arguments for the finiteness of this world and
of the stars is that all things are made for man and that
when he no longer requires the processes of generation and
corruption which the movements of the heavens cause, the
heaven itself will cease to move and time will be no more.<a id="FNanchor_1458" href="#Footnote_1458" class="fnanchor">[1458]</a>
In a treatise on freedom of the will, he follows Augustine in
<i>The City of God</i> in affirming that the rational soul is sublimer
than the stars and in denying that all our actions which seem
to be freely willed by us are predictable from the constellations,
and that fate prevails as a necessity in all inferiors
from the motion of the stars. He admits, however, that the
human body is subject to two forces; as part of the world
of cause it is changed in many ways by the movements of
the stars, but it also is subject to the control of the mind
especially in voluntary actions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Grosseteste’s
theory of
comets.</div>

<p>Grosseteste has an ingenious theory which I do not remember
having met elsewhere to explain why comets are
signs of great disasters. In his treatise on comets he states
that a comet is sublimated fire which has been separated from
terrestrial nature and assimilated to celestial nature.<a id="FNanchor_1459" href="#Footnote_1459" class="fnanchor">[1459]</a> The
cause of this separation and assimilation by which comets
are generated is the virtue of the heavenly bodies. Moreover,
each comet has a particular star of its own which draws
it as iron is drawn by adamant. This star, even if it is one
of the fixed stars, must be related to one of the planets and
hence the comet is under some planet also. Grosseteste then
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</span>
further explains that in every earthly object there are incorporated
through the action of the celestial bodies particles of
a more spiritual sort assimilated to the celestial natures. The
generation of a comet, a process in which these fiery or
ethereal particles are released from matter and carried up on
high, is therefore the first step and sign of a more general
release of the spiritual nature and of the consequent corruption
of the terrestrial objects and compounds concerned,
namely: in the first place, those under the rule of the same
planet as the comet in question, and, in the second place,
those in the region from which the comet was sublimated.<a id="FNanchor_1460" href="#Footnote_1460" class="fnanchor">[1460]</a>
But it is not easy to discern over which region the comet has
especial significance of all those regions which are under the
same parallel in which it appears, unless, concludes Grosseteste
naïvely, it is that region where men are most alarmed
by it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Alchemy.</div>

<p>Grosseteste makes one or two incidental allusions to alchemy
which show that he was a believer in the possibility of
transmuting metals. He avers that nature intended that all
metals should be gold, and that they vary from it only by degrees
of imperfection.<a id="FNanchor_1461" href="#Footnote_1461" class="fnanchor">[1461]</a> In another passage<a id="FNanchor_1462" href="#Footnote_1462" class="fnanchor">[1462]</a> he mentions a
theory of “the doctors of alchemy” that in each natural object
there is, besides the four elements composing it, a fifth
essence, unchangeable in itself but alterable after it has
descended into inferior bodies. Here again we find a connection
between alchemy and astrology.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Other
treatises.</div>

<p>It is probable that not all of Grosseteste’s astrological
writings are included in Baur’s edition. He mentions but
does not publish a Digby manuscript and another of the
thirteenth century in the Bibliothèque Nationale. Both are
astronomical or astrological.<a id="FNanchor_1463" href="#Footnote_1463" class="fnanchor">[1463]</a> A fourteenth century manuscript
in the British Museum contains a treatise of “Grosthede”
on the medicinal virtues of herbs.<a id="FNanchor_1464" href="#Footnote_1464" class="fnanchor">[1464]</a> After the name of
each herb the word “Grosthede” is usually added as if the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</span>
items were extracts from a larger work. The treatise is not
included in Baur’s edition and is perhaps spurious.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Summa
philosophiae</i>
ascribed
to
Grosseteste.</div>

<p>Baur includes in his edition of Grosseteste’s philosophical
works a <i>Summa philosophiae</i> which is longer than the
other scientific treatises put together but which is probably
spurious. The latest authors whom it cites are Alexander
of Hales who died before Grosseteste and Albertus Magnus
who possibly had written many of his works and made his
reputation before 1253 although he lived on until 1280. Its
several mentions of Albert are much more likely, however,
to have been penned by some younger man than Grosseteste.<a id="FNanchor_1465" href="#Footnote_1465" class="fnanchor">[1465]</a>
And unless a passage referring to the death of Simon de
Montfort after the appearance of a comet in 1264<a id="FNanchor_1466" href="#Footnote_1466" class="fnanchor">[1466]</a> is an interpolation,
the <i>Summa</i> cannot be by Grosseteste, unless in
the sense that it represents his teaching or is an incomplete
work of his to which someone else later put the finishing
touches.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its
contents.</div>

<p>The <i>Summa</i> is, like the encyclopedias of Bartholomew
of England and Thomas of Cantimpré, in nineteen books,<a id="FNanchor_1467" href="#Footnote_1467" class="fnanchor">[1467]</a>
a number perhaps chosen in deference to the seven planets
and twelve signs of the zodiac. These books are devoted to
the following topics: 1. the rise of philosophy; 2. truth;
3. science; 4. matter; 5. form; 6. virtue; 7. the first cause;
8. the universe&mdash;one but not eternal; 9. bodies, space, and
vacuum; 10. intelligence and intelligences; 11. the rational
soul; 12. the sensitive soul; 13. the vegetative soul; 14. light;
15. the sphere or heavens; 16. nature, universal and particular,
and natural virtue; 17. elements and compounds; 18.
meteorology; 19. minerals and metals.<a id="FNanchor_1468" href="#Footnote_1468" class="fnanchor">[1468]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Oriental
origin
of philosophy.</div>

<p>The account of the rise of philosophy includes considerable
mention of occult sciences, with which it would seem to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</span>
have been closely associated from the first.<a id="FNanchor_1469" href="#Footnote_1469" class="fnanchor">[1469]</a> The Chaldeans
are called the first famous philosophers. Sem is regarded as
the founder of astrology and Cham, whom some identify
with Zoroaster, is said to have invented the seven liberal arts.
Abraham’s instruction of the Egyptians in astrology and
arithmetic is next mentioned and then Atlas and his nephew
Mercury, and the latter’s grandson Trismegistus, of the same
name, are spoken of. This second Mercurius Trismegistus
was according to Albumasar an illustrious astrologer, pre-eminent
in theology and alchemy and magic and a famous
prophet, but according to Augustine he was very worthless
(<i>vanissimus</i>) in many respects. Long after this Homer
revealed philosophy in his stories and Solomon philosophized
concerning the nature of vegetables and animals, but in parables,
it is believed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Greek
men of
learning.</div>

<p>After mention of Abrachys, the astrologer of King
Nebuchadnezzar, the author then lists the Greek philosophers
from Thales to Socrates.<a id="FNanchor_1470" href="#Footnote_1470" class="fnanchor">[1470]</a> The first philosopher in Italy
was Pythagoras who had been thoroughly instructed in the
science of the stars and magic by the Persians, Chaldeans
and Egyptians. In less than a page a good estimate and
contrast of Plato and Aristotle is made,<a id="FNanchor_1471" href="#Footnote_1471" class="fnanchor">[1471]</a> and the author tries
to explain why until the time of Arabic culture Plato was
almost universally preferred to Aristotle among the Greeks
and Latins. There follows a list of the learned Greeks:
Empedocles, Heraclitus, Hippocrates, Euclid, Archimedes,
and various orators, astronomers, astrologers, and naturalists
(<i>naturales</i>) concluding with “Callisthenes the famous alchemist.”<a id="FNanchor_1472" href="#Footnote_1472" class="fnanchor">[1472]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Arabs and
medieval

<p>Among the Arabs three groups are distinguished of
philosophers, <i>mathematici</i> or astrologers&mdash;among whom we
are amazed to find Julius Firmicus listed, and medical
writers.<a id="FNanchor_1473" href="#Footnote_1473" class="fnanchor">[1473]</a> Thebit also is classed with the Arabs, but Plato
of Tivoli, Costa ben Luca, Algazel, Gundissalinus, Constantinus,

Theophilus Macer, and Philaretus are distinguished
as Christian, and both Rabbi Moses as Hebrews.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ancient

<p>Approaching his own time the author says that there are
many other men whose excellent works of philosophy he
has inspected but of whose names he is ignorant or has his
reasons for keeping silent about.<a id="FNanchor_1474" href="#Footnote_1474" class="fnanchor">[1474]</a> He does, however, name
John the Peripatetic and Alfred, and still more recently
Alexander the Minorite and Albert of Cologne, the friar
preacher, as eminent philosophers and yet not to be considered
authorities. The author nevertheless has no uncritical
veneration for the learned men of the past. He thinks that
with the exception of the Peripatetics very few of them had
a complete or correct knowledge of the principles of nature
and causes of natural phenomena or concerning the transmutation
of the elements and the composition of physical
bodies.<a id="FNanchor_1475" href="#Footnote_1475" class="fnanchor">[1475]</a> Compared with moderns he finds their comprehension
slight, except as they had fewer problems to occupy
them and got results by concentrating for a long time on
these. But he can think of no one among them except
Boethius who was not guilty of some erroneous opinion.
This attitude, however, is perhaps more owing to Christian
prejudice than scientific superiority on our author’s part.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Criticism
of Aristotle
and
the Arabic
text.</div>

<p>Even Aristotle does not escape criticism. We are told
that we should not accept his statement concerning the number
of movers of the heavenly spheres, for, as Avicenna and
Rabbi Moses have pointed out, the science of astronomy was
little developed in his time.<a id="FNanchor_1476" href="#Footnote_1476" class="fnanchor">[1476]</a> Nor are the Arabian commentators
upon Aristotle left uncensured. It is said that some
of the works of Aristotle in their present form smack more
of Arabic loquacity than of Greek eloquence or the Aristotelian
style, and that, especially in the Arabic text, interpolations
and additions and alterations have been made involving
patent anachronisms. Probably there have also been corresponding
omissions.<a id="FNanchor_1477" href="#Footnote_1477" class="fnanchor">[1477]</a> These criticisms of the Arabic text
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</span>
of Aristotle remind us of those which Roger Bacon said
Grosseteste made.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Use of
the word
“modern.”</div>

<p>The author of this <i>Summa</i> is quite fond of employing
the word “modern” which we heard him use above. He also
tells how “Ptolemy, and other more modern <i>mathematici</i>”
introduce epicycles in the orbits of the planets to save appearances,
but have not fully determined “whether it is really
so.”<a id="FNanchor_1478" href="#Footnote_1478" class="fnanchor">[1478]</a> He also speaks of “Avenalpetras and the more modern
Arabs” and calls Albertus Magnus “the most famous of
the more modern theologians.”<a id="FNanchor_1479" href="#Footnote_1479" class="fnanchor">[1479]</a></p>

<p>It is rather outside the limits of our investigation, but I
cannot refrain from noting the <i>Summa’s</i> division of theologians
into three classes: first, those who are original and
have been made saints by the pope; second, those who are
original and have not been sainted; third, the unoriginal
minds who compile <i>Summae</i> from the works of the other
two classes.<a id="FNanchor_1480" href="#Footnote_1480" class="fnanchor">[1480]</a> The author believes that theology may utilize
philosophy to refute heretics but that it must beware of
making philosophy its chief end and should use theological
terms as far as it can.<a id="FNanchor_1481" href="#Footnote_1481" class="fnanchor">[1481]</a> Later he states that there are eight
celestial spheres, according to the philosophers, nine according
to the theologians who include the waters above the
firmament as one.<a id="FNanchor_1482" href="#Footnote_1482" class="fnanchor">[1482]</a> The author divides science into theoretical
or speculative and practical or operative. He also has a
touch of experimental science, asserting that very many experiences
have proved that water will harden into stone,<a id="FNanchor_1483" href="#Footnote_1483" class="fnanchor">[1483]</a> that
the rules of genethlialogy and the predictions of astrologers

of a comet,<a id="FNanchor_1485" href="#Footnote_1485" class="fnanchor">[1485]</a> and that the alchemists had learned from
many experiments that metals can be transmuted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Astrology.</div>

<p>This favoring attitude toward astrology and alchemy is
about all that there is left for us to notice in the <i>Summa</i>.
The author thinks that no one has ever adequately treated
the virtues appropriate to each planet, but quotes Rabbi
Moses and Albumasar somewhat on this point.<a id="FNanchor_1486" href="#Footnote_1486" class="fnanchor">[1486]</a> He has no
difficulty in believing simultaneously in freedom of the will
and genethlialogy.<a id="FNanchor_1487" href="#Footnote_1487" class="fnanchor">[1487]</a> He also cites the passage in Albumasar
concerning the astrological prediction of the virgin birth of
Jesus Christ.<a id="FNanchor_1488" href="#Footnote_1488" class="fnanchor">[1488]</a> In discussing comets, instead of attempting
to explain their signifying disaster to whole regions naturally,
as we heard Grosseteste do in his treatise on comets, the
author of the <i>Summa</i> holds that “they appear of necessity
by the will of God alone, not by chance or nature, but by
the ministry of intelligences.”<a id="FNanchor_1489" href="#Footnote_1489" class="fnanchor">[1489]</a> This was also the case with
the star seen at Christ’s nativity. It may be, however, that
this entire passage about comets and other astrological matters
is an interpolation in the <i>Summa</i>, since it is in it that
the mention of the date 1264 occurs to which we before alluded.
The writer then goes on to say that his master, who
was “most skilled in natural and mathematical science and
most perfect in theology and most holy in life and religion,”
taught him that Noah’s flood was necessitated by a constellation
which God had foreordained for the wickedness of the
then world.<a id="FNanchor_1490" href="#Footnote_1490" class="fnanchor">[1490]</a> This, too, is perhaps a sign of an addition by
some disciple of Grosseteste.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Occult
virtue and
alchemy.</div>

<p>The author of the <i>Summa</i> believes in occult virtue in
nature and attributes it to the stars.<a id="FNanchor_1491" href="#Footnote_1491" class="fnanchor">[1491]</a> He accepts Albertus
Magnus’s explanation of the marvelous virtues of gems as
due to celestial influence.<a id="FNanchor_1492" href="#Footnote_1492" class="fnanchor">[1492]</a> He believes that metals are generated
in the earth by the same force and are seven in number
according to the seven planets, and thinks that this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</span>
process can be simulated by alchemy.<a id="FNanchor_1493" href="#Footnote_1493" class="fnanchor">[1493]</a> In discussing that
subject Hermes is his chief authority. The <i>Summa</i> terminates
by explaining the superiority of steel to iron and listing
various salts.<a id="FNanchor_1494" href="#Footnote_1494" class="fnanchor">[1494]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Brother
Giles on
the comet
of 1264.</div>

<p>Since we have mentioned the comet of 1264, we may note
farther that it was the occasion of a treatise by Brother
Giles of the Order of Dominicans, on the essence, motion,
and signification of comets,<a id="FNanchor_1495" href="#Footnote_1495" class="fnanchor">[1495]</a> in which he cites Grosseteste
<i>De iudiciis</i> and alludes to the death of Pope Urban IV in
that year. The comet was seen in the kingdom of France
from mid-July to October and “stupefied the minds of
many.”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_1421" href="#FNanchor_1421" class="label">[1421]</a> References to Grosseteste’s
works, unless otherwise stated,
will be to Ludwig Baur, <i>Die
Philosophischen Werke des Robert
Grosseteste</i>, Münster, 1912, in
Baeumker’s <i>Beiträge zur Geschichte
der Philosophie des Mittelalters</i>,
Vol. IX. This edition
seems to make little effort to correct
errors of case or number in
the MSS, so that much of the
text is far from being smooth
reading. Baur discussed <i>Die
Philosophie des Robert Grosseteste</i>
in Vol. XVIII (1917) of the
same series. The life of Grosseteste
is treated briefly in DNB,
and more fully in the old and
pedantic work of Samuel Pegge,
<i>The Life of Robert Grosseteste</i>,
London, 1793, 385 quarto pages
with many foot-notes and appendices,
which however are based
mainly on the works of preceding
antiquaries, the author stating in
his preface, “my private station
as a country clergyman would not
permit me to have much access to
public libraries, but the materials
were chiefly to be sought for in
a book-room which, you will easily
suppose, cannot be very richly
or amply furnished.” Pegge’s
Life was already described in
1861 as “one of the scarcest of
modern works”; but the British
Museum possesses two copies.
Other biographies are by J. Felten,
Freiburg, 1887, and F. Stevenson,
London, 1889. The letters
of Grosseteste, which do not especially
concern us, are edited by
H. R. Luard in RS XXV, 1861.</p>

<p>Not to be confused with
Grosseteste is Robertus Anglicus
who wrote a commentary on the
<i>Sphere</i> of Sacrobosco in 1271, a
<i>Tractatus quadrantis</i> at Montpellier
in 1276 (printed 1508), and
<i>Canons for the Astrolabe</i> (printed
at Colle about 1478): see
Duhem, III (1915), pp. 292, 298.</p>

and “experimentation” are used.<a id="FNanchor_1500" href="#Footnote_1500" class="fnanchor">[1500]</a> Similar passages,
however, are also found in Witelo’s main source, the
work of the Arab Alhazen on the same subject.<a id="FNanchor_1501" href="#Footnote_1501" class="fnanchor">[1501]</a> But
Witelo also encourages his readers to go farther and experiment
for themselves, assuring them that “experience more
than books will teach the varied possibilities of images”<a id="FNanchor_1502" href="#Footnote_1502" class="fnanchor">[1502]</a>
from mirrors, suggesting, “Let then the ingenuity of moderns
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</span>
and men of the future add what it shall please,”<a id="FNanchor_1503" href="#Footnote_1503" class="fnanchor">[1503]</a>
and again affirming in the case of burning-glasses, “But
in experimentation with these too there is the greatest
latitude which we leave to those who are curious in such
matters.”<a id="FNanchor_1504" href="#Footnote_1504" class="fnanchor">[1504]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Occult
and astral
virtue.</div>

<p>Witelo also resembles Grosseteste in his favorable attitude
toward astrology and the conception of the radiation
of virtue. Already in his preface to William of Moerbeke
he speaks of that “influence of divine virtues which is made
in marvelous wise in inferior bodies through the virtues of
superior bodies,”<a id="FNanchor_1505" href="#Footnote_1505" class="fnanchor">[1505]</a> of that “divine light” which is “the sensible
medium of corporal influences,”<a id="FNanchor_1506" href="#Footnote_1506" class="fnanchor">[1506]</a> marvelously assimilating
and connecting inferior bodies with superior bodies,
while he compares the influence of the celestial constellations
upon subject bodies to the process of reflection in a mirror.<a id="FNanchor_1507" href="#Footnote_1507" class="fnanchor">[1507]</a>
At the beginning of his tenth book, stating that the virtues of
natural forms increased by refraction act more strongly, he
adds that universally an increase of the virtue of the rays of
the stars or of other forms at the same natural point or
about the same point results in stronger action. Such passages
suggest that perspective or optic was studied not only
for its own sake but for its supposed analogy to the operation
of occult and astral virtue. Indeed in his preface he
represents William of Moerbeke as versed in such occult research,<a id="FNanchor_1508" href="#Footnote_1508" class="fnanchor">[1508]</a>
and William translated not only astrological treatises
but also probably the so-called <i>Ptolemaei de speculis</i>
which is really Hero’s <i>Catoptrica</i>. Baeumker believes that
Witelo for his part was strongly affected by the metaphysical
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</span>
theory in favor with the Neo-Platonists and Gnostics of
primitive light as the origin of intelligence, space, and so on.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Marvelous
effects.</div>

<p>In Witelo’s work may also be noticed something of that
element of thaumaturgy which we noted in Hero of Alexandria.
Thus in his eighth book on concave mirrors he
speaks of the “marvelous diffusion of natural forms and
the multiform deception of the visions beheld,” while in the
ninth book on burning glasses we are promised the production
of astonishing effects. But as a rule Witelo’s presentation
of his subject is geometrical rather than sensational, and
his first book, not paralleled in Alhazen, is a geometry of 137
propositions as a basis for the ensuing “universal axioms of
this science.” As we have seen, however, Witelo employs
the experimental as well as the mathematical method and instruments
as well as theorems.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Further
characteristics.</div>

<p>Unlike Grosseteste, Witelo regards vision by extramission
of rays from the eye as impossible,<a id="FNanchor_1509" href="#Footnote_1509" class="fnanchor">[1509]</a> wherein he follows
Alhazen. Of magnifying lenses he seems to display only a
theoretical knowledge,<a id="FNanchor_1510" href="#Footnote_1510" class="fnanchor">[1510]</a> and to add little to Alhazen on this
point and less to Grosseteste. In general, however, he is believed
by collecting the tradition of the past and filling in the
gaps therein to have made the whole subject clearer to the
Latin world and to have produced a work which served for
several centuries as an excellent text book in the field of optical
science.<a id="FNanchor_1511" href="#Footnote_1511" class="fnanchor">[1511]</a> Its original portion consists especially of observations
made by the author at Padua and Viterbo,<a id="FNanchor_1512" href="#Footnote_1512" class="fnanchor">[1512]</a> which
latter town was also the scene of several of William of
Moerbeke’s translations. The Perspective was probably dedicated
to him about 1270.<a id="FNanchor_1513" href="#Footnote_1513" class="fnanchor">[1513]</a></p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">The
<i>Speculum
Maius</i>.</div>

<p>Of medieval encyclopedists and compilers Vincent of Beauvais
may be ranked as chief by reason of his <i>Speculum Maius</i>,
which really consists of three voluminous “Mirrors,” the
<i>Speculum naturale</i>, with which we shall be chiefly concerned,<a id="FNanchor_1514" href="#Footnote_1514" class="fnanchor">[1514]</a>
and the <i>Speculum doctrinale</i> and <i>Speculum historiale</i>. The
<i>Speculum morale</i>, once attributed to him, has been shown to
be a later production. The <i>Speculum naturale</i> may be regarded
as capping the series begun with Neckam’s <i>De naturis
rerum</i> and continued by Thomas of Cantimpré’s <i>De
natura rerum</i> and Bartholomew of England’s <i>De proprietatibus
rerum</i>. The <i>Mirror of History</i> is a world chronicle
written from the Christian standpoint. The <i>Mirror of Doctrine</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</span>
is not merely concerned with doctrine in the theological
sense but with all fields of art and learning, industry and
society, beginning with a discussion of schools of philosophy
and educational method and a dictionary of some 3200
words, and running through grammar, logic, rhetoric,
poetics, monastic and economic and political institutions, the
useful and military arts, medicine, physics, and natural philosophy,
mathematics and metaphysics, and finally reaching
theology in its seventeenth and last book. Indeed, Vincent
himself well described it as concerned with “all arts,” as the
other two Mirrors reflect “all things” and “all times.”<a id="FNanchor_1515" href="#Footnote_1515" class="fnanchor">[1515]</a> It
is considerably briefer than the <i>Mirror of Nature</i> which
contains almost twice as many books.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Events of
his life.</div>

<p>Little is known of Vincent’s life and the years of his birth
and death are uncertain. He speaks of himself as “Vincent
of Beauvais of the Order of Preachers,” and in 1246 was a
sub-prior of the Dominican monastery at Beauvais. Like
another learned friar of his time, Roger Bacon, he speaks
of laborious duties which interrupted his literary activities
and forced him to employ copyists. Probably the most important
external circumstance of his career was his connection
with the royal family of St. Louis. Although a Dominican,
Vincent held the post of reader in the Cistercian
abbey of Royaumont which Louis had founded in 1228.
Vincent seems to have served Louis IX in the triple capacity
of royal librarian, chaplain, and tutor of the king’s children.
His treatise <i>On the Education of the Royal Children</i> was
composed at some time after the return of St. Louis from
the Holy Land in 1254, and his <i>Consolatory Letter</i> dealt
with the death of Prince Louis in 1260. The date 1264,
often mentioned as that of Vincent’s death, rests on the statement
of Louis à Valleoleti who wrote in the early fifteenth
century. Ptolemy of Lucca who wrote a century nearer to
Vincent’s time cites him concerning the three year vacancy
in the papacy following the death of Clement IV, which
would bring the completion of the <i>Speculum historiale</i> down
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</span>
to 1271 at least, but Daunou showed that this citation was
incorrect and that the passage in question was from Martin
of Poland, not Vincent of Beauvais. This is perhaps also
the case with another passage in Ptolemy of Lucca which
Daunou failed to note and which says, “Historians in general
state, but Vincent in particular writes” of a comet which
portended the death of Pope Urban IV in 1264. Although
the duration of the comet was three months, the pope sickened
as soon as it appeared and died on the very day that it
disappeared.<a id="FNanchor_1516" href="#Footnote_1516" class="fnanchor">[1516]</a> If the citation is from Vincent, he must have
lived beyond 1264.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Was the
<i>Speculum
naturale</i>
finished
in 1250?</div>

<p>It has been customary to give 1250 as the precise date
for the completion of the <i>Speculum naturale</i>, because its last
book, which is geographical and historical, states that it will
bring the history of the world down to the present year,
1250. Valentin Rose accepted this date so confidently as to
argue on the basis of it that, because Vincent did not cite the
work of Albertus Magnus on minerals,<a id="FNanchor_1517" href="#Footnote_1517" class="fnanchor">[1517]</a> that treatise was
not written until after 1250. But that such statements of
the current year in Vincent’s works cannot be relied upon
too implicitly is shown in his <i>Mirror of History</i>. From the
list of popes given in its eighth book we should infer
that it was composed in 1244 or 1245, since it speaks of
Innocent IV as having now sat on the throne for two years;
and again the closing chapter of its thirty-first<a id="FNanchor_1518" href="#Footnote_1518" class="fnanchor">[1518]</a> book states
that the author has brought the history of the sixth age of
the world down to the current year, that is, the eighteenth
of Louis IX and the second of Innocent IV and the
thirty-fourth of Frederick II. But other events are mentioned
which happened in 1250 and 1254.<a id="FNanchor_1519" href="#Footnote_1519" class="fnanchor">[1519]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</span></p><div class="sidenote">Order of
the three
Mirrors.</div>

<p>It is also difficult to determine the order in which the
three Mirrors were completed. Daunou assumed that the
<i>Speculum naturale</i> was finished first, and that the <i>Speculum
doctrinale</i> treated again of some topics which had already
been discussed in the other. He also placed the <i>Speculum
historiale</i> later than the <i>Mirror of Nature</i>, believing that
it was published at some time after 1254 rather than ten
years earlier, and pointing out that in its ninth book Vincent
mentioned having used Pliny’s <i>Natural History</i> in his <i>Speculum
naturale</i>. On the other hand, the revised edition of
Potthast’s <i>Wegweiser</i> regards the <i>Mirror of History</i> as completed
about 1244 before the <i>Mirror of Nature</i>. As an
intermediate work it mentions <i>Memoriale omnium temporum</i>,
an extract in eighty chapters made by Vincent himself
from the <i>Speculum historiale</i>. This extract was then
embodied in the last book of the <i>Speculum naturale</i>, where
an account of the years 1242-1250 was added to it. And
in the last chapter of the <i>Speculum naturale</i>, where the
coming of antichrist and the last judgment are discussed,
we are told that these matters are more fully treated at
the close of the <i>Speculum historiale</i>. Thus we have both
the <i>Mirror of History</i> looking back on the <i>Mirror of
Nature</i> as an earlier work, and <i>vice versa</i>. Thus we apparently
have to do with a revised edition of one or both
of the works, or with later additions and interpolations
which a study of the manuscripts would be necessary to unravel,
although very likely it would fail to do so. One might
hazard the conjecture that the <i>Mirror of History</i> was first
issued in 1244, as it says, and that this edition was the one
cited in the <i>Mirror of Nature</i>; that after 1254 a revised
edition of the <i>Mirror of History</i> was issued and that in this
the <i>Speculum naturale</i> was referred to. There are further
objections even to this view, however, as we shall presently
see.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Chronological
relation
to
Albert and
Aquinas.</div>

<p>If the <i>Speculum naturale</i> as we have it was completed
by 1250, it would aid us in dating works of Albertus Magnus
and Aquinas which it cites. Vincent cites Albert a great deal,
especially for the Aristotelian psychology, often without
definite mention of the title of the work cited, but sometimes
such titles are mentioned as <i>De anima</i>, <i>De sensu et
sensato</i>, <i>De somno et vigilia</i>, <i>De animalibus</i>.<a id="FNanchor_1520" href="#Footnote_1520" class="fnanchor">[1520]</a> Evidently
Albert had already completed many of his commentaries
upon and elaborations of the Aristotelian philosophy, and
had made an established reputation for himself. It is quite
possible that this had been already accomplished by 1250,
since, while Albert lived on until 1280, he was then an old
man. But what is surprising to find in a work written in
1250 are Vincent’s citations of Thomas Aquinas on such
questions as “How an angel instructs the soul?” and “What
prophecy is?”<a id="FNanchor_1521" href="#Footnote_1521" class="fnanchor">[1521]</a> In 1250 Aquinas would have been only
twenty-three and would scarcely have attained the rank of
an authority upon advanced theological problems of this
sort, since he did not receive his doctorate in theology, precocious
as he was, until 1257. Either then these citations
are later interpolations, or Vincent did not complete the
<i>Speculum naturale</i> in 1250. But this problem again calls
for an examination of the earliest manuscripts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">General
character
of the
<i>Speculum
naturale</i>.</div>

<p>The <i>Speculum naturale</i> may be described as a sort of
over-grown <i>Hexaemeron</i>; indeed, in some of the manuscripts
it is entitled, <i>Speculum in Hexemeron libris 32, ex
dictis innumerabilium tam christianorum quam gentilium</i>.<a id="FNanchor_1522" href="#Footnote_1522" class="fnanchor">[1522]</a>
That is to say, its consideration of nature follows the order
of the six days of creation. But the mass of scientific data
is so voluminous as to obscure this underlying Biblical plan,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</span>
and the work is divided not into six books, but thirty-two
and a prologue, or thirty-three in all. The work is, however,
more marked by a theological aim, tone, and interest
than others that we have considered or shall consider. This
is not quite so noticeable as in the <i>Speculum historiale</i>, described
by Daunou as “a work planned and executed in an
essentially theological spirit,”<a id="FNanchor_1523" href="#Footnote_1523" class="fnanchor">[1523]</a> and one of whose four books
on the twelfth century consists entirely of extracts from the
writings of St. Bernard. But as the prologue of the <i>Mirror
of Nature</i> ranks the philosophers and doctors of the Gentiles
as of the third and lowest grade of authority, as its next book
discusses the Trinity and angels as well as the universe, and
the third deals with demons as well as elements and atoms,
so its twenty-fourth book is largely concerned with the soul
and its immortality, the thirtieth with the seventh day of
rest and such topics as fate and providence, sin and penitence,
and the thirty-first with Paradise, the creation and
fall of man, marriage, and so on. We have had other writers
begin with the Trinity and angels and demons but thereafter
deal more exclusively with purely physical phenomena.
We have seen other writers start out with the professed
object of explaining the Scriptures but end by discussing
nature in a purely scientific way. Vincent, on the other
hand, sets out to compile a <i>Mirror of History</i> or a <i>Mirror
of Nature</i> but cannot keep his mind off such themes as the
fall of man and the last judgment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Vincent’s
method of
compilation.</div>

<p>Vincent also adheres rather more strictly to his professed
rôle of a mere compiler than some of our other medieval
writers. He says that he will distinguish his own statements
by the word <i>Actor</i> or <i>Auctor</i>, author or editor, and such
passages are of minor importance and make little or no new
contribution to scientific knowledge. His superiority to
other medieval compilers or encyclopedists consists almost
entirely in the fact that he has had access to a larger library
and has made longer and more numerous excerpts from his
authorities than they. As a rule he does not attempt to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</span>
reconcile conflicting statements in the authorities, warning
his readers in the prologue that he is a mere excerptor and
not to be held responsible for such inconsistencies. Indeed,
he is to such an extent a mere excerptor that it is perhaps
more important to note the authors whom he uses<a id="FNanchor_1524" href="#Footnote_1524" class="fnanchor">[1524]</a> than
the subject-matter which he takes from them and which
we have already been over in large measure, since we
have already considered separately many of his main
sources.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Use of
Pliny and
Aristotle.</div>

<p>Vincent is easily indebted to Pliny, with whose entire
<i>Natural History</i> he seems acquainted,<a id="FNanchor_1525" href="#Footnote_1525" class="fnanchor">[1525]</a> more than to any
other single source and the <i>Speculum naturale</i> is as much an
imitation of it as a development from patristic <i>Hexaemerons</i>.
Another constant reliance is Isidore, who of course in his
turn had used Pliny extensively. Aristotle and various
Arabian authorities&mdash;Rasis, Avicenna, Albumasar, Averroes&mdash;are
frequently cited, but sometimes at least indirectly
through Albertus Magnus. In his preface Vincent apologizes
for often giving Aristotle’s views not in his own words
but in transposed order for the sake of condensation and
clearness. Incidentally he reveals that he had the service of
assistants in compiling his encyclopedia, since he states that
he has not made these renditions of Aristotle himself but
that they have been “excerpted by certain brothers.” At
the same time he shows how familiar the wording of Aristotle’s
text had become by his time and how precise the
standards of medieval scholarship were in some respects,
when he adds that there are some scholars who will not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</span>
tolerate the alteration of one iota or the order of a single
word of the authority.<a id="FNanchor_1526" href="#Footnote_1526" class="fnanchor">[1526]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">More
recent authorities.</div>

<p>Vincent is also not ashamed “to learn from modern
doctors”<a id="FNanchor_1527" href="#Footnote_1527" class="fnanchor">[1527]</a> and employs many works of his medieval Latin
predecessors from Constantinus Africanus, whom he cites
a great deal as Bartholomew did, to Albertus Magnus and
perhaps Thomas Aquinas. He makes some use of the
<i>Natural Questions</i> of Adelard of Bath, which treatise he
once cites as “<i>Adelardus ad nepotem</i>,”<a id="FNanchor_1528" href="#Footnote_1528" class="fnanchor">[1528]</a> and for matters
astronomical he makes much use of the <i>De philosophia</i> or
<i>Dragmaticon</i> of William of Conches. He also repeats its
<i>locus classicus</i> concerning the waters above the firmament
where the view of Bede is rejected for “the more probable
opinion of the moderns in this matter.”<a id="FNanchor_1529" href="#Footnote_1529" class="fnanchor">[1529]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Credulity
concerning
barnacle
birds.</div>

<p>While Vincent shows a wide and commendable acquaintance
not only with a large number of names of authors and
titles, but in many cases with a part or the whole of the
contents of the books themselves, it sometimes appears that
he has not got all that he might have from the authority
in question, and he sometimes does not display the soundest
of judgment in what he includes and what he omits in
making his selections. The case of the barnacle birds may
serve as an illustration. Now Vincent cites the work of
Albertus Magnus on animals concerning falcons in the
very same seventeenth book in which this chapter on the
barnacle birds occurs. With his broad bibliographical attainments
Vincent should have realized the worth of Albert’s
work and should have imbibed some of its sceptical and
critical attitude toward stories of strange and outlandish
animals. Albert had branded as liars those who said that
birds were born from trees, hanging from the trunk and
branches and being nourished by the sap beneath the bark,
or that birds were generated from driftwood at sea, and
that no one had ever seen such birds lay eggs or have sexual
intercourse. Albert and many of his associates had seen
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</span>
them doing both and feeding their young.<a id="FNanchor_1530" href="#Footnote_1530" class="fnanchor">[1530]</a> Yet Vincent
continues to discuss these barnacle birds most credulously.
They feed on driftwood. At birth they are naked but gradually
grow feathers and float through the sea hanging to
the driftwood by their beaks until they come to maturity
and bestir themselves and break away. “And we ourselves
have seen many of them and trustworthy men have testified
that they have seen them hanging thus.” Jacques de Vitry
tells of them in his <i>Oriental History</i>: “It is further to be
noted that they do not hang in the tops of trees but on the
bark of the boughs and trunks. And they grow on the sap
of the tree and the infusion of dew until they have feathers
and strength and break off from the bark. It may be said
with certainty of these birds that in our part of the world
around Germany they neither generate by sexual concourse
nor are generated. Nor has any man among us ever seen
their sexual congress. Consequently some Christians in our
time in those places where birds of this sort abound are accustomed
to eat their flesh in Lent. But Pope Innocent III
in the general council at the Lateran forbade them to do this
any more.”<a id="FNanchor_1531" href="#Footnote_1531" class="fnanchor">[1531]</a> After stating that the barnacle birds eat herbs
and grain like geese and cannot go for long without drink,
Vincent cites a “Philosopher,” but it is not clear whether as
authority for the foregoing statements or the ensuing assertion
that the barnacle bird which is born from trees is found
also in certain parts of Flanders.<a id="FNanchor_1532" href="#Footnote_1532" class="fnanchor">[1532]</a> “Philosopher” in this case
can therefore scarcely be Aristotle. Despite what was said
of the bird’s thirst, it is now added that like trees it has
no superfluity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A sign of
his scientific
inferiority.</div>

<p>Perhaps Vincent had read but little of Albert’s work on
animals; possibly the citations of it in the <i>Speculum naturale</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</span>
are later interpolations; but in any case the passage suggests
a difference in scientific attitude between the two men. It
should be added, however, in Vincent’s favor that his descriptions
of fish were in Cuvier’s opinion more precise and
correct than those of Albert.<a id="FNanchor_1533" href="#Footnote_1533" class="fnanchor">[1533]</a> But in general it seems to
me that he was neither the personal observer of nature that
Albert was, nor did he possess as much scientific discrimination.
This defect is bound to affect his whole selection
of material and use of authorities, and, together with his
somewhat excessive theological bias, makes his compilation,
extensive as it is, scarcely representative of medieval natural
science at its best. At the same time we see that in the very
process of excerpting he gives his compilation a certain
character and tone of its own. It will therefore be well, in
view of its widespread and enduring influence, attested by
numerous manuscripts and printed editions, to give some
attention to its contents, and see what attitude it reflects on
the subjects of magic, astrology, divination from dreams,
and occult virtue in nature.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Demons,
magic,
and superstition.</div>

<p>Vincent’s mentions of magic<a id="FNanchor_1534" href="#Footnote_1534" class="fnanchor">[1534]</a> are incidental to his discussion
of demons and the marvels, transformations, and
divination which they are able to work. On these points
he repeats the views of Augustine, Peter Lombard, and other
like-minded ecclesiastical authorities, and we need not dwell
upon them further, except to note that he makes the demons
inhabit the lower and misty air, and that his citation of
<i>The Golden Ass</i> of Apuleius is probably indirect through
Augustine. We should also note, however, a passage in
the <i>Mirror of Doctrine</i><a id="FNanchor_1535" href="#Footnote_1535" class="fnanchor">[1535]</a> which seems to be largely derived
from the <i>Summa</i> of a “brother William,” which may possibly
be the <i>De universo</i> of William of Auvergne, although he
does not seem to have been a friar. The passage states that
incantations may be used to enchant the sick or children or
animals, provided no superstitious practice which the church
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</span>
has prohibited is involved, and only licit prayers, adjurations,
and such symbols as the sign of the cross are used. Perhaps
the practice of hypnotism is involved here. Vincent believes
that men and women who introduce many useless and superstitious
ceremonies should be forbidden to continue these
practices, which should be confined to priests and to laymen
and women of excellent life and proved discretion. But
he does not object to employment of the divine symbol in
plucking an herb or to writing the Lord’s prayer on a scroll
and placing it near the patient.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Divination
from
dreams.</div>

<p>In his discussion of dreams and their significance Vincent
combines such varied authorities as Aristotle, Avicenna,
Albert, Aquinas, and Pope Gregory the Great, who accounted
for dreams by a full or empty stomach, the thoughts of the
dreamer, the illusions of demons, and the revelations of
angels. While recognizing with the Bible that dreams make
many err, Vincent agrees “with the saints and prophets
that dreams frequently signify something concerning the
future.” Dreams are powerfully affected by the motion
of the stars in the sky, which is scarcely noticed when we
are awake but is manifest in sleep. Dispositions, too, on the
part of the sleeper make themselves felt in dreams which
are not observed in waking hours, a medieval statement of
the Freudian theory. Dreams are not causes but simply
signs of the future. Since the events which they forecast
are not yet in existence, they obviously cannot portray them
plainly but suggest them obscurely in a manner requiring
interpretation. Thus to dream of fire is a sign of future
anger, to see a great foul mouth in a dream indicates a false
criminal accusation, to dream of a scorpion portends secret
detraction. It is commonly stated by philosophers that the
signification of a dream varies as it occurs at the full moon
or the new moon or in the sunshine, and also according to
the positions of the planets in the signs.<a id="FNanchor_1536" href="#Footnote_1536" class="fnanchor">[1536]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</span></p>
<div class="sidenote">The stars.</div>

<p>From the influence of the stars upon dreams we may
next turn to Vincent’s attitude toward astrology in general.
It is a mixture of passages from church fathers against the
errors of the genethlialogists and <i>mathematici</i>, and of passages
from the philosophers, ancient and recent, affirming
the control of the stars over the world of nature. Vincent,
however, attempts to combine and reconcile these, and makes
his own standpoint fairly evident. He holds that the brief,
vague utterances of Aristotle whence the commentators have
inferred that the stars are alive do not necessarily imply
this.<a id="FNanchor_1537" href="#Footnote_1537" class="fnanchor">[1537]</a> They are nevertheless superior in certain ways to all
inferior life, and are of an unalterable and incorruptible
nature.<a id="FNanchor_1538" href="#Footnote_1538" class="fnanchor">[1538]</a> Vincent undertakes to reconcile the assertion of
holy doctors that the heavens neither have souls nor are
animals with the doctrines of the philosophers.<a id="FNanchor_1539" href="#Footnote_1539" class="fnanchor">[1539]</a> He holds
that there are Intelligences in the spheres of the heavens
who serve the First Cause or Mover and that, although
the saints abhor giving these the name of souls, yet they
concede that intelligences or angels move the heavens and
the stars at the nod of God.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Their
influence.</div>

<p>From sages and men of old Vincent reiterates such doctrine
as that “the movement of the heavens and superior
bodies is the cause of all natural motions” and of generation
and corruption; that there is no plant on earth which does
not have its controlling star; and that “all things which are
renewed in the inferior world, except such as are caused by
the superior form of our reason, have their efficient causes
in the inalterable and incorruptible superior world.”<a id="FNanchor_1540" href="#Footnote_1540" class="fnanchor">[1540]</a> Vincent
devotes much of his sixteenth book to astrological technique,
detailing the good and evil qualities of the planets,
and describing their houses, exaltations, <i>triplicitates</i>,
<i>termini</i>, <i>facies</i>, and their virtues in the different signs of
the zodiac.<a id="FNanchor_1541" href="#Footnote_1541" class="fnanchor">[1541]</a> Like Bartholomew he also reproduces Constantinus
Africanus’ account of the control by the planets
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</span>
of the formation of the human foetus in the womb.<a id="FNanchor_1542" href="#Footnote_1542" class="fnanchor">[1542]</a> In a
later book<a id="FNanchor_1543" href="#Footnote_1543" class="fnanchor">[1543]</a> he repeats the views of Albumasar and an unnamed
astrologer concerning the influence of the sun and
other planets in human generation. Against their control
of such matters as sex, however, Vincent cites the authority
of Augustine and some physiological arguments. He further
warns us not to subject human reason and free will to fatal
necessity of the constellations, citing such authorities as
Gregory’s homily for epiphany and Chrysostom’s sixth
homily on Matthew anent the Magi and the star, and repeating
such time-worn and time-honored arguments as the case
of Esau and Jacob or the fact that in fishless inland provinces
men are born under the sign Pisces.<a id="FNanchor_1544" href="#Footnote_1544" class="fnanchor">[1544]</a> Vincent repeats
the general medieval belief that comets signify pestilence,
famine, or war.<a id="FNanchor_1545" href="#Footnote_1545" class="fnanchor">[1545]</a> His discussion of Egyptian days we have
considered elsewhere. He seems to accept the efficacy of
astrological images, repeating the attribution of medicinal
virtue and influence on human character to “stones on which
you find engraved Aries or Leo or Sagittarius,”<a id="FNanchor_1546" href="#Footnote_1546" class="fnanchor">[1546]</a> and citing
Thetel,<a id="FNanchor_1547" href="#Footnote_1547" class="fnanchor">[1547]</a> perhaps indirectly through Thomas of Cantimpré,
concerning the virtues of engraved gems. But to the virtues
of gems let us turn.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Virtues
of gems.</div>

<p>For the virtues of gems Vincent combines authorities
from the Pseudo-Aristotle and Pliny down to Arnold of
Saxony and Thomas of Cantimpré. The extreme powers
credited to gems by the Magi and Marbod play a prominent
part in his ninth book. Selecting by lot five<a id="FNanchor_1548" href="#Footnote_1548" class="fnanchor">[1548]</a> out of seventy
odd chapters we read that the agate averts storms and
thunderbolts, gives victory in war, routs venomous animals,
aids the sight, slakes the thirst, and promotes fidelity. The
<i>balagius</i> stimulates conjugal affection, burns the right hand
grasping it, strengthens weak eyes if one drinks water in
which it has lain, and protects one against enemies. Coral
checks hemorrhage, reduces corpulence, draws harmful
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</span>
humors from the eye, cures ulcers, and benefits heart, intestines,
and spleen. Suspended over the mouth it stops
stomachache; suspended from the neck it prevents epileptic
fits. Suspended from trees or sown with seed it protects
the fruit or crops from hail storms. Decayed teeth are
filled with it in order to extract them, and it is terrible to
demons because it is so often found in the form of the
cross. The gem heliotrope makes one invincible in battle
and invisible, if it is combined with the herb of the same
name and certain incantations. It makes water boil, reddens
the sun, prevents loss of blood, is an antidote to
poison, assures its bearer long life, and aids in prediction
of the future.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A chapter
on the
jasper.</div>

<p>The chapter on the jasper is a good example of Vincent’s
method of combining excerpts from varied authors.
First he cites the monkish chronicler Helinandus who died
in 1227 to the effect that the jasper worn chastely dispels
fever and dropsy, and that application of it aids child-birth.
The <i>Lapidary</i> of the pseudo-Aristotle repeats this last assertion
and adds that the gem clarifies the human sight and
checks bleeding. Arnold says it makes a man safe and drives
away phantasms, resists luxury, prevents conception, and
checks the flow of blood or the menstrual discharge. From
Pliny we learn that magicians use it in public assemblies.
Philosopher affirms that it renders its wearer chaste, safe,
and agreeable, if it has been consecrated, and that it dispels
noxious phantasms. Thetel is cited concerning the potency
of a jasper found inscribed with a man having a shield about
his neck or in one hand, a spear in the other, and a snake
underfoot. When the image on the gem is that of a man
with a bundle of herbs about his neck, the stone should be
set in silver and it will possess the virtue of distinguishing
between diseases and checking bleeding. Galen is said to
have worn this stone on his finger, and Rabanus says that
it drives away idle fears. Thus the same properties of the
gem are repeated over and over from the mouths of various
authorities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Alchemy.</div>

<p>Before treating of gems in his ninth book Vincent had
discussed other minerals and metals in the eighth. There
he often alludes to alchemy,<a id="FNanchor_1549" href="#Footnote_1549" class="fnanchor">[1549]</a> which he regards as a practical
art related to the science of mineralogy as agriculture is to
botany. He also believes that “by the art of alchemy mineral
bodies are transmuted from their own species into
others, especially metals.”<a id="FNanchor_1550" href="#Footnote_1550" class="fnanchor">[1550]</a> It is true that the fourth book
of the <i>Meteorology</i> of Aristotle contains the statement that
artificers cannot alter species but can only make other metals
seem like silver or gold. But some say that this passage is
not Aristotle’s but an addition from some other author.
Avicenna in the alchemical treatise <i>De anima</i><a id="FNanchor_1551" href="#Footnote_1551" class="fnanchor">[1551]</a> represents
Aristotle and Plato as favorable to alchemy. So Vincent
persists in maintaining that, “while the aforesaid words
make alchemy seem false in a way, yet it has been proved
true both by the ancient philosophers and the artificers of
our time,” and that “transmutation, or rather disintegration”
of metals is truly effected through alchemy. The
baser metals may be reduced to their simplest form and then
reformed into more precious metals.<a id="FNanchor_1552" href="#Footnote_1552" class="fnanchor">[1552]</a> Vincent also devotes
some chapters to “the stone, elixir, by which art imitates
nature.”<a id="FNanchor_1553" href="#Footnote_1553" class="fnanchor">[1553]</a> Avicenna and an unnamed Alchemist seem to
be Vincent’s two chief authorities on the subject of alchemy
in the <i>Speculum naturale</i>. In the <i>Speculum doctrinale</i><a id="FNanchor_1554" href="#Footnote_1554" class="fnanchor">[1554]</a> he
again discussed the subject, this time quoting liberally from
a treatise <i>De aluminibus et salibus</i> attributed to Rasis. A
separate treatise seems to have been formed from these
chapters of Vincent.<a id="FNanchor_1555" href="#Footnote_1555" class="fnanchor">[1555]</a> Vincent’s discussion of alchemy has
already been reviewed by Berthelot<a id="FNanchor_1556" href="#Footnote_1556" class="fnanchor">[1556]</a> who noted the theories
that everything has an occult quality opposed to its natural
one; that four spirits, mercury, sulphur, arsenic, and sal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</span>
ammoniac, and six metals, gold, silver, copper, tin, lead, and
iron, are generated in the bowels of the earth; and that the
metals are generated by mercury and sulphur. The last
doctrine in its developed form Berthelot regarded as not
earlier than the twelfth century. Berthelot was unable to
identify the “Alchemist” cited by Vincent. One can hardly
accept Berthelot’s hypothesis that a work which contains
ideas not found in the <i>Speculum naturale</i> is later than the
thirteenth century. The <i>Speculum naturale</i> was written, if
not by 1250, at least many years before the close of the
century, and, voluminous as are its extracts, it is very far
from being all-inclusive of the ideas of the time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Virtues
of plants.</div>

<p>Like Pliny, Vincent devotes much more space to the
vegetable than to the mineral kingdom.<a id="FNanchor_1557" href="#Footnote_1557" class="fnanchor">[1557]</a> But the virtues
ascribed to plants are much less marvelous than those credited
to stones, and the methods of making use of them are seldom
superstitious. In this we have, of course, not merely Vincent’s
attitude; he reflects his sources and conforms to the
usual medieval position. The virtues ascribed to plants are
mainly medicinal; many are doubtless false, however, and
Vincent, with his voluminous extracts and citations, magnifies
the customary ancient and medieval tendency to make
each herb a cure for a long list of very miscellaneous and
unrelated ailments. Cinnamon and pepper,<a id="FNanchor_1558" href="#Footnote_1558" class="fnanchor">[1558]</a> for example,
he appears to regard as panaceas, an interesting side-light on
medieval fondness for spices. A fair sample of his ordinary
treatment is provided by the chapter on the herb
<i>Cameleon</i> or <i>Camelea</i>. Pliny says that it purges the stomach
and removes phlegm and bile. Ulcers are purged by cooking
its leaves in two parts of wormwood and drinking them
with syrup of honey, at the same time making a poultice
of the leaves. They say that if anyone plucks it before
sunrise and states that he takes it for white growths of
the eyes, the ailment will be removed by its application. Indeed,
gathered in any way it is wholesome for the eyes of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</span>
the young. Dioscorides says that it removes phlegm and
makes a healing poultice for foul wounds. Avicenna holds
that it should be used only in external applications, where it
has cleansing, soothing, and softening properties. It is
beneficial for morphea, scab, ringworm, and corrosive ulcers.
By this point the citation from Avicenna must have terminated,
since we are informed that the roots of the white
variety taken in wine as a drink help a patient suffering
from dropsy. These roots of the white variety also kill
worms, while the black kind kills any venomous creature.
Vincent then cites the <i>Herbarium</i>, presumably of the pseudo-Apuleius,
to the effect that the <i>Cameleon</i> has the force of
tyriac or theriac, that a decoction of it solves difficulty in
urinating and cures intestinal worms and dropsy.<a id="FNanchor_1559" href="#Footnote_1559" class="fnanchor">[1559]</a> Besides
the authors cited in the foregoing chapter Vincent makes
use on the subject of vegetation of such writers as Solinus,
Isidore, the <i>Hexaemeron</i> of Ambrose, the work of Isaac
on diet, Platearius, and Constantinus Africanus. He apparently
does not use Galen’s work on medicinal simples directly.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Animals.</div>

<p>Vincent discusses animals at even greater length than
vegetation, devoting a book each to birds, fish, and snakes;
two to quadrupeds; others to animal life and processes in
general; and still others to human physiology and psychology.
Again we encounter the marvelous virtues, medicinal
and otherwise, inherent in parts of animals, and amusing
accounts of their ways and instinctive sagacity. The eagle
places certain stones in its nest to counteract its own excessive
heat in the hatching process; the bird called “goat-milker”
steals milk from goats’ udders by night; the cormorant
dips its head beneath the wave to collect signs of the
weather and flies shoreward clamorously, if it detects a
storm approaching; the parrot bites rocks and drinks wine.<a id="FNanchor_1560" href="#Footnote_1560" class="fnanchor">[1560]</a>
Pope Alexander had a cloak made of the wool of salamanders
which, whenever it became soiled, was cleansed by
casting it into the flames instead of washing it in water.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</span><a id="FNanchor_1561" href="#Footnote_1561" class="fnanchor">[1561]</a>
Vincent borrows his statements of the virtues of animals
and their parts to a large extent from Pliny, whose contents
we have earlier sufficiently presented. The medicinal virtues
of the human body and its different parts are also set forth
in much the usual fashion. Vincent’s considerable number
of citations from Physiologus are, like Bartholomew’s,
difficult to identify with those of any existing Bestiary.
Some seem connected with Scriptural Glosses. It is remarkable
that while he cites Physiologus a good deal concerning
birds and serpents,<a id="FNanchor_1562" href="#Footnote_1562" class="fnanchor">[1562]</a> in the book on quadrupeds he does not
cite Physiologus for the lion, <i>onager</i>, and other such animals
as figure prominently in the so-called Physiologus and
Bestiaries.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The tree
of life
and the
bodies
of the
damned.</div>

<p>In the thirty-first book on paradise and the fall of man
Vincent quotes Peter Comestor who, unlike Philo Judaeus,
believes in the actual existence of both the tree of life and
the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. He states that
the tree of life was so called from its natural effect, which
was so to strengthen in perpetual solidity the body of him
who ate of it that he would suffer no infirmity, anxiety, or
old age.<a id="FNanchor_1563" href="#Footnote_1563" class="fnanchor">[1563]</a> Thus Vincent encourages belief not only in transmutation
of metals but some natural method of maintaining
perpetual youth and health. In the <i>Mirror of History</i> he
quotes “the sayings of a certain simple and good man,” to
whom, among other revelations concerning the end of the
world, the information had been vouchsafed that the torments
of the damned would largely consist in the removal
from their bodies of all the good qualities which now temper
the contrariety of the bad, which would thus be left to vex
them unopposed and unassuaged.<a id="FNanchor_1564" href="#Footnote_1564" class="fnanchor">[1564]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Who
sinned the
more,
Adam or
Eve?</div>

<p>Vincent ventures on some amusing theological speculation
of his own in discussing the interesting question whether
Adam or Eve sinned more in eating the apple.<a id="FNanchor_1565" href="#Footnote_1565" class="fnanchor">[1565]</a> As might
be expected of a medieval man and clergyman, he decides
against the woman. Eve sinned in four respects and Adam
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</span>
in only two. First she sinned in doubting the divine warning;
second, in wishing to steal divinity for herself; third,
in eating contrary to the prohibition; fourth, in tempting
man to eat. Adam was not seduced into thinking that he
could become divine by this method, but was led astray by
a certain amiable good-will, fearing to offend his wife if
he did not eat the apple which she offered him. Thus Eve’s
intention in sinning was the worse and woman has been
punished for it the more severely. Yet Adam sinned in
two respects, namely, in secret pride and in eating what had
been forbidden. Another reason why Eve was the greater
sinner was that she sinned against more persons; against
God, against herself, and against her neighbor. But in
one respect Adam’s sin was the graver; he knew better,
while Eve sinned in a certain measure from ignorance and
feminine incapacity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Classification
of the
sciences.</div>

<p>We may also note Vincent’s classification of the sciences.
As he adopted the common Christian division of the world’s
history into six ages, as in the <i>Speculum naturale</i> he followed
the order of the six days of creation, so in the third <i>Mirror
of Doctrine</i> he made six fields of knowledge; literary, moral,
mechanical, physical, mathematical, and theological.<a id="FNanchor_1566" href="#Footnote_1566" class="fnanchor">[1566]</a> This
suggests Roger Bacon’s selection of the five most essential
subjects leading up to the study of theology, namely, the
languages, mathematics, perspective or optics, experimental
or applied science, and moral philosophy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Concluding
estimate
of the
<i>Speculum
naturale</i>.</div>

<p>Such is the <i>Speculum maius</i> or more particularly the
<i>Speculum naturale</i>, a work impressive by its very voluminousness
and multitude of citations of authorities, valuable
as a work of reference, a great storehouse of medieval lore,
providing somewhat the same retrospect upon previous
medieval and Latin science as Pliny’s <i>Natural History</i>
afforded for Hellenistic science. We can, however, recover
more of its sources than in the case of Pliny; and when we
have read them, Vincent’s excerpts from them drop to a
secondary place in our esteem. We see how much of his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</span>
work had been done for him by previous compilers like
Bartholomew of England and Thomas of Cantimpré, and
how large a portion of his work is a repetition of Pliny
himself. Vincent’s volumes suggest the use of scissors and
paste a little too manifestly. On the other hand, his work
does not include everything that is in previous medieval
writers on nature, to say nothing of others that were to
come after him, and the assumption made even by specialists
in the study of medieval culture, like Rose, Berthelot, and
Mâle, that the <i>Speculum naturale</i> alone is an adequate reflection
of medieval natural science and that Vincent is sure
to mention any previous writer or treatise,&mdash;this assumption
is far from true. His <i>Mirror</i> is a glass through which we

translation of the two books

if Vincent’s failure to cite
a work by Albertus Magnus can
be taken as sure proof that the
work had not yet been written.
Vincent was far from noting or
including everything that was
known in his time or had been
written before, although some lazy
investigators of the past have
seen fit to assume that his work
adequately depicted the entirety
of medieval natural science.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Representatives
of
thirteenth
century
medicine.</div>

<p>Medical writers of the thirteenth and early fourteenth century
are so numerous and their writings so similar, that it
will be advisable to treat of only two or three of them as
examples of the rest. At the close of the thirteenth century
Peter of Abano and Arnald of Villanova were such important
personalities and so addicted, the one to astrology,
and the other to occult science, that we must devote an entire
chapter to each. Of the writers before them it will perhaps
be sufficient if we consider in some detail, first Gilbert of
England, who seems to have flourished in the first half of
the thirteenth century and who was much cited by the later
medical writers; next, a brief but significant work in astrological
medicine composed in 1219 by a William of England
(or of Aragon?); and finally in a second chapter Petrus
Hispanus, who terminated his brilliant career in 1277 as
Pope John XXI, and to whose account of “the way of
experience” we shall add briefly something concerning the
similar discussion of medical experiment in John of St.
Amand who seems to have written between 1262 and 1280.<a id="FNanchor_1567" href="#Footnote_1567" class="fnanchor">[1567]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Question
of Gilbert’s
date.</div>

<p>It seems certain from the citation of Gilbert by Petrus
Hispanus and other writers&mdash;possibly by Bartholomew of
England&mdash;that he must have written rather early in the thirteenth
century.<a id="FNanchor_1568" href="#Footnote_1568" class="fnanchor">[1568]</a> Haeser,<a id="FNanchor_1569" href="#Footnote_1569" class="fnanchor">[1569]</a> who dated him about 1290, and
Freind, who dated him about 1270, are both certainly wrong.
But his date has not yet been fixed with exactness, and it
is doubted whether he was physician to Hubert Walter who
died in 1205, as Bale, Pits, and Leland tell us. It is also
disputed whether a Master Richard whom he cites was
Richard of Salerno, who flourished at the close of the twelfth
century, or Richard of Wendover and Paris, who was physician
to Pope Gregory IX (1227-1241) and died himself in
1252 or 1256. Because our Gilbert cites Averroes it has
been argued<a id="FNanchor_1570" href="#Footnote_1570" class="fnanchor">[1570]</a> that he did not flourish until the middle of
the thirteenth century but Michael Scot had translated Averroes’
commentary on the metaphysics of Aristotle early
in the century.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Works
ascribed
to Gilbert.</div>

<p>A manuscript in the Bibliothèque Nationale at Paris
contains <i>Experiments of Master Gilbert, Chancellor of Montpellier</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1571" href="#Footnote_1571" class="fnanchor">[1571]</a>
and there was a chancellor of that university named
<i>Gillibertus</i> in 1250. It remains uncertain, however, whether
he was the same as Gilbert of England, and whether the
<i>Experiments</i> are by Gilbert of England or perhaps a later
compilation made partly from his <i>Compendium</i> and partly
from other sources. The <i>Dictionary of National Biography</i>
describes the <i>Experiments</i> as “a collection of receipts, many
of which bear Gilbert’s name and are certainly his, for they
agree closely with passages in his <i>Compendium</i> without
being identical.” If “Experiments of a Chancellor and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</span>
Cardinal” in a manuscript at Madrid<a id="FNanchor_1572" href="#Footnote_1572" class="fnanchor">[1572]</a> were the same work,
there would be reason for thinking that Gilbert of England
became a cardinal. “A secret of Gilbert the cardinal” is
contained in an alchemistic manuscript of the fifteenth century
at Cambridge.<a id="FNanchor_1573" href="#Footnote_1573" class="fnanchor">[1573]</a> We also hear of a Gilbertus Anglicus
who was a great theologian and wrote a commentary upon
the oracle of Cyril the Carmelite.<a id="FNanchor_1574" href="#Footnote_1574" class="fnanchor">[1574]</a> It would not be strange
to have in the course of a century or two more than one
writer from England named Gilbert. But it also at that
time would not be strange to have the same man write on
medicine and theology, and such a man is just the one who
might be expected to fill both the posts of chancellor at
Montpellier and cardinal at the papal court. We shall see
that Peter of Spain wrote on logic as well as medicine and
became pope. But to note one or two other treatises that
have been ascribed to Gilbert of England. An <i>Antidotarium</i>
which is ascribed to him in a thirteenth century manuscript<a id="FNanchor_1575" href="#Footnote_1575" class="fnanchor">[1575]</a>
is perhaps a portion of the <i>Compendium</i>, but the
commentary of Gilbert on the <i>Verses of Giles concerning
Urines</i> was an independent and well-known work.<a id="FNanchor_1576" href="#Footnote_1576" class="fnanchor">[1576]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The <i>Compendium
medicinae</i>.</div>

<p>Gilbert’s chief work, and the one which we shall discuss,
is the <i>Compendium medicinae</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1577" href="#Footnote_1577" class="fnanchor">[1577]</a> a medical compilation in
seven books. Its quotations from the <i>Surgery</i> (<i>Chirurgia</i>)
of Roger of Parma inclined Dr. Handerson to date it about
1240 and not before 1230.<a id="FNanchor_1578" href="#Footnote_1578" class="fnanchor">[1578]</a> It seems to have set the style
for such works as the <i>Lilium medicinae</i> of Bernard Gordon
and the <i>Rosa medicinae</i> of John of Gaddesden.<a id="FNanchor_1579" href="#Footnote_1579" class="fnanchor">[1579]</a> The first
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</span>
book deals with fevers, the second begins with the hair,
the third treats of diseases of the eyes, the fourth of ills
of the neck and throat, the fifth discusses the appetite, the
sixth the liver, and the seventh the private parts. The seven
books of Gordon’s <i>Lilium</i> cover the same ground respectively,
except that Gordon omits the surgical passages which
Gilbert incorporated in his work.<a id="FNanchor_1580" href="#Footnote_1580" class="fnanchor">[1580]</a> E. Littré in the <i>Histoire
Littéraire</i> has described Gilbert’s work as “abounding in
superstitious or ridiculous or childish formulas.” To these
Gilbert often adds such expressions as “This has been
proved,” or copies the accounts in his authorities even to
such phrases as “in our presence.” But we have already
seen this to be the practice in the far-off days of Aëtius
of Amida. Gilbert also often calls this or that assertion
false, but here again the scepticism probably does not always
originate with him. His work is of course professedly a
compilation. Gilbert nevertheless seems at times to speak
from his own experience and medical practice.</p>

<div class="sidenote">General
character
of his
medicine.</div>

<p>If one were to attempt a brief general characterization
of Gilbert’s medicine, it would be that he combines Aristotelian
principles and reasoning, and the hypothesis of four
elements and four qualities, with a practical regimen of
bathing, diet, bleeding, plasters, rubbing with ointments,
and the like&mdash;which is perhaps largely Salernitan. His procedure
is vitiated by a large residuum from early magic as
well as by incorrect scientific hypotheses handed down from
the Greek philosophers. His pharmacy, however, makes
more use of herbs than of gems or of parts of animals.
But his recipes are legion and many of them include an
absurdly large number of ingredients. He also discusses
the signs of diseases, their course and character, and the
processes of the human body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">An estimate
of
it by a
modern
physician.</div>

<p>Since I wrote the preceding paragraph, a rather detailed
presentation of the contents of Gilbert’s <i>Compendium</i> has
fortunately been published in English from the pen of one
better fitted than I to judge its medical defects and merits.
Dr. Handerson’s eminently sane conclusions may be briefly
indicated by two quotations. “It is not difficult, of course,
to select from the Compendium a charm or two, a few impossible
etymologies and a few silly statements, to display
these with a witty emphasis and to draw therefrom the easy
conclusion that the book is a mass of crass superstition and
absurd nonsense. This, however, is not criticism. It is
mere caricature.”<a id="FNanchor_1581" href="#Footnote_1581" class="fnanchor">[1581]</a> “The book is, undoubtedly, the work
of a famous and strictly orthodox physician, possessed of
exceptional education in the science of his day, a man of
wide reading, broadened by extensive travel and endowed
by the knowledge acquired by a long experience, honest,
truthful, and simple minded, yet not uncritical in regard to
novelties, firm in his own opinions but not arrogant, sympathetic,
possessed of a high sense of professional honor, a
firm believer in authority and therefore credulous, superstitious
after the manner of his age, yet harboring, too, a
germ of ... healthy scepticism.”<a id="FNanchor_1582" href="#Footnote_1582" class="fnanchor">[1582]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Picturesque
compounds.</div>

<p>Some of Gilbert’s over-elaborate compounds possess
picturesque names as well, for instance, the potion of St.
Paul and the ladder of Hermes.<a id="FNanchor_1583" href="#Footnote_1583" class="fnanchor">[1583]</a> The latter was composed
at Heliopolis on the altar of the sun and written not in letters
but figures. It consists of sixty different simples and
is called a ladder because the amount of these simples used
in the compound is increased step by step. First one takes
one ounce each of four simples, then two ounces each of
four more, and so on for four species at a time, until the
quantity of fifteen ounces is reached and the list of sixty
simples is exhausted. This compound is asserted to be
beneficial for rather more than fifteen ailments.<a id="FNanchor_1584" href="#Footnote_1584" class="fnanchor">[1584]</a> Gilbert
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</span>
employs various Salernitan pills and they usually contain
from ten to twenty ingredients each.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Empirica</i>
and an
old-wife’s
remedy.</div>

<p>When other remedies fail Gilbert has recourse, like
Marcellus, to <i>empirica</i>. One by which many “under our
charge” (<i>in manu nostra</i>) who were thought sterile have
borne children is as follows.<a id="FNanchor_1585" href="#Footnote_1585" class="fnanchor">[1585]</a> In the vigil of St. John the
Baptist<a id="FNanchor_1586" href="#Footnote_1586" class="fnanchor">[1586]</a> dig certain herbs by the roots from the earth before
the third hour, repeating the Lord’s Prayer thrice and not
speaking to anyone going or returning. In silence, too, extract
the juice from the herbs and write on a piece of parchment
these words, “The Lord said, ‘Increase’ x Uthiboth x
‘and multiply’ x thabechay x ‘and fill the earth’ x amath x.”
If the man wears this writing about his neck, a boy will be
born; if the woman wears it, a girl. Other <i>empirica</i> employ
suffumigations with a tooth of a dead man and an herb
that has grown through a hole in a stone. In another passage
to aid child-bearing Gilbert recommends the water in
which a murderer has washed his hands.<a id="FNanchor_1587" href="#Footnote_1587" class="fnanchor">[1587]</a> He repeats the
good old remedies for gout of binding frogs’ legs or asses’
hoofs or tortoises’ feet upon the patient’s extremities, right
on right and left on left, but cites therefor the mysterious
authority “Torror,” while “Funeius” is his source for the
use of the magnet in the same way. Gilbert states, however,
that he has little inclination towards these things, but that
it is just as well not to omit what the ancients have said.<a id="FNanchor_1588" href="#Footnote_1588" class="fnanchor">[1588]</a>
In another passage he tells that a certain old woman has
freed many persons from jaundice with the cooked juice of
the plantagenet.<a id="FNanchor_1589" href="#Footnote_1589" class="fnanchor">[1589]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Use of red
for small-pox:
occult
virtue.</div>

<p>Gilbert is credited with being the first to mention the
employment of red colors in the treatment of small-pox.<a id="FNanchor_1590" href="#Footnote_1590" class="fnanchor">[1590]</a>
It is interesting to note that the passage in which he does
this has to do also with the practices of old-wives and with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</span>
the conception of occult virtue. He writes, “Old women of
the countryside give burnt purple in drink, for it has the
occult nature of curing <i>variolae</i>. The same is true of dyed
cloths.”<a id="FNanchor_1591" href="#Footnote_1591" class="fnanchor">[1591]</a> Here again therefore we seem to have a real
discovery developed from or concealed beneath a bit of
experimental magic. John of Gaddesden is said to have
used scarlet cloths to cure a son of Edward I of small-pox.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Magical
treatment
of epilepsy.</div>

<p>The following very magical procedure is used for
epilepsy and is called <i>expertissimum</i>.<a id="FNanchor_1592" href="#Footnote_1592" class="fnanchor">[1592]</a> At the first access
of the disease, when the patient falls to the ground, all his
clothes except his shirt should be removed and placed at
his feet. The nails of all his fingers and toes should next
be clipped and wrapped in a cloth. A long white thorn is
then to be split and the patient dragged feet first through
the cleft as far as his middle. The thorn should then be
cut into small bits and placed with the nail parings. Next
the patient’s hair should be cut in three places. These clippings
of hair and the knife used in the operation are then
to be added to the other paraphernalia wrapped in the cloth,
and the whole is to be buried underground, and the following
words uttered. In the patient’s right ear, “Christ conquers”;
in his left ear, “Christ reigns”; and to his face,
“Christ commands.” Others perform the ceremony differently,
cutting the patient’s shoe latchet into four pieces
and burying them in the form of a cross at his head, feet,
and either hand with some of his nails and hair. And the
names of the three kings&mdash;that is, the Magi who came to
adore Christ&mdash;should be worn about his neck.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Poisons
and snake
oil.</div>

<p>Gilbert’s account of poisons repeats such usual statements
as that the saliva of a fasting man is poison for snakes,<a id="FNanchor_1593" href="#Footnote_1593" class="fnanchor">[1593]</a>
that the viper deposits its venom on a stone by the shore
when entering the water to have commerce with the fish,
and that there was a girl fed on poison who caused the
deaths of kings who loved her and whose saliva killed animals
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</span>
who approached her.<a id="FNanchor_1594" href="#Footnote_1594" class="fnanchor">[1594]</a> Gilbert cites for the last
“Ruffus,” however, and not the <i>Secret of Secrets</i>. A medicinal
unguent is made by cutting off the heads and tails of
snakes, as in Galen’s directions for preparing theriac, and
distilling an oil from them.<a id="FNanchor_1595" href="#Footnote_1595" class="fnanchor">[1595]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Eye cures.</div>

<p>Parts of animals are much employed in corrosives for eye
complaints. Green lizards, all gall, but especially that of
birds of prey, <i>omne stercus</i> but human especially, all salts
but especially nitrates, the inner skin of a hen’s liver, the
blood of a black fly, and many other similar substances are
recommended.<a id="FNanchor_1596" href="#Footnote_1596" class="fnanchor">[1596]</a> For spots in the eyes Gilbert suggests administering
whole in drink the little worms with many feet
which are found between the bark and trunk of trees. “But
they should be taken with the Lord’s Prayer.”<a id="FNanchor_1597" href="#Footnote_1597" class="fnanchor">[1597]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Influence
of the
stars.</div>

<p>Occasionally a passage evinces Gilbert’s belief in the influence
of the stars. He speaks of the participation of the
heavens in the process of human generation<a id="FNanchor_1598" href="#Footnote_1598" class="fnanchor">[1598]</a> and of the influence
of the various planets on the formation of the embryo
in the womb.<a id="FNanchor_1599" href="#Footnote_1599" class="fnanchor">[1599]</a> In arguing that a poisonous compound
multiplies its potency through the union of the species composing
it, and that it “has a stronger action than if it were
simple”<a id="FNanchor_1600" href="#Footnote_1600" class="fnanchor">[1600]</a>&mdash;a passage in which there is a close approach to
our conception of chemical change&mdash;Gilbert adduces the
influence of the heavens as a factor in increasing the strength
of the compound. He holds that the celestial bodies resemble
terrestrial mineral substances in not feeling pain,
but that unlike them they are sentient, sensible, and unchangeable.
They are bodies, but uncorruptible.<a id="FNanchor_1601" href="#Footnote_1601" class="fnanchor">[1601]</a> Arnald
of Villanova<a id="FNanchor_1602" href="#Footnote_1602" class="fnanchor">[1602]</a> at the end of the century cites Gilbert’s warning
in his first book on fevers against bleeding the patient
during dog days or the Egyptian days or when the moon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</span>
is in conjunction with a malevolent planet. Gilbert adds
that the wise doctor will always observe the moon.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The soul,
number,
and geometry;
physiognomy.</div>

<p>In the midst of his discussion of dropsy Gilbert digresses
to treat of the soul, “because ignorance gives birth to shame
and stupidity to poverty.” Some traces of numerical and
geometrical mysticism are seen in his discussion.<a id="FNanchor_1603" href="#Footnote_1603" class="fnanchor">[1603]</a> He represents
Pythagoras as saying that the soul is number moving
itself, and that of its four properties or functions intellect
is like the number one because it comprehends simple matters
and so is compared to a point. Reason is like two
or a line since it comprehends form as it exists in bodies.
Opinion is like four or a surface because it comprehends
form as form. Science is like eight or a cube because it
comprehends form <i>ut est in subiecto</i>. Gilbert further explains
that the three souls assigned to man by Aristotle are
really the triple power of one soul.<a id="FNanchor_1604" href="#Footnote_1604" class="fnanchor">[1604]</a> He compares the
vegetative soul to a triangle, the sensible soul to a square,
and the rational soul to a circle. Gilbert regards the disagreement
between Aristotle and Plato concerning the movement
of the soul as verbal rather than real. “Aristotle discusses
matters truly, essentially, and philosophically; Plato,
figuratively, casually, and mathematically.” Gilbert occasionally
embodies the dicta of the physiognomists in his
<i>Compendium</i>, for instance: “He whose eyes are large and
tremulous is lazy and a braggart and fond of women”; and
“He who has large ears is stolid and long lived.”<a id="FNanchor_1605" href="#Footnote_1605" class="fnanchor">[1605]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Astrological
medicine
in
William of
England’s
<i>De urina
non visa</i>.</div>

<p>Because perhaps of Gilbert’s commentary upon the verses
of Giles concerning urines, a Master G. of England who is
the author of “a book in which he tells how to know the
character of the urine without inspecting it and many other
things by means of astrology,” in a Vienna manuscript is
called in the catalogue Gilbertus instead of Guilelmus
Anglicus.<a id="FNanchor_1606" href="#Footnote_1606" class="fnanchor">[1606]</a> As many other manuscripts<a id="FNanchor_1607" href="#Footnote_1607" class="fnanchor">[1607]</a> of the treatise
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</span>
show, the work is really the <i>Of Urine Unseen</i> written in
1219 by William of England, a citizen of Marseilles, by profession
a medical man, by merit of science an astronomer,
as he himself states. Indeed, there are extant other astronomical
works by him, one of which is dated 1231.<a id="FNanchor_1608" href="#Footnote_1608" class="fnanchor">[1608]</a>
The object of the brief treatise is how to tell the nature of
the patient’s disease and the outcome of it from the stars
and signs of the zodiac without inspection of the patient’s
urine. The nine chapters deal with (1) “the quadruple way
of astrological speculation,” that is, nativities, revolutions,
interrogations, and elections; (2) “the comprehension of
the effects of superior bodies” on the human body for each
sign of the zodiac and the use of astrology in medicine; (3)
the division of the human body among the planets and their
natures and properties with the diseases appropriate to them;
(4) the houses of the planets; (5) the distribution of the
parts of the body among the planets and signs with an accompanying
chart of eighty-four squares arranged in seven columns
and twelve rows; (6) how to arrive at a judgment in
any particular case by finding the ruling planet;<a id="FNanchor_1609" href="#Footnote_1609" class="fnanchor">[1609]</a> (7) “of
the place of the liver and its significator and the virtues of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</span>
the same”; (8) of the color and substance of the urine;
(9) of the outcome of the sickness and its end. William
mentions in closing a case where he correctly predicted that
the patient would die in exactly two months and eight days.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Other
works by
William of
England or
by other
Williams.</div>

<p>We have already alluded elsewhere<a id="FNanchor_1610" href="#Footnote_1610" class="fnanchor">[1610]</a> to “the very great
secret of Catenus, king of the Persians, concerning the virtue
of the eagle” which William of England is credited with
having translated from the Arabic. And we have suggested
that a William of Aragon who commented upon the <i>Centiloquium</i>
ascribed to Ptolemy and wrote a treatise on the
interpretation of dreams might possibly have been the same
man.<a id="FNanchor_1611" href="#Footnote_1611" class="fnanchor">[1611]</a> We also hear of a “William, master of medicine, of
Provençal nationality,” who translated from Greek into
Latin the life of the philosopher Secundus, which work he
brought with him from Constantinople. Afterwards, we
are told, this William became a monk of St. Denis and
finally the abbot of that monastery. Secundus is described
as a philosopher who observed the rule of silence and led
the life of a Pythagorean, and who was associated with the
emperor Hadrian.<a id="FNanchor_1612" href="#Footnote_1612" class="fnanchor">[1612]</a> He appears to have broken his silence
enough to give forth <i>Sententiae</i> which were treasured up
by that emperor.<a id="FNanchor_1613" href="#Footnote_1613" class="fnanchor">[1613]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Nationality:
at
Paris.</div>

<p>Petrus Hispanus, or Peter of Spain, who finally became
Pope John XXI, is said by Ptolemy of Lucca, who died
fifty years after him in 1327, to have been of Portuguese
nationality.<a id="FNanchor_1614" href="#Footnote_1614" class="fnanchor">[1614]</a> His birth is placed at Lisbon between 1210
and 1220, and he is said to have been the son of a physician
named Julian.<a id="FNanchor_1615" href="#Footnote_1615" class="fnanchor">[1615]</a> However, in the preface to his <i>De conservanda
sanitate</i>, as preserved in a fifteenth century manuscript,
Peter speaks of himself as from Compostella and as
familiar with all Italy, Burgundy, Gascony, and parts of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</span>
Spain.<a id="FNanchor_1616" href="#Footnote_1616" class="fnanchor">[1616]</a> In other manuscripts he calls himself Petrus Hispanus.
He came to the University of Paris at an early age,
as he himself testified when pope in a letter to the bishop of
Paris.<a id="FNanchor_1617" href="#Footnote_1617" class="fnanchor">[1617]</a> In the same epistle he refers to the many years he
spent at Paris occupied with varied studies. His text-book
in logic was universally adopted and often commented upon,
and has now been shown to be, not, as Prantl held in his
<i>History of Logic</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1618" href="#Footnote_1618" class="fnanchor">[1618]</a> a copy of the work of Psellus, but an
independent product of the Parisian school. It was printed
from forty to fifty times between 1477 and 1519.<a id="FNanchor_1619" href="#Footnote_1619" class="fnanchor">[1619]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Medical
works and
later life.</div>

<p>From 1246 to 1250 Peter was at Siena in the faculty
of arts. Perhaps he then wrote the letter to the emperor,
Frederick II, <i>On the Rule of Health</i>, if it be a genuine work,
which precedes his <i>Thesaurus pauperum</i> in at least one
manuscript.<a id="FNanchor_1620" href="#Footnote_1620" class="fnanchor">[1620]</a> Ptolemy of Lucca calls Peter “an all-round
scholar and specialist in medicine,”<a id="FNanchor_1621" href="#Footnote_1621" class="fnanchor">[1621]</a> and mentions particularly
among his medical works the famous <i>Thesaurus
pauperum</i>, which we shall presently consider as a very influential
and representative handbook of medieval medicine.
In all seventeen medical works are attributed to Peter, of
which only three have been printed.<a id="FNanchor_1622" href="#Footnote_1622" class="fnanchor">[1622]</a> At the beginning of
his treatise on eye diseases Peter speaks of himself as a
professor of the art of medicine and an investigator of
the truth.<a id="FNanchor_1623" href="#Footnote_1623" class="fnanchor">[1623]</a> In the <i>Thesaurus pauperum</i> he cites Albertus
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</span>
Magnus as well as Gilbertus Anglicus, but he probably
did not write it very late in life. Pope Gregory X made
Peter a cardinal in 1273,<a id="FNanchor_1624" href="#Footnote_1624" class="fnanchor">[1624]</a> he was also an archbishop, and
in 1276 the career of the celebrated scholar culminated in
his election to the papal see following Gregory’s death.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Death and
character.</div>

<p>The next year Peter met an untimely death from the
fall of a ceiling, a catastrophe which according to the gossip
of Ptolemy of Lucca occurred while he was engaged in a
fit of complacent and self-admiring laughter and shortly
after he had issued some fulminations against the monks,
for whom he had little love. Ptolemy criticizes the pope
as not dignified enough in speech and manner for his office,
but concedes that he was easily approached and very kindly
to all scholars and men of letters. Millot-Carpentier regarded
him as “assuredly one of the most illustrious personages
of the thirteenth century both as a philosopher and as
a dialectician,” and as “a true scholar and worthy representative
of the University of Paris, ... having all the
faults of his time but endowed with a liberal spirit.”<a id="FNanchor_1625" href="#Footnote_1625" class="fnanchor">[1625]</a> Millot-Carpentier
also gives a list of ecclesiastical offices, honors,
and dignities held by other physicians of the period in addition
to the supreme honor of a papal election which Peter
attained.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
<i>Thesaurus
pauperum</i>.</div>

<p>Peter’s book, the <i>Thesaurus pauperum</i>, became perhaps
the leading brief medical manual during the remainder of
the middle ages, as the numerous extant manuscripts and
many printed editions bear witness.<a id="FNanchor_1626" href="#Footnote_1626" class="fnanchor">[1626]</a> It was translated into
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</span>
Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, and English. The work was
intended to be a condensed compilation and its title, “The
Treasure of the Poor,” indicates that it was written especially
for the benefit of poor students and medical practitioners,
who could not afford many books. It thus continues
the type of book represented by Galen’s <i>Euporista</i> and by
the compendiums of post-classical medicine, and is to be
regarded, like Bartholomew of England’s “On the Properties
of Things,” as an example of a medieval text-book
and not as a specialized work.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Is it interpolated?</div>

<p>Stapper states in his Life of Pope John XXI<a id="FNanchor_1627" href="#Footnote_1627" class="fnanchor">[1627]</a> that the
text of the <i>Thesaurus pauperum</i> has suffered greatly from
later interpolations, that every successive transcriber of the
manuscript felt at liberty to add any further recipes of
past authors that hit his fancy, and that thereby a great deal
of superstitious nonsense for which the pope should not
be held accountable was added to the original work. But
on what authority or from what personal inspection of
manuscripts Stapper makes this assertion is not clear. He
lists, it is true, a number of manuscripts in continental
libraries and a few at Oxford, but his citations of the
<i>Thesaurus pauperum</i> are all from the Lyons edition of 1525.
It is also true that he affirms that he has searched the manuscripts
in vain for the sentence in the preface of the printed
text in which it is stated that ligatures are not superstitious.
But I have found the passage without much search in three
manuscripts of one library.<a id="FNanchor_1628" href="#Footnote_1628" class="fnanchor">[1628]</a> Possibly one reason why Stapper
failed to find it is that the opening word of the sentence
is not <i>Litteras</i>, which he gives presumably from the 1525
edition, and which would mean “characters” if it could
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</span>
mean anything in the context in question, but <i>Ligaturas</i>,
as the 1497 edition correctly has it.<a id="FNanchor_1629" href="#Footnote_1629" class="fnanchor">[1629]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Essential
character
of the
work
fairly represented
even by
the
printed
version.</div>

<p>My own feeling is rather that the book, even in the
printed editions of 1497 and 1578 which I had access to, is
not more superstitious than one would expect a compilation
of ancient, Arabic, and medieval medicine to be. The 1497
edition, it is true, confesses to a number of additions from
a Peter of Tuscany (? <i>de tusciano</i>) and from Bernard
Gordon; but it gives these additions separately at the close
of various chapters. I have also inspected a number of
manuscripts of the work at the British Museum, none of
which Stapper mentions in his list, and which date from the
fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. It is not easy to compare
these different copies or versions, since they vary greatly in
headings and arrangement, so that the same statement may
be found in different places in them. But there seem to
be passages in the 1497 edition which are not in the manuscripts,
and these in turn, as is usually the case, are not all
alike in contents.<a id="FNanchor_1630" href="#Footnote_1630" class="fnanchor">[1630]</a> But while there may be considerable
interpolation, it does not seem to have essentially altered the
original character of the book. The superstitious nonsense
may have increased in amount but scarcely in degree. Much
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</span>
the same sort of remedies may be found in the earliest
manuscript and latest printed text. To be on the safe side,
however, in the ensuing account of the <i>Thesaurus pauperum</i>
I shall follow the manuscripts rather than the printed text.
I shall then add some account of other treatises which I have
found ascribed to Peter in the manuscripts and of his printed
Commentaries on Isaac’s <i>Diets</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Devout
tone of its
preface.</div>

<p>The brief preface, which appears in most of the manuscripts
that I have seen as well as in the printed editions,
gives a good idea of the nature of the work. Its opening
sentence reflects the religious spirit of the age and status
of the author. “In the name of the holy and indissoluble
Trinity, who created all things which are not God and who
endowed individual objects with their particular virtues,
from whom all wisdom is given to the wise and science to
scientists, I approach a task beyond my powers trusting in
the aid of the same, who works through us as instruments
all good works.” In a second sentence, given differently in
the manuscripts and printed texts, the author states the title
of his work, <i>Thesaurus pauperum</i>. Later he adds that the
attentive reader will find here easy and efficacious medicines
for almost all infirmities, provided he has Him as helper
who created medicine from earth. He also warns the physician,
lest by his science he impugn God the giver of science,
to take the utmost care not to reveal to anyone any medicines
by which pregnancy may be prevented or abortions provoked.
In most manuscripts that I have examined the
preface presently concludes with the sentence, “Therefore
in the name of Jesus Christ, the supreme physician, who
heals at His will all our infirmities, since He is the head of
the faithful, let us begin with diseases of the head and descend
to the feet.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Arrangement
of
the text.</div>

<p>This top to toe order, taking up one ailment after another
and listing remedies in connection with each, was
already common<a id="FNanchor_1631" href="#Footnote_1631" class="fnanchor">[1631]</a> and is generally followed with some variations
in the manuscripts. The 1497 preface also states that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</span>
the work is divided into four books, but this division is
neither promised nor performed in most of the manuscripts.
Two seem to go no farther than where the third book ends
in the 1497 edition, and two others give the first few chapters
of its fourth book as a separate treatise on fevers.<a id="FNanchor_1632" href="#Footnote_1632" class="fnanchor">[1632]</a>
Indeed the colophon to the 1497 edition states that Peter’s
treatise on fevers has been added to the <i>Thesaurus pauperum</i>.
In the 1578 edition instead of four books we find simply
eighty-five headings representing as many diseases. Some
manuscripts also have tables of contents. Royal 12 B III
gives but fifty-two headings, ending with quartan fever,
while Additional MS. 32,622 and Harleian MS. 5218 sometimes
have more and sometimes fewer headings than the
1497 text, which has 21, 18, 19, and 20 chapters respectively
in its four books. The other manuscripts which I
have seen have to a considerable extent the same headings,
and still more so the same matter, but the order varies
somewhat.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Emphasis
on occult
virtue.</div>

<p>Returning to the preface, we may note that the author
counsels the reader not to despise what he reads because it
is unfamiliar to him, and also not to apply the remedies
before carefully considering the nature of the disease and
the condition of the patient. “And let him study diligently
to learn the natures and constitutions and substances of
things, and as far as he can the occult virtue of particular
things.”<a id="FNanchor_1633" href="#Footnote_1633" class="fnanchor">[1633]</a> Otherwise it will be a case of blind leading blind.
We have already seen that in addition to this profession of
belief in occult virtue of particular objects some manuscripts,
though hardly the oldest or most reliable ones, assert
further that ligatures are not superstitious but act directly,
especially if a right foot is bound on the right foot, or a
male animal on a man.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Authority
and experiment.</div>

<p>The preface also informs us of the sources whence the
work has been compiled. These are “the books of the
ancient philosophers and masters and of modern experimenters.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</span>
The author has tried either to present their views
in their own words, or to express their precise meaning in
other words of easier comprehension, so that if you had
their books at hand you would find nothing other than what
he sets down here, and so that in perusing his book you
may seem to read the originals. The mention of “modern
experimenters” is a foretaste of the “experimental” character
of the <i>Thesaurus pauperum</i>. In some manuscripts
it is called a <i>Book of Experiments</i> or a <i>Summa</i> of medicinal
experiments, and it is sometimes included in collections of
expressly experimental works. One reason for this is the
common medieval use of the word “experimentum” for almost
any medicinal recipe or remedy, but another reason is
that Peter’s remedies are rather empirical in character. And
as early as Galen’s time the Empirics relied partly for their
experiences upon the statements of past authors. Moreover,
we meet throughout the <i>Thesaurus pauperum</i> with assurances
that this or that has been experienced, or that experts
or “Experimenter” have said so, or even that “I have experienced
this.”<a id="FNanchor_1634" href="#Footnote_1634" class="fnanchor">[1634]</a> These uses of the first person are often probably
copied from Peter’s authorities, but they later came to
be regarded as his own experiences, since the 1578 edition
describes the <i>Thesaurus pauperum</i> in the full title as “an
empirical work from all sorts of authors and his own experience.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Some of
his authorities.</div>

<p>Among his authorities Peter makes much use of recent
works and writers, such as Constantinus Africanus and
Platearius and the <i>Antidotarium</i> of Nicholaus, Walter and
Richard and Roger, <i>Experimentator</i> and <i>Lapidarius</i> and
<i>Liber de natura rerum</i>, Gilbert of England and Albertus
Magnus. He of course utilizes such Hebrew and Arabic
medical writers as Isaac, Rasis, Haly, and Avicenna. It
is worth noting as a hint of the superstitious character of
parts of his work that he cites the Kiranides a good deal.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</span>
Galen and “Dyascorides”&mdash;often pseudo, Pliny and Esculapius,
are of course not forgotten.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Parts of
animals:
suspensions.</div>

<p>Much use is made of parts of animals, and perhaps
especially of those least to be mentioned. Less nauseating
examples are, among many similar parts of animals prescribed
for epileptics, the liver of a vulture drunk with its
blood for nine days, or the gall still warm from a dog who
should have been killed the moment the epileptic fell in the
fit. This last is borrowed from Gilbert. Portions of the
human body, too, are employed; for instance, burnt human
bones or the tooth of a dead man. Suspensions from the
neck of such objects as the hairs of a dog or a cabbage root
are also in favor.<a id="FNanchor_1635" href="#Footnote_1635" class="fnanchor">[1635]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Remedies
for
toothache.</div>

<p>Selection of a few details from two or three specimen
chapters will further illustrate the nature of the contents.
For toothache is recommended touching the ailing tooth
with one from a corpse, holding in the mouth violets cooked
in wine, holding a grain of opium between the teeth. Other
remedies are vinegar in which a root of jusquiam has been
boiled, deer horn burnt until it whitens and dries, and a
powder made from dogs’ teeth. Cavities may be filled with
the brain of a partridge or crow’s dung. The latter “breaks
the tooth and removes pain.” A tooth may be easily extracted
by touching it with dog’s milk or applying a hot root
of jusquiam to its roots. But in the latter case beware not
to touch the other teeth or they will fall out too.<a id="FNanchor_1636" href="#Footnote_1636" class="fnanchor">[1636]</a> These
remedies are, however, mild indeed compared to the treatment
for toothache prescribed by Pliny in two chapters of
his <i>Natural History</i>.<a id="FNanchor_1637" href="#Footnote_1637" class="fnanchor">[1637]</a> Nor do I find in those chapters a
passage ascribed to Pliny in the <i>Thesaurus pauperum</i>, in
which one is directed to dig a root without use of iron,
touch the ailing tooth with it for three days, and then
replace it where one has dug it, after which “that tooth will
never ache again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</span></p><div class="sidenote">Prescriptions
for
epilepsy.</div>

<p>For epilepsy besides parts of animals and suspensions
already mentioned, “Experimenter says and I have heard
from experts that eating a wolf’s heart cures.”<a id="FNanchor_1638" href="#Footnote_1638" class="fnanchor">[1638]</a> Or one
may try the following experiment: Take a frog and
split him down the back with a knife, and extract his liver
and wrap it up in a cabbage leaf, and reduce it to a powder
in a sealed pot, and give it to the epileptic to drink with the
best wine. “And if one frog does not cure him, give him
another, and so on until he is cured; and don’t doubt concerning
the cure, for he will be cured beyond a doubt.”<a id="FNanchor_1639" href="#Footnote_1639" class="fnanchor">[1639]</a> From
Constantinus and Walter<a id="FNanchor_1640" href="#Footnote_1640" class="fnanchor">[1640]</a> is repeated the cure of an epileptic
child by bringing him to church on certain days and having
him hear mass and having the priest read over him the Scripture
about this sort of demon not being cast out except by
fasting and prayer. Most of the manuscripts also state that
one who carries with him the names of the three kings who
adored Christ will be free from epilepsy, and some give their
names, Jasper, Baltaser, Melchior.<a id="FNanchor_1641" href="#Footnote_1641" class="fnanchor">[1641]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Against
sorcerers
and
demons.</div>

<p>Under the caption of remedies for witchcraft and possession
by demons are found such procedures as smearing
the walls of the house with the blood of a black dog or burying
a reed filled with quicksilver under the threshold. A
recipe to rescue a patient from infatuation in love produced
by sorcery is hardly translateable, but affords too good an
example of sympathetic magic or of human psychology to
be omitted entirely. “Si quis ad aliquam vel aliquem nimis
amandum maleficiatus fuerit, tum stercus recens illius quem
vel quam diligit ponatur in ocrea vel in calceo dextro amantis,
et calciet se et quamprimum foetorem sentiat, maleficium
solvetur.” It is also stated that wearing the heart of a vulture
makes one popular with all men and very wealthy, and
that by vivisecting the bird hoopoe and eating its still palpitating
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</span>
heart one may learn the future and all secrets concealed
in men’s minds.<a id="FNanchor_1642" href="#Footnote_1642" class="fnanchor">[1642]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>De morbis

<p>Very similar to the remedies of the <i>Thesaurus pauperum</i>
are those in Peter’s treatise on diseases of the eyes.<a id="FNanchor_1643" href="#Footnote_1643" class="fnanchor">[1643]</a> The
works are further alike in being compilations and yet experimental
or empirical. Peter states that he has collected his
material on eye diseases from many books at the urging of a
disciple,<a id="FNanchor_1644" href="#Footnote_1644" class="fnanchor">[1644]</a> and that it is based upon reason and experience.
Of one recipe for removing ingrowing eyebrows he says,
“I have tested this with my own hands”; and he cites as an
experiment of Rasis the trite prescription of using the blood
of a bat to prevent eyebrows or lashes which have been
plucked out from growing again.<a id="FNanchor_1645" href="#Footnote_1645" class="fnanchor">[1645]</a> Millot-Carpentier<a id="FNanchor_1646" href="#Footnote_1646" class="fnanchor">[1646]</a> has
already given a number of these eye-cures, bringing out
chiefly the great use of parts of animals, which we have
already remarked in the case of Gilbert of England. We
may further note a bit of astrology. Peter first makes the
general assertion that the human body is subject to the
planets and signs,<a id="FNanchor_1647" href="#Footnote_1647" class="fnanchor">[1647]</a> and later in describing the eye notes that
it has seven tunics or humors covering it like the seven
planets. There is also, as in the <i>Thesaurus pauperum</i>, some
use of Christian incantations. To remove a fistula from the
eye, besides using the blood from a cock’s crest and pulverized
snakeskin one should bind the leaf of an herb about
the patient’s foot and say, “As Christ descended from heaven
into the Virgin’s womb, so may the fistula descend from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</span>
eye to the foot.”<a id="FNanchor_1648" href="#Footnote_1648" class="fnanchor">[1648]</a> This is of course also an example of the
magic transfer of disease.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Summa
de conservanda
sanitate.</i></div>

<p>A third treatise exists under Peter’s name in a British
Museum manuscript and is called a “Summa concerning the
preservation of health and those things which assist and
harm it.”<a id="FNanchor_1649" href="#Footnote_1649" class="fnanchor">[1649]</a> This work opens in a more self-confident and
flamboyant style than the other treatises where Peter spoke
of himself in a self-depreciatory manner. Now after a few
lines of pious introduction we read, “Let the Jews blush,
the Saracens be put to confusion, roving practitioners desist,
old enchantresses be dumb, and empirics and methodics keep
silence. Let rational physicians rejoice and those descendants
of the medical art who employ both reason and experience.
I, master Petrus Hispanus, a native of Compostella,
have pursued my education (<i>expertus ... alumpniam</i>) in all
Italy, Burgundy, Vienne, Provence, Gascony, and certain
parts of Spain. Certain useful natural phenomena which
are not found in the bosom of the art of medicine I have
discovered by labor, vision, chance, experience, and genius
to be both useful against diseases and the causes of diseases;
and I have demonstrated certain instructive experiments
for conserving the safety of the human mechanism,
and I have experienced that all things from the eighth sphere
to the earth’s center are governed by the law of reason
(<i>veridica ratione habentur</i>).” At first, however, the treatise
consists of general rules and precepts for guarding one’s
health rather than experiments or recipes. Astrology comes
in again in the statement that the motion of the superior
bodies is one of the causes of the shortening of human life.
Presently the author considers different parts of the body
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</span>
in turn, as the brain, eyes, ears, teeth, lungs, heart, stomach,
liver, spleen, and feet, and lists things which are good and
bad for each. Things which harm the brain,<a id="FNanchor_1650" href="#Footnote_1650" class="fnanchor">[1650]</a> for example,
are quicksilver, the cerebellum of all animals except the dog
and the fox, fetid odors, gluttony and drunkenness, sleeping
immediately after eating&mdash;if the brain is weak, bathing after
eating, turbid air, worry over temporal affairs, eating with
bent head, and eating a great deal of fish or milk, cheese,
unripe fruit, and nuts. Among things beneficial for the
eyes frequent washing of the feet is suggested.</p>

Waters.</i></div>

<p><i>A Marvelous Treatise on Waters which master Petrus
Hispanus composed with natural industry guided by the intellect</i>
is found in a number of manuscripts. Sometimes it
appears to be the closing part of his treatise on diseases of
the eyes,<a id="FNanchor_1651" href="#Footnote_1651" class="fnanchor">[1651]</a> and its first item is “a marvelous water to preserve
and clarify the sight.” But it also is found as a separate
treatise, in which directions are given for distilling various
liquids, which in at least one manuscript are accompanied by
two figures of chemical apparatus.<a id="FNanchor_1652" href="#Footnote_1652" class="fnanchor">[1652]</a> In another manuscript
the word <i>philosophus</i> is substituted for <i>master Petrus Hispanus</i>
in the title given at the beginning of this paragraph,
but the treatise is presumably the same.<a id="FNanchor_1653" href="#Footnote_1653" class="fnanchor">[1653]</a> In this case, at
least, it seems to include exactly twelve waters<a id="FNanchor_1654" href="#Footnote_1654" class="fnanchor">[1654]</a> and so to

we treat further in another chapter.<a id="FNanchor_1655" href="#Footnote_1655" class="fnanchor">[1655]</a> Also its last two
“waters” are an elixir of life and alcohol.<a id="FNanchor_1656" href="#Footnote_1656" class="fnanchor">[1656]</a> If Peter of Spain
came from Compostella, he may have had something to do
with a <i>Book of Compostella, which treats of many waters
and of many oils and of many salts of great virtue</i>. However,
Brother Bonaventura, a Franciscan, is said to have
composed the book in the convent of the Brothers of St.

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</span></p><div class="sidenote">Commentaries
on
Isaac’s
<i>Diets</i>:
their
scholastic
method.</div>

<p>We come finally to Peter’s Commentaries upon the works
of Isaac on <i>Universal Diets</i> and <i>Particular Diets</i>.<a id="FNanchor_1665" href="#Footnote_1665" class="fnanchor">[1665]</a> They are
as full as the <i>Thesaurus pauperum</i> was abbreviated and as
scholastic and dialectical in form as it was empirical. Where
Isaac’s text is clear Peter leaves its meaning to the reader’s
industry,<a id="FNanchor_1666" href="#Footnote_1666" class="fnanchor">[1666]</a> but it suggests to him over a thousand further
questions which he takes up one after the other, listing authorities
<i>pro</i> and <i>con</i> in each case and rebutting or reconciling
them. Here we see the handiwork of the author of
the favorite manual of logic of the later middle ages. The
systematic, but abstract, sophistical, and jejune character of
this method may be sufficiently illustrated by quotation of
the closing passage of the “First Lecture” (<i>Lectio prima</i>).<a id="FNanchor_1667" href="#Footnote_1667" class="fnanchor">[1667]</a></p>

<p>“Next we proceed to the fourth point and inquire
whether any food can be found of like nature to our bodies.
And it would seem so, since when foods are called temperate
and equal, they are not called equal except with respect to
the body. But certain foods, such as chicken meat and the
like, are called temperate and equal; therefore it is possible
to find food of like nature to our bodies.”</p>

<p>“Against this three arguments are advanced. The first
is that it is impossible to associate or join two different individuals;
therefore a plant which grows in the earth and
an animal cannot be joined and made one. The second argument
is that nothing which is at first contrary and at last
similar is of like nature to our bodies; but such is food,
according to Aristotle, therefore no food is at all like. The
third argument is that nothing far removed from human
nature in constitution and composition and species is in
any way like human nature. But all food is of this sort;
therefore no food at all resembles the nature of our bodies,
which we concede.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</span></p>

<p>“But it should be said anent these opposing arguments
that ‘like’ may be understood in two senses. Either it means
alike in all respects, and so no food is like. In the second
sense, it means that it makes no manifest impression on the
body, and in this sense some foods are called of like nature,
such as chicken.”</p>

<p>“Next it is asked whether human flesh is nourishing,
since nutriment goes by likeness. And it would seem so, for
Isaac says that man is not nourished by the elements, since
he is too far removed from them. Therefore that flesh
which approaches closest to human nature should be the most
nutritious. But this is human flesh; hence human flesh
should be very nutritious. Here is another argument. Nutriment
is from likeness, and from equal nutriment comes a
well-balanced state of health; now the human constitution
is especially temperate and well-balanced; therefore it requires
temperate and equal food, and such, some agree, is
human flesh. We, however, call it the worst sort of nutriment
for two reasons: one, its corrruptibility; the other, its
excessive unctuosity. For as the flesh of the body endures
by virtue of the presence of the soul, so after the spirit’s
departure the flesh becomes moist, vile, and fetid; and herein
lies the solution of the difficulty, since if it is temperate, it
has this property from the soul while it exists in the body.”</p>

<p>As to what the effect would be of eating men alive, Peter
does not state. His argument may have possessed an additional
interest for his own time from the possibility of applying
it in theological as well as medical matters,&mdash;for
example, the sacrament of the Eucharist.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Their
questions
concerning
nature.</div>

<p>Many of the questions raised by Peter are concrete
enough, however, and supply, not only some definite information
on the history of domestic science and of the medieval
table, but also interesting illustration of the scope of that
medieval curiosity concerning nature to which we have more
than once adverted. Such questions continue the type of
natural science of which the <i>Problems</i> of Aristotle and the
<i>Natural Questions</i> of Adelard of Bath are earlier instances.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</span>
Those of Peter are the more impressive in that some of them

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Absence
of astrology
and
occult
virtue.</div>

<p>Some of the questions which Peter raises one might expect
him to solve by an appeal to occult virtue, sympathy and
antipathy existing between things in nature, or the superior
influence of the stars. This, however, he almost never does;
his reasoning is based rather on the prevalence of the four
qualities, hot and cold, dry and moist, in natural objects.
Thus the property of dove’s blood of removing spots from
the eye is attributed to its heat and humidity, not to any
occult power.<a id="FNanchor_1672" href="#Footnote_1672" class="fnanchor">[1672]</a> And sparrows, although epileptics themselves,
are said to cure epilepsy because they are very hot and
dry and consume the humors or vapors which cause epilepsy,
not by antipathy or because like cures like.<a id="FNanchor_1673" href="#Footnote_1673" class="fnanchor">[1673]</a> Even less does
one note any instances of ligatures and suspensions, characters
and incantations. One or two passages show, however,
that Peter believes in occult virtue and the rule of the
stars. He states that in addition to the four simple elements
“there is another simplicity ... namely, from qualities, and
it is not in the elements but in the celestial bodies.”<a id="FNanchor_1674" href="#Footnote_1674" class="fnanchor">[1674]</a> And in
his prologue to the <i>Particular Diets</i> he affirms that celestials
are the cause of inferiors and quotes the words addressed by
God to the stars in Plato’s <i>Timaeus</i>, “O gods of gods, whose
father and creator I am, by your nature you are dissoluble
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</span>
but by my will indissoluble,” to prove how much more corruptible
inferior bodies are.<a id="FNanchor_1675" href="#Footnote_1675" class="fnanchor">[1675]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Incorrect
ideas about
Nature.</div>

<p>Despite the almost complete absence of superstitious
practices and of astrological and magical doctrine from the
<i>Commentaries on Isaac</i> it is of course true that Peter harbors
many incorrect notions such as that fish lack bones and
that hot water freezes harder and quicker than cold.<a id="FNanchor_1676" href="#Footnote_1676" class="fnanchor">[1676]</a> This
last, however, he supports by the authority and arguments
of Aristotle and Avicenna. Peter also throughout the work
displays faith in the validity of compound medicines, although
he raises the suggestive question, why compound
foods are more often injurious than compound medicines.
He also accepts various stories of animal remedies and
sagacity for which he finds support in Aristotle’s <i>History of
Animals</i>, such as that the serpent eats fennel to restore or
sharpen its sight,<a id="FNanchor_1677" href="#Footnote_1677" class="fnanchor">[1677]</a> and that the bone in the heart of the stag
is especially beneficial for heart disease because “the stag is
very ingenious and astute and so eats potent herbs which
especially affect the heart like parsley and origanum,” and
from these the bone forms.<a id="FNanchor_1678" href="#Footnote_1678" class="fnanchor">[1678]</a> In explaining why deer shed
their horns and hide them, Peter incorrectly makes Aristotle
say that they secrete the right horn with more care, whereas
the <i>History of Animals</i> states, “It is said that no one has
ever seen the left horn, for he conceals it as if it had some
medicinal (or, magic) power.”<a id="FNanchor_1679" href="#Footnote_1679" class="fnanchor">[1679]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Reason
and experience.</div>

<p>Finally, despite the scholastic form of Peter’s Commentary,
it contains a long passage on the importance of experimental
method or “the way of experience” (<i>via experimenti</i>),<a id="FNanchor_1680" href="#Footnote_1680" class="fnanchor">[1680]</a>
f which it couples with “the path of reason” (<i>via rationis</i>)
as the two methods by which dietary science may be
investigated. First Peter distinguishes between the two,
then shows the necessity of the way of experience, and third
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</span>
that it can and should be confirmed by reason. Galen says
that experience is weak without reason, and so is reason
when not joined to experience. Some say that reason should
precede experience, that first we should seek rationally, then
test by experience. In any case the way of experience proceeds
through effects, the way of reason through causes.
The one method is inductive; the other, syllogistic; the one
based on immediate effects, the other on mediate effects.
“Experimental method pays no attention to causes; rational
method considers causes and principles; experience
makes use of the senses; reason, of the intellect” and arguments.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Via experimenti.</i></div>

<p>After listing various arguments <i>pro</i> and <i>con</i> as to
whether the <i>via experiment</i> “is of art and in art, or precedes
art,” Peter gives his solution to the effect that <i>experimentum</i>
is threefold. As a method of attaining knowledge it antecedes
all arts and sciences. As a method of making known
the objects of scientific inquiry, it is a part of science. As
an application of scientific doctrine to practical life and industry,
it follows science. Furthermore, experience “may
proceed regularly through science and doctrine and in this
way it can be rational.” Or it may be irregular and not
syllogistic in method. The experimental discoveries of
brutes, as when the serpent restores its sight with fennel,
come to them from nature, but ours are acquired by art and
confirmed by reason, although man too possesses the experimental
instinct. Peter further distinguishes the experiences
of rustics, which are unregulated by reason, from the experiments
of skilled men which are regulated by reason. Moreover,
“experiences are not without their reasons, and idle is
the experiment which does not rest on reason.” Finally,
Peter gives six conditions requisite in medical experimentation
which are somewhat similar to the seven conditions
stated by his contemporary, John of St. Amand. First, the
medicine administered should be free from all foreign substance.<a id="FNanchor_1681" href="#Footnote_1681" class="fnanchor">[1681]</a>
Second, the patient taking it should have the disease
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_510">[Pg 510]</span>
for which it is especially intended. Third, it should be
given alone without admixture of other medicine. Fourth,
it should be of the opposite degree to the disease. Fifth,
“we should test it not once only but many times.” Sixth,
“the experiments should be with the proper body, as on the
body of a man and not of an ass.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Question
of Peter’s
relation
to Roger
Bacon and
Galen.</div>

<p>Peter’s discussion of the <i>via experimenti</i> is in several
respects similar to Roger Bacon’s discussion of experimental
science, but is probably quite independent of it. Peter died
before Roger in 1277, and his <i>Commentary on Isaac</i> was
probably composed before the works which Bacon addressed
to the pope in and around the year 1267. The influence of
Galen, who had discussed the part played by reason and
experience in his own work on food values, upon Peter is
fairly evident.</p>

<div class="sidenote">John of
St. Amand
on medical
experimentation.</div>

<p>John of St. Amand, to whose similar conditions for
medical experimentation we just alluded, was a canon of
Tournai who seems to have written a little later than Peter,
since he describes the death from vomiting of a bishop of
Tournai which took place in 1261.<a id="FNanchor_1682" href="#Footnote_1682" class="fnanchor">[1682]</a> It is in his commentary
on the <i>Antidotarium</i> of Nicolaus that John gives his seven
conditions for medical experimentation. After having said
that on account of the scarcity and incompleteness of experience,
we should sometimes learn the virtues of simple medicines
“through doctrine,” John for a page or two discusses
other matters, but then reverts to the subject of experimentation.
A medicinal simple, he says, may be known by two
methods, “the way of experience and the way of reason.”
“And because the principles of experience are better known
to us than the principles of reason, let us first inquire concerning
the knowledge of medicinal simples by the way of
experience.” He goes on to say that experience is twofold
as it is supported or not supported by reason. If unsupported
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_511">[Pg 511]</span>
by reason experience or experiment is timorous and fallacious.
As for experience supported by reason, it should conform
to these seven requirements.<a id="FNanchor_1683" href="#Footnote_1683" class="fnanchor">[1683]</a> First, “the medicinal simple
which is being tested should be pure and free from every
extraneous quality, lest by such extraneous quality the proper
operation of the medicine be impeded, and in consequence
experimental knowledge.”<a id="FNanchor_1684" href="#Footnote_1684" class="fnanchor">[1684]</a> Here the use of the adjective,
“experimental” is interesting. Second, the experimentation
should be with a simple and not a complicated disease.<a id="FNanchor_1685" href="#Footnote_1685" class="fnanchor">[1685]</a>
Third, the simple should be tested in two contrary types of
disease, because sometimes a medicine cures one disease by
its “complexion” or elemental properties and another by its
occult virtue. Thus scammony cures both quotidian and
tertian fever; the first because scammony is of a hot nature;
but the second by its occult virtue and not because scammony
is of a cold nature, for it is not.<a id="FNanchor_1686" href="#Footnote_1686" class="fnanchor">[1686]</a> Fourth, the virtue
of the medicine should correspond to the quality of the
patient. Fifth, essence and accident should not be confused;
water, for example, may be heated, but is not of a
hot nature.<a id="FNanchor_1687" href="#Footnote_1687" class="fnanchor">[1687]</a> Sixth, the experiment should be often repeated.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</span>
For if a medicine is tested in the cases of five men and has a
heating effect upon them all, still that is not adequate proof
that it will always have a heating effect, for they may have
all been of a cold or temperate constitution, whereas a man
of hot nature would not be heated by the simple in question.
Seventh, the test should be on the human body and in varying
states of health. Trying the medicine upon a lion may
not prove anything as to its effect upon a man.<a id="FNanchor_1688" href="#Footnote_1688" class="fnanchor">[1688]</a> John seems
to have taken his conditions directly from Galen rather than
from Petrus Hispanus, since only three of them are identical
with Peter’s, whereas all but one occur in his own <i>Concordances</i>
from Galen’s works.<a id="FNanchor_1689" href="#Footnote_1689" class="fnanchor">[1689]</a> John of St. Amand repeats
the experiment with the hazel rod which we have already
encountered in William of Auvergne. According to
John the two split halves tend to reunite because it is natural
for them to be together, but he adds that some old women
make use of it with utterance of a useless incantation as a
matrimonial charm, asserting that if the halves unite, the
marriage will be a happy one.<a id="FNanchor_1690" href="#Footnote_1690" class="fnanchor">[1690]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Natural
and occult
science in
John of
St. Amand.</div>

<p>It was not my intention to speak of John of St. Amand
further than to compare his remarks on experimental method
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</span>
with those of Petrus Hispanus, but the <i>Histoire Littéraire</i>
has already presented some specimens of his views, which
it will be worth repeating to show that his experimental tendency
has the same accompaniment of mingled credulity and
scepticism and of occult science and signs of magic as we
have noted in other cases. Thus he rejects the story that
the beaver castrates itself to escape the pursuit of hunters
on the ground that the animal has not that much sense, but
believes that beavers enslave one another. From the fact
that herons are subject to diarrhoea he argues that men with
long necks and legs should not resort to purgatives, and he
states that pearls comfort the heart by similarity, since they
are hard like the heart. He enters into long and obscure
explanations how it is that application of the flesh of a snake
extracts the venom from its bite, and “is not exempt from
astrological ideas.”<a id="FNanchor_1691" href="#Footnote_1691" class="fnanchor">[1691]</a> But the writings of John of St.
Amand have carried us well along into the second half of
the thirteenth century; in the next chapter we must turn back
to a man whose literary activity began in the Erst half of
that century, Albertus Magnus.</p>

changed and begins: “<i>Characteres

<p class="h3sub">SOME MANUSCRIPTS OF THE THESAURUS PAUPERUM</p>

<p>I have examined the following MSS of the work in the
collections in the British Museum. As usual, the dating of
the MSS is not my own, but either that given in the catalogues
of the collections or in the MSS themselves.</p>

<div class="hangingblockquote">

<p>Sloane 282, quarto, 15th century, fols. 87-105, Petri Hispani, postea
Johannis Papae XXI, Thesaurus pauperum.</p>

<p>Sloane 284, 15th century, fols. 129-174. “Incipit liber qui thesaurus
pauperum nominatur compositus a magistro P. Hispano Papa
Johanne postmodum.”</p>

<p>Sloane 477, dated Sept. 30, 1309. Fol. 79r, “Explicit thesaurus
pauperum ad honorem dei et hominum ipsius operis exigentium.
Anno domine mill’o tricentessimo nono die tricessimo mense septembris
hoc opus complevi scripsi presbitur N. De. Machia Anconitana
hunc scripsit librum cui Christus filius dei et virginis
matris marie det sibi gratiam consolationem anime et corpori.
Amen.” Then in different ink is added, “Explicit thesaurus
pauperum vel summa experimentorum medicinalium magistri
petri Hispani.” This MS, which seems as early as any that I
examined, is written on small pages in large print-like letters.
The red ink of the text has faded and is accompanied by numerous
notes in small black writing.</p>

<p>Sloane 521, 14th-15th century, fols. 46-74. “Explicit summa Petri
Hispanensis experimentorum medicinalium, cujus libri posuit
nomen thesaurus pauperum. Amen. Amen.”</p>

<p>Sloane 1754, 14th century, fols. 8-13. “Flos florum experimentorum
thesauri pauperum a magistro Petro Yspano” etc. A collection
of excerpts from the work; see also Sloane 357 and 405, both
15th century.</p>

<p>Sloane 2479, 14th century, fols. 10-41. At fol. 38v, “Explicit thesaurus
pauperum”; at fol. 41v, “Expliciunt febres et thesaurus
pauperum magni petri hispani quondam pape.”</p>

<p>Additional MS 22,636, fols. 23-35r (and not, as the catalogue and
Scott’s Index say, to fol. 47, since a work on Phisionomia and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_515">[Pg 515]</span>
some extracts from Thomas of Cantimpré on seals and gems
intervene.) “Explicit liber qui dicitur tesaurus pauperum.”</p>

<p>Additional 25,000. This MS resembles Sloane 2479 closely in its
arrangement: at fol. 94r, “Explicit liber pauperum”; at fol. 96v,
another Explicit follows the discussion of fevers.</p>

<p>Addit. 32,622, early 14th century, fols. 116-177. “Summa experimentorum
medicinalium Magistri Petri Ispaliensis, qui dicitur
liber nomine thesaurus pauperum.”</p>

<p>Royal 12-B-III, 14th century, #2.</p>

<p>Harleian 5218. “Petri Hispani Thesaurus pauperum, Liber medicus
cum complexionibus simplicium medicinarum, secundum Gallianum
de Sancta Sophya Phisicum.”</p>
</div>

<p>I have not been able to consult the following MSS in the
Amplonian collection at Erfurt, but mention them as of
early date and not listed by Stapper.</p>

<div class="hangingblockquote">

<p>Ampion. Octavo 62, early 14th century hand, fols. 124-165, Rubr.
“Incipit thesaurus pauperum editus per Iohannem papam.”</p>

<p>Ampion. Quarto 193, end of 13th century to 1362-1364, fols. 2-49.
“Incipit liber experimentorum, qui thesaurus pauperum nuncupatur.”</p>

<p>Ampion. Folio 271, 13th-14th century (Schum omits this in the
index to his catalogue of the Amplonian collection).</p>

<p>Ampion. Folio 303, fols. 147-63.</p>

<p>Another early copy is contained in a miscellany compiled at Bologna
in 1326: Wolfenbüttel 4504, fols. 106-31, Explicit summa
medicinalis Magistri Petri Yspani, que dicitur thesaurus pauperum.</p>
</div>

<p>A few other MSS of the Thesaurus pauperum are:</p>

<div class="hangingblockquote">

<p>Ste. Geneviève 2235, 14th century, “Incipit Summa experimentorum
medicinalium magistri Petri Hispani, que dicitur thesaurus
pauperum.”</p>

<p>Ste. Geneviève 2237, 18th century, fol. 57, “Incipit pauperum thesaurus
summi medicorum monarchae D. Joannis XX (XXI)
pontificis maximi cui Petro Hispano ante nomen erat in quo
curandorum morborum et theoresim et praxim absolutissime comperies.”</p>

<p>BN 8654, 14th century, perhaps 1306 A. D.</p>

<p>Trivulz. 657, 14th century.</p>

<p>Turin F-V-25, 14th century, fols. 93-177.</p>

<h4><i>Bibliography Concerning Albertus Magnus</i></h4>

<p>In the following bibliography I include some works that
I have not been able to examine and cannot vouch for, and
omit others which I have seen but which seemed of doubtful
value or treated sides of Albert’s personality and writings
which have little connection with our investigation, such
as accounts of Albert as a saint, or theologian, or metaphysician,
or psychologist. Of recent years a bewildering underbrush
of German monographs has sprung up concerning
Albert as one of the few prominent persons that Germany
could claim as its own among the many scholars of the medieval
period.</p>

<p>A number of works that do not deal primarily with Albert
will be cited in the course of the chapter rather than
here, and mention of his individual works and of manuscripts
of them will also be found in connection with the
following text.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_519">[Pg 519]</span></p>

<h4>I. <i>His Own Writings</i></h4>

<div class="hangingblockquote">

<p>M. Weiss. Primordia novae bibliographiae B. Alberti
Magni, Paris, 1898.</p>

<p>B. Alberti Magni Opera omnia, ed. Augustus Borgnet,
Paris, 1890-1899, in 38 vols. My references are regularly
to this edition. Its text, however, has been a good deal
criticized.</p>

<p>Of more recent and critical editions of single works by
Albert, that of the Historia animalium by H. Stadler from
the Cologne autograph MS in Beiträge z. Gesch. d. Philos,
d. Mittelalters, vols. 15-16, is the only one of a work with
which we are concerned. Stadler attempts to distinguish
Albert’s additions from Aristotle’s text and to trace their
sources. German criticism of the genuineness of large
portions of the text of Aristotle’s Historia animalium has
in my opinion been carried altogether too far and based
upon the gratuitous assumption that Aristotle would not
have said anything superstitious. For recent editions of
other single works by Albert see v. Hertling (1914) 23.</p>

<p>Separate bibliographies of printed texts and MSS of certain
works of doubtful or spurious authorship ascribed
to Albert will be given later in separate chapters dealing
with these.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The leading
figure
in thirteenth
century
learning.</div>

<p>At last we come to the consideration of the dominant figure
in Latin learning and natural science of the thirteenth century,
with whose course his lifetime was nearly coincident,
the most prolific of its writers, the most influential of its
teachers, the dean of its scholars, the one learned man of
the twelfth and thirteenth centuries to be called “the Great,”&mdash;Albertus
Magnus. The length of his life and presumably
also of his period of literary productivity makes it difficult to
place him at any particular point in the century, and from
the fact that Vincent of Beauvais and Peter of Spain cite
him we might well have placed our account of his works
before theirs. He appears, however, to have outlived them
both. But it is mainly in order to bring our account of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_522">[Pg 522]</span>
Albert into juxtaposition with our treatment of the other
two great names of Thomas Aquinas and Roger Bacon, to
determine whether the <i>Speculum astronomiae</i> should be ascribed
to Roger rather than Albert, and to treat of books
of experiments and magic, that have been ascribed to Albert
but are perhaps of somewhat later date, in connection with
other similar experimental and occult literature, that we have
postponed our consideration of Albertus Magnus until this
point.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Albert and
Aquinas.</div>

<p>In 1253, the same year that Robert Grosseteste died,
four years after William of Auvergne, opened the pontificate
of Alexander IV, of which Ptolemy of Lucca wrote: “In
his time flourished two great doctors in the Order of Preachers.
Doubtless many others were famous during this same
time both in life and doctrine. But these two transcended
and deserve to be placed before all others.”<a id="FNanchor_1692" href="#Footnote_1692" class="fnanchor">[1692]</a> The two
Dominicans whom Ptolemy had in mind were, of course,
Albertus Magnus and Thomas Aquinas.<a id="FNanchor_1693" href="#Footnote_1693" class="fnanchor">[1693]</a> It is customary
and natural to couple their names. Besides being members
of the same order, they were master and student; they were
also the two scholars of their time who did most to adapt the
natural philosophy of Aristotle to Christian use, a fact
which in itself suggests their interest in natural science. It
may seem strange to us today that two theologians, and even
more so two members of an order vowed to asceticism,
apostolic poverty, and the maintenance of strict orthodoxy
against heresy, should play a leading part in interpreting the
ideas of Greek and Arabic philosophers and should display
such an interest in natural science. The fact, however, is
indisputable. It is to the credit of the medieval church and
its religious orders. But it is even more a tribute to the
power that philosophy and natural science exercise upon
every able mind that really studies them. As for the relations
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_523">[Pg 523]</span>
between Albert and Aquinas, it must be added that
while the former outlived his pupil, he was born a full generation
before him. It was thus Aquinas who profited by
and built upon Albert’s work.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dates of
birth and
death.</div>

<p>Ptolemy of Lucca states that Albertus Magnus was over
eighty years old when he died in 1280, and that for about
three years before his death he largely lost control of his intellectual
faculties.<a id="FNanchor_1694" href="#Footnote_1694" class="fnanchor">[1694]</a> That he outlived his pupil Aquinas by
six years, and that his writings are cited by other contemporaries
who died before he did&mdash;Vincent of Beauvais and
Petrus Hispanus, are other indications of his longevity.
There consequently seems little reason for questioning the
traditional date of his birth, 1193, although Pouchet has suggested
1205<a id="FNanchor_1695" href="#Footnote_1695" class="fnanchor">[1695]</a> and Father Mandonnet, more recently, 1206.<a id="FNanchor_1696" href="#Footnote_1696" class="fnanchor">[1696]</a>
The main argument for placing his birth about 1206 is that
a fourteenth century chronicler<a id="FNanchor_1697" href="#Footnote_1697" class="fnanchor">[1697]</a> states that he was only sixteen
when he entered the Dominican Order, while in the fifteenth
century Peter of Prussia asserts that Albert himself
used to say that he had been in the Order “from his very
boyhood.”<a id="FNanchor_1698" href="#Footnote_1698" class="fnanchor">[1698]</a> His birthplace was at Lauingen in Swabia and
he was the oldest son of the count of Bollstädt.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Early
life.</div>

<p>Albert studied at Padua, where he tells us that in his
youth he saw a well which exhaled a deadly vapor,<a id="FNanchor_1699" href="#Footnote_1699" class="fnanchor">[1699]</a> while at
Venice he beheld a royal figure painted by nature upon
marble.<a id="FNanchor_1700" href="#Footnote_1700" class="fnanchor">[1700]</a> He perhaps entered the Dominican Order in 1222
or 1223. According to Peter of Prussia,<a id="FNanchor_1701" href="#Footnote_1701" class="fnanchor">[1701]</a> a few years later
he was made reader or lecturer of the friars at Cologne and
“twice gloriously lectured on the <i>Sentences</i>.” Then he was
successively <i>Lector</i> at Hildesheim in 1233, at Freiburg, for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_524">[Pg 524]</span>
two years in Ratisbon, and at Strasburg. Albert alludes in
his works to a comet which he saw in Saxony in 1240.<a id="FNanchor_1702" href="#Footnote_1702" class="fnanchor">[1702]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Probable
early date
of some
of his
works.</div>

<p>Although Ptolemy of Lucca mentions Albert and Aquinas
as flourishing during the pontificate of Alexander IV,
1253-1261, much of the former’s writing as well as teaching
probably antedates this. Presumably he was already famous
when young Aquinas came all the way from Italy to Cologne
or Paris to study with him about 1244 or 1245. If the
<i>Speculum naturale</i> of Vincent of Beauvais was written by
1250, many of Albert’s writings which it freely cites must
have appeared before that date, for instance, the <i>De anima</i>
(III, 41), <i>De sensu et sensato</i> (V. 108), <i>De somno et vigilia</i>
(XXVI, 23), <i>De animalibus</i> (XVII, 71). The treatise on
sleep and waking is found in a manuscript written in a French
hand in 1258.<a id="FNanchor_1703" href="#Footnote_1703" class="fnanchor">[1703]</a> Even in the treatise on minerals,<a id="FNanchor_1704" href="#Footnote_1704" class="fnanchor">[1704]</a> which has
been regarded as written after 1250 because Vincent of Beauvais
does not cite it, and in which Albert speaks of having
been in Paris as well as Cologne, he also speaks of one of
his associates who saw in the possession of the emperor,
Frederick II, 1212-1250, a magnet which instead of attracting
iron was drawn to that metal.<a id="FNanchor_1705" href="#Footnote_1705" class="fnanchor">[1705]</a> On the other hand, in his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_525">[Pg 525]</span>
work on animals Albert cites the emperor Frederick’s book
on falcons, so that Albert’s treatise on animals was probably
not finished until at least the latter part of that monarch’s
reign.<a id="FNanchor_1706" href="#Footnote_1706" class="fnanchor">[1706]</a> But even Mandonnet who delays Albert’s birth to
1206 believes that his first writings date back to 1240 and
that his great philosophical works began to appear about
1245. I should be inclined to push these dates back ten or
twenty years. Albert was probably teaching at Paris from
about 1245 to 1248, in which year he signed the condemnation
of the <i>Talmud</i> in that city and then became regent of
the new school at Cologne established by the Dominicans.<a id="FNanchor_1707" href="#Footnote_1707" class="fnanchor">[1707]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Events of
his life
after 1250.</div>

<p>The two chief ecclesiastical offices held by Albert were
those of provincial of his order in Germany from 1254 to
1257, and of bishop of Ratisbon, 1260-1262. He resigned
from both positions, apparently preferring the scholar’s life.
Ptolemy of Lucca explains that German bishops had to use
the sword too much for Albert’s taste. In his work on animals
Albert alludes in one passage to his villa on the Danube.<a id="FNanchor_1708" href="#Footnote_1708" class="fnanchor">[1708]</a>
In 1256 he went to Rome to defend the friars against
the attacks of William of St. Amour, and while in Italy discovered
the <i>De motibus animalium</i> of Aristotle. In his theological
<i>Summa</i> he speaks of having collected the material
for his treatise <i>On the Unity of the Intellect against Averroes</i>,
when he was “in the <i>curia</i> at the command of Lord
Alexander the Pope.”<a id="FNanchor_1709" href="#Footnote_1709" class="fnanchor">[1709]</a> In 1259, when the general chapter
of the Dominicans met at Valenciennes, he was appointed
upon a committee to draw up a course of study for the Order
along with Aquinas and Pietro di Tarantasia, who in 1276
became Pope Innocent V. After resigning the bishopric of
Ratisbon in 1262, Albert returned to teaching at Cologne,
but in 1263 he preached the crusade in Germany and Bohemia,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_526">[Pg 526]</span>
and his name appears in documents at Würzburg in
that year and those immediately following.<a id="FNanchor_1710" href="#Footnote_1710" class="fnanchor">[1710]</a> In his <i>Politics</i>
he speaks of having been papal <i>nuncius</i> in Saxony and Poland,
where he found the barbaric custom still observed of
killing the old men of the tribe when they had outlived their
period of usefulness.<a id="FNanchor_1711" href="#Footnote_1711" class="fnanchor">[1711]</a> We are told that in 1270 he despatched
a treatise to Paris to help Aquinas in connection with
the affair of Siger de Brabant, and in 1277 visited that city
again in person to defend his own Aristotelian teaching and
the memory of Aquinas in connection with the condemnation
by Stephen Tempier, bishop of Paris, and other doctors
of 219 opinions ascribed to the same Siger de Brabant and
others,<a id="FNanchor_1712" href="#Footnote_1712" class="fnanchor">[1712]</a>&mdash;an affair of which we shall have more to say later.
The Catholic Encyclopedia and <i>Dictionnaire d’histoire et de
géographie ecclésiastique</i> repeat the assertion of fifteenth
century biographers that Albert attended the Council of
Lyons in 1274, but the <i>Histoire Littéraire de la France</i>
eighty years ago assured us that his name is not mentioned
in the records of that assembly.<a id="FNanchor_1713" href="#Footnote_1713" class="fnanchor">[1713]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Albert at
Cologne.</div>

<p>This brief account of Albert’s life has made it evident
that he stayed in no one place for long at a time, and his
own works show that he had traveled widely. He seems,
however, to have returned repeatedly to Cologne, and to
have passed more time there than at any other one place.
There he saw ruined remains of Roman buildings excavated;<a id="FNanchor_1714" href="#Footnote_1714" class="fnanchor">[1714]</a>
there he says that he wrote his <i>De natura locorum</i>;<a id="FNanchor_1715" href="#Footnote_1715" class="fnanchor">[1715]</a>
and there other of his writings, partly in his own hand, were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_527">[Pg 527]</span>
still treasured when Peter of Prussia wrote his life near the
close of the fifteenth century.<a id="FNanchor_1716" href="#Footnote_1716" class="fnanchor">[1716]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Contemporary
estimates
of
Albert.</div>

<p>We have seen that Albert was already cited as an authority
during his lifetime by such writers as Petrus Hispanus
and Vincent of Beauvais. Roger Bacon in 1267 mentioned
“Brother Albert of the Order of Friars Preachers” and
William of Shyrwood as two of the foremost scholars of
the time, although he seems rather jealous of Albert and
inclined to rank William of Shyrwood and of course himself
above him.<a id="FNanchor_1717" href="#Footnote_1717" class="fnanchor">[1717]</a> Such envy only proves the great reputation
that Albert had. In the <i>Summa philosophiae</i> ascribed to
Grosseteste but which we have seen was apparently written
some years after his death, following a long list of ancient
and Arabian philosophers and some comparatively modern
Christian writers such as Gundissalinus, Constantinus, and
Alfred of England, the author mentions as even “more
modern” Alexander minor, presumably Alexander of Hales
the Franciscan who died in 1245, and Albert of Cologne of
the Order of Preachers. He regards them as distinguished
philosophers but not to be held for authorities. However,
he later prefers Albert’s explanation of the virtues of gems
to those of Democritus, Pythagoras, Plato, Hermes, and
Avicenna. He also calls Albert “the most famous of modern
theologians,” and gives his arguments against vision being
by extramission.<a id="FNanchor_1718" href="#Footnote_1718" class="fnanchor">[1718]</a> Ulrich Engelbert of Strasburg, a contemporary
and pupil of Albert, in the fourth book of his
<i>Summa theologiae</i> described “my lord Albert, once bishop
of Ratisbon,” as “a man in every science so divine that he
may well be called the wonder and miracle of our time.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_528">[Pg 528]</span><a id="FNanchor_1719" href="#Footnote_1719" class="fnanchor">[1719]</a>
Thomas of Cantimpré, in his moralizing <i>Bonum universale
de apibus</i>, a farrago of monkish gossip and incredible tales,
written apparently in 1276 or shortly after, emphasizes the
saintly character of Albert who is apparently well along in
years when Thomas writes.<a id="FNanchor_1720" href="#Footnote_1720" class="fnanchor">[1720]</a> He represents Albert as having
told him that at Paris a demon appeared to him in the likeness
of a certain friar in an attempt to keep him from his
studies but departed at the sign of the cross.<a id="FNanchor_1721" href="#Footnote_1721" class="fnanchor">[1721]</a> Or again
Thomas assures us that as Albert’s auditor for a considerable
time when he occupied the chair of theology he had seen
for himself and “most certainly tested” how Albert for many
years almost daily participated in the prayers by day and
night and read the psalter of David and often sweated in
religious contemplation and meditation. “What wonder,”
piously ejaculates Thomas, “that a man of such whole-hearted
devotion and piety should show superhuman attainments
in science!”<a id="FNanchor_1722" href="#Footnote_1722" class="fnanchor">[1722]</a></p>

<h4 id="AS_A_SCIENTIST">II. <i>As a Scientist</i></h4>

<div class="sidenote">The scope
of Albert’s
scientific
treatises.</div>

<p>It may be well at the start to indicate the scope and
character of Albert’s works in the field of science. In general
they follow the plan of the natural philosophy of Aristotle
and parallel the titles of the works then attributed, in
some cases incorrectly, to Aristotle. We have eight books
of physics, psychological treatises such as the <i>De anima</i> and
<i>De somno et vigilia</i>, both in three books, and works dealing
with celestial phenomena, such as the <i>De meteoris</i> and <i>De
coelo et mundo</i> in four books each, and with the universe
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_529">[Pg 529]</span>
and life in general, such as the <i>De causis et procreatione
universi</i>, <i>De causis et proprietatibus elementorum et planetarum</i>,
and the <i>De generatione et corruptione</i>. Geography is
represented by the <i>De natura locorum</i>, zoology by the twenty-six
books on animals, botany by the seven books on vegetables
and plants, and mineralogy by the five books on minerals.
Björnbo called attention to a work on mirrors or
catoptric ascribed to “Albert the Preacher” in several manuscripts
but which is not included in the editions of Albert’s
works and which has never been printed.<a id="FNanchor_1723" href="#Footnote_1723" class="fnanchor">[1723]</a> I do not know
if this is the same treatise as a treatise on Perspective attributed
to Albertus Magnus in a manuscript which Björnbo
did not mention.<a id="FNanchor_1724" href="#Footnote_1724" class="fnanchor">[1724]</a> A work on the planting of trees and preserving
of wine is sometimes ascribed to Albert in the manuscripts,
but is probably rather by Petrus de Crescentiis or
Galfridus de Vino Salvo.<a id="FNanchor_1725" href="#Footnote_1725" class="fnanchor">[1725]</a> I think that I have encountered
only once in the manuscripts the attribution to Albert of an
epitome of the <i>Almagest</i> of Ptolemy<a id="FNanchor_1726" href="#Footnote_1726" class="fnanchor">[1726]</a> and of a <i>Summa
astrologiae</i>.<a id="FNanchor_1727" href="#Footnote_1727" class="fnanchor">[1727]</a> Fairly frequently one meets with some brief
compendium of all natural philosophy ascribed to Albert, of
which perhaps the most common is the <i>Philosophia pauperum</i>
or “Introduction to the books of Aristotle on physics,
sky and universe, generation and corruption, meteorology,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_530">[Pg 530]</span>
and the soul.”<a id="FNanchor_1728" href="#Footnote_1728" class="fnanchor">[1728]</a> These are either spurious, or, if based on
Albert’s writings, add nothing of importance to them. Finally
we may note a group of works lying on the border of
natural and occult science and which have been regarded as
spurious: treatises on alchemy and chiromancy, the <i>Speculum
astronomiae</i>, the <i>De secretis mulierum</i>, the <i>Liber aggregationis</i>,
and the <i>De mirabilibus mundi</i>. Of some of
these we shall treat in separate chapters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Can a
gradual
intellectual
development
be traced
in Albert’s
works?</div>

<p>The order in which Albert’s numerous works were written
is a matter difficult to determine but of some interest,
although not of very great importance, for our investigation.
The statement of Peter of Prussia that the translation
of Aristotle “which we now use in the schools” was
made by Thomas of Cantimpré at the suggestion of Aquinas,
“for in Albert’s time all commonly used the old translation,”<a id="FNanchor_1729" href="#Footnote_1729" class="fnanchor">[1729]</a>
would, if true, suggest that Albert wrote his Aristotelian
treatises early in life, since he actually outlived
Aquinas. But not much reliance is to be placed in this
statement of Peter, since it is reasonably certain that Thomas
of Cantimpré at least did not translate Aristotle. I have
been impressed by differing and almost inconsistent attitudes
in different treatises by Albert, for instance in his attitude
towards magic, which seem to hint that his opinions changed
with the years, although it may be attributable, as in some
other authors, to the fact that in different works he reflects
the attitude of different authorities, or approaches different
subjects with a different view-point, writing of theology as
a theologian, but of Aristotle as a philosopher. However,
Baeumker and Schneider, pursuing in connection with Albert’s
writings a different line of investigation from mine,
have been struck with the same thing and have concluded that
Albert underwent a gradual intellectual development. They
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_531">[Pg 531]</span>
note that in his <i>Commentaries on the Sentences</i> he is still
glued to the Augustinian tradition, while in his <i>Summa</i> he
is strongly influenced by Aristotle and working for a synthesis
of Aristotle and Augustine. Finally, in his philosophical
and scientific works, related to the genuine and
spurious works of Aristotle, “he goes very far with this
Arabian-trimmed Neo-Platonism, often so far that he finally
feels compelled to explain such exposition as mere citation,
and in the strife of conflicting masses of thought surging
within him refers for his own personal interpretation to his
theological writings.”<a id="FNanchor_1730" href="#Footnote_1730" class="fnanchor">[1730]</a> From this it would seem that most
of Albert’s theological treatises were written before his scientific
works, based upon Aristotle and spurious Arabic and
other additions. But we have seen that many of his Aristotelian
treatises were completed before the <i>Speculum naturale</i>
of Vincent of Beauvais, whereas his <i>Sentences</i> name
1246 and 1249 as current dates.<a id="FNanchor_1731" href="#Footnote_1731" class="fnanchor">[1731]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">His best
works are
those on
natural
science.</div>

<p>But while Albert may sometimes refer to his theological
works for his own personal views, he does not do so in those
passages which will especially concern us, and it is in his
works on natural science that he seems to the modern reader
more original. Indeed Jessen declared that repeated perusal
of Albert’s many writings in the field of natural history had
convinced him that he was “original everywhere, even where
he seems to copy.”<a id="FNanchor_1732" href="#Footnote_1732" class="fnanchor">[1732]</a> Jessen, indeed, held that Albert would
have been even more original and outspoken than he is, but
for fear of the charge of heresy; but in my opinion there is
little to support such a view. Be that as it may, in his works
on natural science Albert does not merely repeat past ideas
whether of Aristotle or others, but adds chapters of his own
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_532">[Pg 532]</span>
drawn in large measure from his own observation, experience,
and classification. It is in his scientific works that he
is as superior to Aquinas as the latter is generally considered
to surpass him in the purely metaphysical and theological
field. Since writing the foregoing sentences I have
found that Peter of Prussia expressed much the same view
in his life of Albert written toward the close of the fifteenth
century. Peter says, “Moreover, this should be understood,
that after Aristotle faith is to be put in Albert above all who
have written in philosophy, because he has himself illuminated
the writings of almost all philosophers and has seen
wherein they spoke truly or falsely, nay more, since he himself
was experienced above all others in natural phenomena.
It may be that some, relying on their metaphysics or logic,
can impugn him by certain arguments, but I think that no
matter of great concern, since Albert himself says that faith
is to be put in anyone who is expert in his art.”<a id="FNanchor_1733" href="#Footnote_1733" class="fnanchor">[1733]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Albert’s
fame in
the early
nineteenth
century.</div>

<p>Albert’s scientific fame perhaps reached its zenith shortly
before the publication of Darwin’s <i>Origin of Species</i> in
1859. In 1836 and 1837 Ernst Meyer published in <i>Linnaea</i><a id="FNanchor_1734" href="#Footnote_1734" class="fnanchor">[1734]</a>
his “Albertus Magnus, ein Beitrag zur Geschichte der Botanik
im XIII Jahrhundert,” and later in his <i>History of
Botany</i><a id="FNanchor_1735" href="#Footnote_1735" class="fnanchor">[1735]</a> ranked Albert as the greatest botanist during the
long period between Aristotle and Theophrastus on the one
hand and Andrea Cesalpini on the other. “Yes, more than
that. From Aristotle, the creator of scientific botany, until
his time this science sank deeper and deeper with time. With
him it arose like the Phoenix from its ashes. That, I think,
is praise enough, and this crown shall no one snatch away
from him.”<a id="FNanchor_1736" href="#Footnote_1736" class="fnanchor">[1736]</a> In the meantime, at Paris in 1853, Pouchet
had published his <i>History of the Natural Sciences in the
Middle Ages</i> with the sub-title, <i>Or Albertus Magnus and his
age considered as the point of departure of the experimental
school</i>.<a id="FNanchor_1737" href="#Footnote_1737" class="fnanchor">[1737]</a> But the extreme praise of Albert had occurred a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_533">[Pg 533]</span>
little earlier in lectures on the history of science delivered by
De Blainville at the Sorbonne in 1839-1841 and published
a few years later.<a id="FNanchor_1738" href="#Footnote_1738" class="fnanchor">[1738]</a> De Blainville too centered his discussion
of medieval science about Albert, to whom alone he devoted
some ninety pages, extolling him for affirming the permanence
of species and for “broadening” Aristotle to fit the requirements
of theology. In ten theses in which De Blainville
undertook to sum up briefly the chief legacies of Albert
to science, he held that he completed and terminated the
circle of human knowledge, adding to Aristotle the scientific
demonstration of the relations of man with God; that he extended
the scope of observation to every scientific field except
anatomy; that he created the description of natural bodies, a
thing unknown to the ancients; and that in filling in the gaps
in Aristotle’s writings he was the first to embrace all the
natural sciences in a complete plan, logical and perfectly
followed. “In accepting therefore with the Christian Aristotle,”
concluded De Blainville, “the first verse of <i>Genesis</i>,
‘In the beginning God created heaven and earth,’ and the consequences
which follow it, we have, in my opinion, reached
the <i>apogée</i> of the encyclopedia of human knowledge, which
can now only extend itself in respect to the number and the
deeper knowledge of material objects.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">A survival
of the

attitude.</div>

<p>This passage from De Blainville, who seems to have
been a Roman Catholic, is very interesting as showing how
the progress of modern science in his own time and the
centuries just preceding could be almost completely miscomprehended
by a professed historian of science. We
must not, however, suppose that such misconceptions of the
progress of science were universal or even general in the
first half of the nineteenth century. The article on Albertus
Magnus in the <i>Histoire Littéraire de la France</i>, which was
published in 1838, recognizes that Albert did not extend the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_534">[Pg 534]</span>
bounds of the sciences as much as had been supposed, and
that progress had been made since the sixteenth century
which rendered that part of his works “almost useless.”<a id="FNanchor_1739" href="#Footnote_1739" class="fnanchor">[1739]</a>
The passage from De Blainville is interesting also as showing
the same intimate connection presupposed between
Christian theology, natural science, and Aristotelianism as
in the days of the great Dominicans themselves. Again,
it reveals the extent to which natural science, since the
appearance of <i>The Origin of Species</i>, has tended to the
opposite extreme.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Recent
historians
of science
and
Albert.</div>

<p>As for historians of science, they have been rather
scarcer of late than in the earlier years of the nineteenth
century, when the subject seems to have had a great vogue
in France. Or at least the historians of science have been
less sympathetic with the distant past. Perhaps the inclination
has been to go almost as far toward the other pole of
neglect as De Blainville went toward that of extollation.
But the modern eulogies of the scientific attainments of
Roger Bacon, supposed to be a thorn in the side of the
medieval church and falsely regarded as its victim, and
as the one lone scientific spirit of the middle ages, have been
rather more absurd than the earlier praises of Albert, who
was represented both as a strong pillar in the church and
the backbone of medieval and Christian science. Indeed,
the <i>Histoire Littéraire</i>, in the same passage which we a
moment ago quoted against De Blainville, also states with
probable justification that Albert did “more than any other
doctor of his day” to introduce the natural sciences into the
course of public and private studies, and that it was his
taste for those subjects which won him his popular renown
and the homage of scholars until the end of the seventeenth
century. At no period, however, has Albert been entirely
without defenders. Jessen in 1867 regarded him as an
original natural scientist. Stadler in 1906 recognized that
“he made many independent observations, perhaps even carried
out experiments,” and showed great interest in biology.<a id="FNanchor_1740" href="#Footnote_1740" class="fnanchor">[1740]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_535">[Pg 535]</span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Albert’s
scientific
spirit.</div>

<p>Coming back from the opinions of others concerning
Albert to his own attitude towards natural science, it is to
be noted that, while he may make all sorts of mistakes
judged by modern standards, he does show unmistakable
signs of the scientific spirit. This will become more apparent
as we proceed, but for the present we may cite two
examples of it, and these from a work based upon a pseudo-Aristotelian
treatise and one which at first sight might seem
quite superstitious and unscientific to the modern reader,
since it is full of astrology, the <i>De causis et proprietatibus
elementorum et planetarum</i>.<a id="FNanchor_1741" href="#Footnote_1741" class="fnanchor">[1741]</a> In the first passage Albert repeats
the justification of natural science against a narrow
religious attitude which we heard from the lips of William
of Conches in the previous century. When Albert finds
that some men attribute the deluge simply to the divine will
and believe that no other cause for it should be sought, he
replies that he too ascribes it ultimately to the divine will,
but that he believes that God acts through natural causes
in the case of natural phenomena, and that, while he would
not presume to search the causes of the divine will, he does
feel free to investigate those natural causes which were the
divine instruments. A little further on in the same chapter
Albert declares that “it is not enough to know in terms of
universals, but we seek to know each object’s own peculiar
characteristics, for this is the best and perfect kind of
science.”<a id="FNanchor_1742" href="#Footnote_1742" class="fnanchor">[1742]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Philosophical
generalization
and
scientific
detail.</div>

<p>This desire for concrete, specific, detailed, accurate
knowledge concerning everything in nature is felt by Albert
in other of his writings to be scarcely in the spirit of the
Aristotelian natural philosophy which he follows and sets
forth in his parallel treatises. In his work on animals a
cleavage may be observed between those parts where Albert
discusses the general natures and common characteristics
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_536">[Pg 536]</span>
of animals and seems to follow Aristotle rather closely, and
those books where he lists and describes particular animals
with numerous allusions to recent experience and considerable
criticism of past authorities. At the beginning of his
twenty-second book he apologizes for listing particular animals
in alphabetical order, which is “not appropriate to
philosophy,” by saying that “we know we are debtors both
to the wise and to the unlearned, and those things which
are told in particular terms better instruct a rustic intelligence.”
But while this desire to describe particular objects
precisely is felt by Albert to be not in accord with traditional
philosophic methods of presentation, it is a desire which
many of his contemporaries share with him. At the beginning
of his sixth book on vegetables and plants, where
particular herbs and trees are listed, he explains, “In this
sixth book of vegetables we satisfy the curiosity of our students
rather than philosophy, for philosophy cannot deal
with particulars.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Medieval
interest
in nature.</div>

<p>This healthy interest in nature and commendable curiosity
concerning real things was not confined to Albert’s
students nor to “rustic intelligences.” One has only to
examine the sculpture of the great thirteenth century cathedrals
to see that the craftsmen of the towns were close observers
of the world of nature and that every artist was a
naturalist too. In the foliage that twines about the capitals
of the columns in French Gothic cathedrals it is easy to
recognize, says M. Mâle, a large number of plants: “the
plantain, arum, ranunculus, fern, clover, coladine, hepatica,
columbine, cress, parsley, strawberry-plant, ivy, snapdragon,
the flower of the broom and the leaf of the oak, a
typically French collection of flowers loved from childhood.”<a id="FNanchor_1743" href="#Footnote_1743" class="fnanchor">[1743]</a>
<i>Mutatis mutandis</i>, the same statement could be
made concerning the carved vegetation that runs riot in
Lincoln cathedral. “The thirteenth century sculptors sang
their <i>chant de mai</i>. All the spring delights of the Middle
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_537">[Pg 537]</span>
Ages live again in their work&mdash;the exhilaration of Palm
Sunday, the garlands of flowers, the bouquets fastened on
the doors, the strewing of fresh herbs in the chapels, the
magical flowers of the feast of Saint John&mdash;all the fleeting
charm of those old-time springs and summers. The Middle
Ages, so often said to have little love for nature, in point of
fact gazed at every blade of grass with reverence.”<a id="FNanchor_1744" href="#Footnote_1744" class="fnanchor">[1744]</a> But
it is not merely love of nature but scientific interest and accuracy
that we see revealed in the sculptures of the cathedrals
and in the note-book of the thirteenth century architect,
Villard de Honnecourt,<a id="FNanchor_1745" href="#Footnote_1745" class="fnanchor">[1745]</a> with its sketches of insect as
well as animal life, of a lobster, two parroquets on a perch,
the spirals of a snail’s shell, a fly, a dragonfly, and a grasshopper,
as well as a bear and a lion from life, and more
familiar animals such as the cat and swan. The sculptors
of gargoyles and chimeras were not content to reproduce
existing animals but showed their command of animal
anatomy by creating strange compound and hybrid monsters&mdash;one
might almost say, evolving new species&mdash;which nevertheless
have all the verisimilitude of copies from living
forms. It was these breeders in stone, these Burbanks of
the pencil, these Darwins with the chisel, who knew nature
and had studied botany and zoology in a way superior to
the scholar who simply pored over the works of Aristotle
and Pliny. No wonder that Albert’s students were curious
about particular things.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Albert’s
own
attitude.</div>

<p>But one is inclined to wonder whether the passage from
the <i>De causis et proprietatibus elementorum et planetarum</i>,
which we quoted first, may not have been written after the
passages which we have quoted from his works on plants
and animals, and whether Albert had come, thanks possibly
to that same stimulating scientific curiosity of his students,
to cease to apologize for the detailed description of particular
objects as unphilosophical and to praise it as “the best
and perfect kind of science.” At any rate it is those portions
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_538">[Pg 538]</span>
of his works on animals, plants, and minerals which he
devotes to such description of particular objects which
possess most independent value, and it is perhaps also worth
noting that Ptolemy of Lucca in looking back upon Albert’s
work seems not only to distinguish his writings on logic
and theology from those on nature, but also to imply a
distinction between Aristotle’s natural philosophy and his
“very well-known and most excellent contribution to the
experimental knowledge of things of nature.”<a id="FNanchor_1746" href="#Footnote_1746" class="fnanchor">[1746]</a> Ptolemy
seems to say Aristotle’s contribution, but the credit really
belongs largely to Albert and his students.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Albert and
modern
experimentation.</div>

<p>Pouchet was therefore not without justification in his
sub-title, “Or Albertus Magnus and his Period Considered
as the Beginning of the Experimental School.” His distinguishing,
however, three stages of scientific progress in
the history of civilization&mdash;the first, Greek, characterized
by observation, and represented especially by Aristotle; the
second, Roman, marked by erudition and typified by Pliny;
the third, medieval, distinguished by experimentation, and
having Albertus Magnus and Roger Bacon as its two great
representatives;&mdash;was rather too general and sweeping.
Galen, for instance, was a great experimenter and the ancient
Empirics put little trust in anything except experience.
Albert himself, in discussing “the serious problem” whether
life is possible in the Antipodes or southern hemisphere,
states that “the most powerful kings and the most accomplished
philosophers have labored over it from antiquity,
the kings forsooth by experiment and the philosophers by
rational inquiry.”<a id="FNanchor_1747" href="#Footnote_1747" class="fnanchor">[1747]</a> Moreover, neither Roger Bacon nor
Albert can be shown to have done much experimenting of
the sort, carefully planned and regulated, which is carried
on in modern laboratories. Meyer in his <i>History of Botany</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1748" href="#Footnote_1748" class="fnanchor">[1748]</a>
although Albert was a great favorite with him, felt constrained
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_539">[Pg 539]</span>
to renounce the credit for purposive experimentation
which Pouchet had given him. “How gladly would I
see this crown also placed deservedly upon my favorite’s
head!... But I do not know of his undertaking an experiment
in order to solve a physiological or physical problem
in which he had a clearly defined purpose and the suitable
materials at hand for carrying it out; his books on plants
certainly do not contain a single one.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Personal
observation
and
experience
of plants.</div>

<p>Albert’s work on plants does contain, however, many
passages in which he recognizes experience as a criterion of
truth or gives the results of his personal observations. Such
passages occur especially in the sixth book where he tries
to satisfy his students’ curiosity, but we may first note an
earlier passage where he recommends “making conjectures
and experiments” in order to learn the nature of trees in
general and of each variety of tree, herb, fruit, and fungus
in particular. Since, however, one can scarcely have personal
experience of them all, it is also advisable to read the
books which the experts (<i>experti</i>) of antiquity have written
on such matters.<a id="FNanchor_1749" href="#Footnote_1749" class="fnanchor">[1749]</a> But a mistrust of the assertions of others
often accompanies Albert’s reliance upon personal observation
and experience. Like Galen in his work on medicinal
simples, he explains in opening his sixth book that merely
to list the names of plants found in existing books would fill
a volume, and that he will limit his discussion to those native
varieties “better known among us.” Of some of these he
has had personal experience; for the others he follows
authors whom he has found unready to state anything unless
it was proved by experience. For experience alone is
reliable concerning particular natures. He cautions in regard
to a tree which is said to save doves from serpents,
“But this has not been sufficiently proved by certain experience,
like the other facts which are written here, but is found
in the writings of the ancients.”<a id="FNanchor_1750" href="#Footnote_1750" class="fnanchor">[1750]</a> Of another assertion he
remarks, “But this is proved by no experience”;<a id="FNanchor_1751" href="#Footnote_1751" class="fnanchor">[1751]</a> and of a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_540">[Pg 540]</span>
third he says, “As some affirm, but I have not tested this
myself.”<a id="FNanchor_1752" href="#Footnote_1752" class="fnanchor">[1752]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Experience
a
criterion
in zoology.</div>

<p>Personal observation and experience are equally, if not
more, noticeable in Albert’s work on animals. He proposes
to tell “what he knows by reason and what he sees by
experience of the natures of animals”; he adds that science
cannot be attained in all matters by demonstration, in some
cases one must resort to conjecture.<a id="FNanchor_1753" href="#Footnote_1753" class="fnanchor">[1753]</a> After listing various
remedies for the infirmities of falcons from the work on
falconry of the Emperor Frederick, he concludes, “Such are
the medicines which one finds given for falcons and the
experience of wise men, but the wise falconer will with time
add to or subtract from them according to his own experience
of what is beneficial to the state of health of the birds.
For experience is the best teacher in all matters of this
sort.”<a id="FNanchor_1754" href="#Footnote_1754" class="fnanchor">[1754]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Observations
of
Albert
and his
associates.</div>

<p>In the treatise on animals as in that on plants Albert’s
allusions to experience occur mainly in the last few books
where he describes particular animals. Here he often says,
“I have tested this,” or “I and my associates have experienced,”<a id="FNanchor_1755" href="#Footnote_1755" class="fnanchor">[1755]</a>
or “I have not experienced this,” or “I have proved
that this is not true.”<a id="FNanchor_1756" href="#Footnote_1756" class="fnanchor">[1756]</a> Like Alexander of Neckam he rejects
the story that the beaver castrates itself in order to
escape with its life from its hunters; Albert says that experience
near his home has often disproved this.<a id="FNanchor_1757" href="#Footnote_1757" class="fnanchor">[1757]</a> In discussing
whales he restricts himself entirely to the results
of his own observation, saying, “We pass over what the
Ancients have written on this topic because their statements
do not agree with experience.”<a id="FNanchor_1758" href="#Footnote_1758" class="fnanchor">[1758]</a> According to Pouchet<a id="FNanchor_1759" href="#Footnote_1759" class="fnanchor">[1759]</a>
Albert gives even more detailed information concerning
whales than do the Norse sagas, and also includes animals
of the north unknown to classical writers. He occasionally
reveals his nationality by giving the German as well as the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_541">[Pg 541]</span>
Latin names of animals, and he displays an acquaintance with
the fauna of surrounding countries such as Norway, Sweden,
Bohemia, and Carinthia.<a id="FNanchor_1760" href="#Footnote_1760" class="fnanchor">[1760]</a> He asserts that there are no eels
in the Danube and its tributaries, but that they abound in
the other rivers of Germany.<a id="FNanchor_1761" href="#Footnote_1761" class="fnanchor">[1761]</a> He tells of observing the
habits of eagles in Livonia,<a id="FNanchor_1762" href="#Footnote_1762" class="fnanchor">[1762]</a> or supports the account in
Solinus of a monstrous beast with fore legs like human
arms and hind legs like human legs by stating that he has
seen both male and female of the species captured in the
forests of Russia (<i>Sclaviae</i>).<a id="FNanchor_1763" href="#Footnote_1763" class="fnanchor">[1763]</a> Of his wide travels and observation
of natural phenomena we shall meet other examples
as we proceed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Experiments
with
animals.</div>

<p>Albert has not only observed animal life widely, he has
also performed experiments with animals as he apparently
did not do with plants. He and his associates, for instance,
have proved by experiment that a cicada goes on singing in
its breast for a long time after its head has been cut off.<a id="FNanchor_1764" href="#Footnote_1764" class="fnanchor">[1764]</a>
He also proved to his satisfaction that the turtle, although a
marine animal, would not drink sea water, unless possibly
fresh water which flowed into the sea, by experimenting with
a turtle in a vessel of water.<a id="FNanchor_1765" href="#Footnote_1765" class="fnanchor">[1765]</a> He has heard it said that
the ostrich eats and digests iron, but the many ostriches
to whom he has offered the metal have consistently declined
it, although they would devour with avidity stones and
bones cut into small bits.<a id="FNanchor_1766" href="#Footnote_1766" class="fnanchor">[1766]</a> Crude experiments these may
be, but they are at least purposive.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Past
authors
questioned.</div>

<p>Albert also often expresses doubt as to certain statements
concerning animals on the ground that they have not
been tested by experience, even if he has had no opportunity
to disprove them. And he draws a sharp distinction between
authors who state what they themselves have seen
and tested and those who appear simply to repeat rumor or
folk-lore. That there are any such birds as gryphons or
griffins, he believes is affirmed in story-books (<i>historiae</i>)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_542">[Pg 542]</span>
rather than supported by the experiments of philosophers
or arguments of philosophy.<a id="FNanchor_1767" href="#Footnote_1767" class="fnanchor">[1767]</a> The story found in the
<i>Physiologus</i> of the pelican’s restoring its young with its own
blood he also considers as “read in story-books rather than
proved philosophically by experience,”<a id="FNanchor_1768" href="#Footnote_1768" class="fnanchor">[1768]</a>&mdash;a criticism which
shows how mistaken those modern scholars have been who
have declared the Physiologus and Bestiaries representative
of the thirteenth century attitude towards nature. The accounts
of harpies which one reads are also according to
Albert “not based upon experience, but are the assertions
of men of no great authority.”<a id="FNanchor_1769" href="#Footnote_1769" class="fnanchor">[1769]</a> They are said to be
rapacious birds with crooked nails and human faces, and
when a harpy meets a man in the desert it is said to kill him,
but afterwards, when it sees by its reflection in the water
that its own face is human, it grieves all the rest of its life
for the man whom it has slain. “But these statements,” says
Albert, “have not been experienced and seem fabulous.
Such tales are told especially by a certain Adelinus” (perhaps
the Anglo-Saxon Aldhelm) “and Solinus and Jorach.”
Albert is particularly chary of accepting the assertions
of these last two authors, assuring us, anent their statement
that certain birds can fly unharmed through flames,
“These philosophers tell many lies and I think that this is
one of their lies.”<a id="FNanchor_1770" href="#Footnote_1770" class="fnanchor">[1770]</a> In yet other passages Albert calls one
or the other of them a liar.<a id="FNanchor_1771" href="#Footnote_1771" class="fnanchor">[1771]</a> He also sometimes rejects
statements of Pliny, once classing him with Solinus among
those who rehearse popular hearsay rather than disclose
scientific experience.<a id="FNanchor_1772" href="#Footnote_1772" class="fnanchor">[1772]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Instances
of
credulity.</div>

<p>Albert thus displays considerable independence in dealing
with past authorities. Yet at times statements in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_543">[Pg 543]</span>
earlier writers which seem absurd to us pass him unchallenged.
He is far, for example, from rejecting all of Pliny’s
marvelous assertions. He still believes that the little fish
<i>eschinus</i> can stop “a ship two hundred feet or more” in
length by clinging to its keel, so that neither wind nor art
nor violence can move it.<a id="FNanchor_1773" href="#Footnote_1773" class="fnanchor">[1773]</a> And he adds something to
Pliny’s tale of hunters who make good their escape to their
ship with the tiger’s cubs by throwing them one at a time
to the pursuing tigress, who takes each whelp back to her
lair before returning to the pursuit of the hunters.<a id="FNanchor_1774" href="#Footnote_1774" class="fnanchor">[1774]</a> Albert’s
emendation is that the hunters provide themselves with glass
spheres which they roll one at a time towards the pursuing
tigress.<a id="FNanchor_1775" href="#Footnote_1775" class="fnanchor">[1775]</a> Seeing her own reflection on a small scale in the
glass ball, she thinks it one of her cubs until she has vainly
tried to give it milk, when she discovers the fraud and bounds
after the hunters again. But a second and a third glass ball
deceive her temporarily as before, and so the hunters reach
their ship without having had to surrender any of the real
cubs. This imputation of singular stupidity to the tigress
should be kept in mind to set against other passages in
medieval writers where almost human sagacity is ascribed
to animals. Although in two or three preceding passages
Albert has refuted the doctrine of spontaneous generation of
animal life,<a id="FNanchor_1776" href="#Footnote_1776" class="fnanchor">[1776]</a> he attributes the following passage to Pliny
without adverse criticism.<a id="FNanchor_1777" href="#Footnote_1777" class="fnanchor">[1777]</a> “There is a worm shaped like
a star, as Pliny says, which shines like a star at night; but
it never appears except when after great clouds it predicts
clear weather.<a id="FNanchor_1778" href="#Footnote_1778" class="fnanchor">[1778]</a> He says that there is so much rigid cold in
this worm that it extinguishes fire like ice. And if a man’s
flesh is touched with its slime, all the hair falls off and what
it touches decays. And he says that they beget nothing,
nor is there male or female among them. Therefore they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_544">[Pg 544]</span>
are generated from decaying matter.” Albert also accepts
the story of the poisoned maiden sent to Alexander the
Great.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Incredible
“experiences.”</div>

<p>Albert also is unduly credulous of utterances about animals
supposed to be based upon experience, although he cannot
be called a mere empiricist, since he tries to test particular
statements by the general laws concerning living beings
which he has read in Aristotle or derived from his own experience
and reflection. He denies, for example, Pliny’s
statement that other animals are attracted by the pleasant
smell which the panther emits as it sleeps after overeating,
on the ground that man is the only animal who is pleased
or displeased by odors.<a id="FNanchor_1779" href="#Footnote_1779" class="fnanchor">[1779]</a> But it would seem that some of
the fishermen, fowlers, and hunters from whom he gleaned
bits of zoological information were not so trustworthy as
he imagined. He says that “a trustworthy person” told him
that he saw in an eagle’s nest three hundred ducks, over a
hundred geese, about forty hares, and many large fish, all
of which were required to satisfy the appetites of the young
eagles.<a id="FNanchor_1780" href="#Footnote_1780" class="fnanchor">[1780]</a> He also “heard from trustworthy persons” that a
serpent with the virgin countenance of a beardless man “was
slain in an island of Germany and there displayed in our
times to all who wished to see it until the flesh putrefied.”<a id="FNanchor_1781" href="#Footnote_1781" class="fnanchor">[1781]</a>
Such reports of mermaids and sea-serpents have still, however,
a certain currency. Experienced hunters said that
worms could be killed in any beast by suspending from its
neck a strip of citron (<i>sticados citrinum</i>) immediately after
it had been dried.<a id="FNanchor_1782" href="#Footnote_1782" class="fnanchor">[1782]</a> German artificers of Albert’s day told
him that the hyena bore a gem in its eyes, or more truly in
its forehead.<a id="FNanchor_1783" href="#Footnote_1783" class="fnanchor">[1783]</a> Albert sometimes has a tall story of his own
to tell. At Cologne in the presence of himself and many
associates a little girl of perhaps three years was exhibited
who, as soon as she was released from her mother’s hands,
ran to the corners of the room searching for spiders, “and
ate them all large and small, and flourished on this diet and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_545">[Pg 545]</span>
greatly preferred it to all other food.”<a id="FNanchor_1784" href="#Footnote_1784" class="fnanchor">[1784]</a> Albert also learned
by personal experience that moles gladly eat frogs and toads.
For once he saw a mole who held by the foot a big toad
which “cried loudly because of the mole’s bite.”<a id="FNanchor_1785" href="#Footnote_1785" class="fnanchor">[1785]</a> He also
found by experience that both frogs and toads would eat a
dead mole. In affirming that the custom of killing off the
old men is still prevalent within the borders of Saxony and
Poland, Albert says, “As I have seen with my own eyes”;
but really all that he has seen is the graves of their fathers
which the sons have shown to him.<a id="FNanchor_1786" href="#Footnote_1786" class="fnanchor">[1786]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Minerals
and experience.</div>

<p>Albert’s general attitude towards past authorities and
present experience remains the same in his treatise on
minerals. He will give the names of the important gems
and state their virtues as known from authorities and experience,
but he will not repeat everything that has been said
about precious stones because it is not profitable for science.
“For natural science is not simply receiving what one is
told, but the investigation of causes in natural phenomena.”<a id="FNanchor_1787" href="#Footnote_1787" class="fnanchor">[1787]</a>
Concerning metals, too, he intends to state “rationally either
what has been handed down by the philosophers or what I
myself have experienced.”<a id="FNanchor_1788" href="#Footnote_1788" class="fnanchor">[1788]</a> He adds that once he wandered
far in exile to places rich in mines in order that he might
test the natures of metals. “And for this same reason I investigated
the transmutation of metals among the alchemists,
in order that I might observe something of the nature and
characteristics of the metals.” In a later chapter he alludes
to workers in copper “in our parts, namely, Paris and
Cologne, and in other places where I have been and seen
things tested by experience.”<a id="FNanchor_1789" href="#Footnote_1789" class="fnanchor">[1789]</a> <i>Fui et vidi experiri</i>, such
is Albert the Great’s peaceful paraphrase, probably unintentional,
for warring Caesar’s <i>Veni, vidi, vici</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Minerals
and
credulity.</div>

<p>Again, also, in the treatise on minerals, reliance upon
experience proves to be no sure guarantee against incorrect
notions, credulity, and unquestioning trust in authority.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_546">[Pg 546]</span>
Albert still repeats<a id="FNanchor_1790" href="#Footnote_1790" class="fnanchor">[1790]</a> the old notion that “adamant,” hard
as it is, is softened and dissolved by the blood and flesh of a
goat, especially if the goat for some time before has been
fed on a diet of certain herbs and wine.<a id="FNanchor_1791" href="#Footnote_1791" class="fnanchor">[1791]</a> He adds that this
property of goat’s blood makes it beneficial for sufferers
from stone in the bladder. Albert repeats with a qualifying
“It is said” the statement that the emerald comes from the
nests of gryphons or griffins,<a id="FNanchor_1792" href="#Footnote_1792" class="fnanchor">[1792]</a> but he does not stop to deny
the existence of those birds, as we have heard him do elsewhere.
He adds, however, as to the source of the emerald
that “a truthful and curious experimenter coming from
Greece” had said that it was produced in rocks under the
sea. This expression, “curious experimenter” (<i>curiosus experimentator</i>),
or perhaps better “inquisitive observer,”
Albert also applied to one of his associates who saw Frederick
II’s peculiar magnet.<a id="FNanchor_1793" href="#Footnote_1793" class="fnanchor">[1793]</a> In the present discussion of the
emerald he adds that experience in his own time has proved
that this stone, “if good and true,” cannot endure sexual
intercourse, so that the reigning king of Hungary, who was
wearing an emerald upon his finger when he went in to his
wife, broke it into three pieces. “And that is probably why
they say that this stone inclines its wearer to chastity.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tale of
a toad
and an
emerald.</div>

<p>Albert, however, had told as a personal experience a
stranger tale than this of an emerald in his work on vegetables
and plants in order to illustrate “the many effects of
stones and plants which are known by experience and by
which wonders are worked.” But as a matter of fact, the
incident is concerned not with an emerald and a plant, but
an emerald and a toad, an animal which one would infer
was in Albert’s day often the subject of experiment.</p>

<p>“An emerald was recently seen among us, small in size
but marvelous in beauty. When its virtue was to be tested,
someone stepped forth and said that, if a circle was made
about a toad with the emerald and then the stone was set
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_547">[Pg 547]</span>
before the toad’s eyes, one of two things would happen.
Either the stone, if of weak virtue, would be broken by the
gaze of the toad; or the toad would burst, if the stone was
possessed of full natural vigor. Without delay things were
arranged as he bade; and after a short lapse of time, during
which the toad kept its eye unswervingly upon the gem, the
latter began to crack like a nut and a portion of it flew from
the ring. Then the toad, which had stood immovable hitherto,
withdrew as if it had been freed from the influence of
the gem.”<a id="FNanchor_1794" href="#Footnote_1794" class="fnanchor">[1794]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Experience
versus
Aristotle.</div>

<p>In the incident just narrated Albert was perhaps tricked
by some traveling magician. But let us conclude our discussion
of his general scientific method by some more
rational instances of personal observation and experience.
In his treatise on meteorology his discussion of the rainbow,
which occupies some twenty-four pages of Borgnet’s text,<a id="FNanchor_1795" href="#Footnote_1795" class="fnanchor">[1795]</a>
is especially based upon experience and full of allusions to
it&mdash;a very interesting fact in view of the large space which
the discussion of the rainbow occupies in Roger Bacon’s
better known eulogy of experimental science. Albert recounts
his own observations when sailing over great waves
or when looking down from the top of a castle built upon
a high mountain, “and the time when this was seen was in
the morning after a rainy night, and it was in the autumn
with the sun in the sign of Virgo.” Albert takes exception
to Aristotle’s assertion that rainbows caused by the moon at
night appear only twice in fifty years. He and many others
have seen a bow at night, and “truthful experimenters have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_548">[Pg 548]</span>
found by experience” (<i>veridici experimentatores experti
sunt</i>) that a rainbow has appeared twice at night in the
same year. Nor can Albert conceive of any astronomical
reason why it should appear only twice in fifty years. “And
so I think that Aristotle stated this from the opinions of
others and not from the truth of demonstration or experience,
while those facts which have been adduced against his
statement have been experienced beyond a doubt by myself
and by other reliable investigators associated with me.” The
very chapter headings of this portion of Albert’s treatise
suggest an antithesis between the ancient authorities and
recent experimental investigation, for instance: “Of the
Iris of the Moon and what Ancients have said of it and
what Moderns have tested by experience,”<a id="FNanchor_1796" href="#Footnote_1796" class="fnanchor">[1796]</a> and “A Digression
stating Seneca’s views concerning <i>virgae</i> and experiments
with certain arcs seen in modern times.”<a id="FNanchor_1797" href="#Footnote_1797" class="fnanchor">[1797]</a> Thus
while Albert of course believes that the statements of many
of his authorities are based upon experience, he seems to
feel that he and his associates have founded an important
modern school for the investigation of nature at first hand.
We may choose to regard it as a mere school of observation,
but he dignifies its members by the title of <i>experimentatores</i>.
Again therefore we may admit that Pouchet
was not unjustified in associating Albert with the modern
experimental school.</p>

<h4 id="HIS_ALLUSIONS">III. <i>His Allusions to Magic</i></h4>

<p>At the close of his story of the toad and the emerald
Albert adds that there are many other such virtues of stones
and plants which are learned by experience, and that
magicians investigate the same and work wonders by them.
It is therefore quite appropriate for us to turn directly from
his attitude to experimental method to his conception of
magic. Like William of Auvergne he hints at an association
between the two. His pupil and contemporary, Ulrich
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_549">[Pg 549]</span>
Engelbert of Strasburg, actually called him “expert in
magic.”<a id="FNanchor_1798" href="#Footnote_1798" class="fnanchor">[1798]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Peter of
Prussia on
Albert’s
occult
science.</div>

<p>In his <i>Life of Albert</i> Peter of Prussia not only is evidently
concerned to make him out a saint as well as a scientist,
telling of his devotion to the Eucharist<a id="FNanchor_1799" href="#Footnote_1799" class="fnanchor">[1799]</a> and the Virgin
Mary and the wood of the Holy Cross<a id="FNanchor_1800" href="#Footnote_1800" class="fnanchor">[1800]</a> and of the miraculous
visions which he had from childhood, in which the
Virgin and the Apostle Paul appeared to him,<a id="FNanchor_1801" href="#Footnote_1801" class="fnanchor">[1801]</a> and how he
advanced more in knowledge by prayer than by study and
labor,<a id="FNanchor_1802" href="#Footnote_1802" class="fnanchor">[1802]</a> and that he read the Psalter through daily.<a id="FNanchor_1803" href="#Footnote_1803" class="fnanchor">[1803]</a> He also
devotes a number of chapters<a id="FNanchor_1804" href="#Footnote_1804" class="fnanchor">[1804]</a> to a defense of Albert against
the charge of having indulged in occult sciences, and of having
been “too curious concerning natural phenomena.”<a id="FNanchor_1805" href="#Footnote_1805" class="fnanchor">[1805]</a>
Peter explains that many superstitions were rife in Albert’s
time and that nigromancers were fascinating the people by
their false miracles, and pretending that their sorcery was
worked by the sciences of astronomy, mathematics, and
alchemy.<a id="FNanchor_1806" href="#Footnote_1806" class="fnanchor">[1806]</a> It was therefore essential that some man who was
equally learned and devout should thoroughly examine these
sciences, proving what was good in them and rejecting what
was bad.<a id="FNanchor_1807" href="#Footnote_1807" class="fnanchor">[1807]</a> Peter is inclined to be disingenuous in stating
Albert’s attitude toward some of the occult sciences, especially
the engraving of stones with images according to the
aspects of the stars, which he misrepresents Albert as prohibiting,
whereas Albert really calls it a good doctrine, as
we shall show later. Peter however states “how useful it is
to know natural and occult phenomena in the nature of
things, and that those who write about such things are to be
praised for it.”<a id="FNanchor_1808" href="#Footnote_1808" class="fnanchor">[1808]</a> Also “that it is useful and necessary to
know the facts of nature even if they are indecent.”<a id="FNanchor_1809" href="#Footnote_1809" class="fnanchor">[1809]</a> Later
on, towards the close of his book, Peter denies various feats
of magic that by his time had come to be popularly recounted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_550">[Pg 550]</span>
of Albert, and then does his best to make up for the subtracted
marvels by himself inventing many pious miracles
in which he would have us believe Albert was concerned.<a id="FNanchor_1810" href="#Footnote_1810" class="fnanchor">[1810]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Trithemius
on Albert’s
study
of magic.</div>

<p>The learned Trithemius (1462-1516), abbot of Sponheim,
in a letter to John Westenburgh in which he defends
himself against the charge of magic, admits that he “cannot
say that he is entirely ignorant of natural magic,” a form
of wisdom which he regards very highly; and adduces in
his justification the example of “Albertus Magnus, that
most learned man and among the saints truly most saintly,
of the profoundest intellect, worthy of eternal memory, who
scrutinized the depths of natural philosophy, and learned
to know marvels unheard of by others.”<a id="FNanchor_1811" href="#Footnote_1811" class="fnanchor">[1811]</a> Even to this day,
continues Trithemius, he is unjustly regarded by the unlearned
as a magician and devotee of superstition. For he
was not ignorant of the magic of nature, and he had innocently
read and mastered a great number of superstitious
books by depraved men. For not the knowledge but the
practice of evil is evil. Trithemius admits that he himself
has read many books of superstitious and even diabolical
magic, but contends that this is necessary, if one is to learn
to distinguish natural from illicit magic.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Magnus
in magia.</i></div>

<p>The brief but sane estimate of Albertus Magnus published
eighty years ago in the <i>Histoire Littéraire de la France</i>, from
which we have already had occasion to quote regarding his
importance in the history of natural science, mentions the
efforts of Trithemius and Naudé to defend him from the
charge of magic, but adds that even his panegyrists have
called him “great in magic, greater in philosophy, greatest
in theology,” and agrees that he frequently shows a leaning
towards the occult sciences. “He is an alchemist, he is an
astrologer, he believes in enchantments; he delights like
most savants of his age in explaining all phenomena that
surprise him by supernatural causes.” This rough characterization
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_551">[Pg 551]</span>
contains much truth, although it is hardly true
that Albert gave supernatural explanations for strange natural
phenomena. Rather he believed in occult forces and
marvels in nature which we no longer credit. We also have
already stated it as our opinion that he was really much
greater as a natural scientist than as a theologian. But we
have now to examine what grounds there are for calling
him <i>magnus in magia</i>, and <i>in magicis expertus</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His varying
treatment
of
magic.</div>

<p>Magic is often mentioned by Albert, both in his Biblical
and Aristotelian commentaries, both in his theological writings
and his works on natural science. Some references to
magic arts, occurring chiefly in the Biblical commentaries, are
too brief, incidental, and perfunctory to afford any particular
information.<a id="FNanchor_1812" href="#Footnote_1812" class="fnanchor">[1812]</a> The other passages seem scarcely consistent
with one another and will require separate treatment. We
shall first consider those in which Albert more or less adheres
to the traditional Christian attitude of condemnation
of magic as criminal and dealing with demons, of recognition
of its marvels but jealous differentiation of them from
divine miracle. It should be observed that all such passages
occur in his theological writings and that in them he does
little more than rehearse opinions which we have already
encountered in the writings of the early Christian fathers
with a few additional citations from books of necromancy
or from Arabic works on natural science such as those of
Algazel and Avicenna.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reality
of magic.</div>

<p>Albert has no doubt either in his scientific or religious
writings that marvels can be worked by magic. It is true
that one of its departments, <i>praestigia</i>, has to do with illusions
and juggleries in which things are made to appear to
exist which have no reality. But it also performs actual transformations.<a id="FNanchor_1813" href="#Footnote_1813" class="fnanchor">[1813]</a>
But even the actual performances of magic are
deceptive in that demons by their means lead human souls
astray, which is far worse than merely to deceive the eye.<a id="FNanchor_1814" href="#Footnote_1814" class="fnanchor">[1814]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_552">[Pg 552]</span></p><div class="sidenote">Magic due
to demons.</div>

<p>Albert affirms in his theological <i>Summa</i> that it is the consensus
of opinion that magic is due to demons. “For the
saints expressly say so, and it is the common opinion of all
persons, and it is taught in that part of necromancy which
deals with images and rings and mirrors of Venus and seals
of demons by Achot Graecus and Grema of Babylon and
Hermes of Egypt, and invocations for this purpose are described
in the book of Hermogenes and Philetus, the necromancers,
and in the book called the Almandel of Solomon.”<a id="FNanchor_1815" href="#Footnote_1815" class="fnanchor">[1815]</a>
In his <i>Commentary on the Sentences</i><a id="FNanchor_1816" href="#Footnote_1816" class="fnanchor">[1816]</a> Albert declares that
to make use of “magic virtues” is evil and apostasy from
the Faith, whether one openly resorts to “invocations, conjurations,
sacrifices, suffumigations, and adorations,” or to
some simple operation which none the less requires demon
aid for its performance. One must beware even of “mathematical
virtues,” that is, of astrological forces, especially in
“images, rings, mirrors, and characters,” lest the practice
of idolatry be introduced. In commenting upon the passage
in the gospel where the Pharisees accuse Christ of casting
out demons through the prince of demons, Albert admits
that necromancers are able to cast out demons and to restrain
them from doing external damage, but holds that they cannot
like Christ restrain the evil spirits from inciting inward
sin.<a id="FNanchor_1817" href="#Footnote_1817" class="fnanchor">[1817]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Magic and
miracle.</div>

<p>Albert will not admit, however, that the marvels of
magic compare with divine miracles. For one thing, feats
of magic do not even happen as instantaneously as miracles,
although they occur much more rapidly than the ordinary
processes of nature. But except for this difference in speed
the works of magic can usually be explained as the product
of natural forces, and by the fact that the demons are aided
in their operations by the influence of the stars. To change
rods into snakes, for instance, as Pharaoh’s magicians did,
is simply hastening the process by which worms generate
in decaying trees. Indeed, Albert is inclined to believe
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_553">[Pg 553]</span>
that the demons “produce no permanent substantial form
that would not easily be produced by putrefaction.”<a id="FNanchor_1818" href="#Footnote_1818" class="fnanchor">[1818]</a> The
magic power of fascination is after all only analogous to the
virtue of the sapphire in curing ulcers or of the emerald in
restraining sexual passion. Albert adds the comforting
thought that neither fascination nor the magic art can harm
anyone who has firm faith in God, but for us the most important
thing to note is that even in his theological writings
he has associated magic with natural forces and the stars
as well as with demons. In this he resembles William of
Auvergne rather than the early Christian fathers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Good
magic of
the Magi.</div>

<p>Like some other Christian commentators, Albert exempts
the Magi of the gospel story, who followed the star to
Bethlehem, from the category of magicians in the evil sense
that we have just heard him define magic. In his commentary
upon the gospel by Matthew he asserts that “the Magi
are not sorcerers (<i>malefici</i>) as some wrongly think.” He
also affirms that there is a difference between a Magus and
a <i>mathematicus</i> or an enchanter or necromancer or <i>ariolus</i>
or <i>aruspex</i> or diviner. Like Isidore Albert adopts the incorrect
etymology of connecting Magus and <i>magnus</i>. But
for him the Magi are not so called on account of the magnitude
of their sins. “Etymologically the Magi are great men”
whose knowledge of, or conjecture from, the inevitable processes
of cause and effect in nature often enables them to
predict or produce marvels of nature. In his commentary
on the Book of Daniel Albert quotes Jerome’s similar description
of them as “masters who philosophize about the
universe; moreover, the Magi are more particularly called
astronomers who search the future in the stars.” It is interesting
to note that this view of the Magi still persists
among Roman Catholics; the recent Catholic Encyclopedia
still insists concerning the wise men who came to Bethlehem,
“Neither were they magicians: the good meaning of
μάγοι, though found nowhere else in the Bible, is demanded
by the context of the second chapter of Matthew.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_554">[Pg 554]</span>
But here is a still more interesting point to note: Albertus
Magnus does not deny that the Magi were magicians. To
contend that Magi were not <i>magi</i> was a contradiction of
terms that was probably too much for his common sense.
All that he tries to do is to exculpate them from the practice
of those particular evil, superstitious, and diabolical
occult arts which Isidore and others had included in their
definitions of magic. From evil witchcraft and necromancy
and fatalistic astrology, from augury and liver divination,
from the arts of <i>sortilegi</i> and <i>pythones</i>, of enchanters “who
by means of certain incantations perform certain feats with
beasts or herbs or stones or images,” or of diviners who
employ geomancy or “the chance of fire” or hydromancy or
aerimancy: from all such practices he acquits them. “They
were not devoted to any of these arts, but only to magic as
it has been described. And this is praiseworthy.”<a id="FNanchor_1819" href="#Footnote_1819" class="fnanchor">[1819]</a> Thus
Albert not merely defends the Magi, he praises magic; and
we begin to see the fitness of the epithet, <i>Magnus in magia</i>,
as applied to him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Natural
magic.</div>

<p>But how does this praiseworthy magic differ from the
magic which he condemned in his <i>Summa</i> and commentary
on the Sentences? Presumably in that its objects are good
not evil, and that it does not make any use of demons. It
would seem to resemble closely the natural magic of William
of Auvergne. It is like evil magic in that both employ the
forces of nature and the influences of the stars, but it is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_555">[Pg 555]</span>
unlike it in that it employs them exclusively and is free from
any resort to demons and also apparently from the use of
incantations or the superstitious devices of geomancers and
other diviners.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Attitude
in the
scientific
treatises.</div>

<p>If in his theological writings Albert thus distinguishes
two varieties of magic, one good and one evil, one demoniacal
and one natural, we need not be surprised if in his scientific
treatises, where he is influenced mainly by Arabian
astrology, the pseudo-Aristotelian treatises, the Hermetic
literature, and other such writings rather than by patristic
literature, he introduces yet a third conception of magic,
which scarcely agrees with either of the others and yet has
features in common with both. He nowhere in his commentaries
on Aristotle or other works of natural science really
stops and discusses magic at any length. But there are a
number of brief and incidental allusions to it which imply
that it is a distinct and definite branch of knowledge of
which, although he himself does not treat, he gives no sign
of disapproval. He also cites even enchanters and necromancers
without offering any apology, and now seems to
regard as sub-divisions of magic those occult arts from
which we have just heard him exculpate the Magi.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Use of
animals
and herbs
in magic.</div>

<p>In his treatise on animals Albert states that anointing
a sleeper’s temples with the blood of a hoopoe makes him
see terrible dreams, and that enchanters value highly the
brain, tongue, and heart of this bird. He adds, “But we
shall not discuss this matter here, for the investigation of
it belongs to another science,”&mdash;presumably to magic.<a id="FNanchor_1820" href="#Footnote_1820" class="fnanchor">[1820]</a> In
his treatise on plants he says that certain herbs seem to have
“divine effects”<a id="FNanchor_1821" href="#Footnote_1821" class="fnanchor">[1821]</a> which those who study magic follow up
further. Examples are the betony, said to confer the power
of divination, the verbena, used as a love charm, and the
herb <i>meropis</i>, supposed to open closed seas, and many other
such plants listed in the books of incantations of Hermes
the philosopher and of Costa ben Luca the philosopher and
in the books of physical ligatures. “Enchanter” (<i>Incantator</i>),
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_556">[Pg 556]</span>
apparently the author or title of a book, is cited more
than once for the virtues of herbs, and what enchanters in
general say is also mentioned.<a id="FNanchor_1822" href="#Footnote_1822" class="fnanchor">[1822]</a> “According to the testimony
of the <i>praestigia</i> of the magi” the juice of a certain
herb drunk in water makes a person do or say whatever the
magician says or does.<a id="FNanchor_1823" href="#Footnote_1823" class="fnanchor">[1823]</a> Students of magic believe that the
seed of another herb extinguishes lust.<a id="FNanchor_1824" href="#Footnote_1824" class="fnanchor">[1824]</a> Necromancers
avow that betony indicates the future when plucked with
an adjuration of Aesculapius,<a id="FNanchor_1825" href="#Footnote_1825" class="fnanchor">[1825]</a> and students of necromancy
say that a man invoking demons should have a character
painted on him with the herb Jusquiam,<a id="FNanchor_1826" href="#Footnote_1826" class="fnanchor">[1826]</a> and that gods invoked
by characters and seals and sacrifices present themselves
more readily if frankincense is offered them.<a id="FNanchor_1827" href="#Footnote_1827" class="fnanchor">[1827]</a> Such
passages seem to indicate that Albert regarded occult virtues
as largely the concern of magic, but that at least in necromancy
the invocation of gods and demons also enters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Magic
stones.</div>

<p>Many allusions to magic occur in Albert’s treatise on
minerals, as the especially marvelous powers attributed to
gems in antiquity might well lead us to expect. The magi,
he tells us, make much use of the stone <i>diacodos</i>, which is
said to excite phantasms but loses its virtue if it touches
a corpse.<a id="FNanchor_1828" href="#Footnote_1828" class="fnanchor">[1828]</a> But such things do not come within Albert’s
present scope; he refers the reader for further information
to the books of magic of Hermes, Ptolemy, and Thebith ben
Chorath. The stone magnet is also stated in the magic books
to have a marvelous power of producing phantasms, especially
if consecrated with an adjuration and a character.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Magic
images
engraved
on gems.</div>

<p>Albert twice assures us that the “prodigious and marvelous”
powers of stones, and more particularly of images and
seals engraved on stones, cannot be really understood without
a knowledge of the three other sciences of magic, necromancy,
and astrology.<a id="FNanchor_1829" href="#Footnote_1829" class="fnanchor">[1829]</a> He therefore will not in this treatise
on minerals discuss the subject as fully as he might, “since
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_557">[Pg 557]</span>
those powers cannot be proved by physical laws (<i>principiis
physicis</i>), but require a knowledge of astronomy and magic
and the necromantic sciences, which should be considered
in other treatises.”<a id="FNanchor_1830" href="#Footnote_1830" class="fnanchor">[1830]</a> For the reason why gems were first
so engraved he refers his readers to “the science of the <i>magi</i>
which Magor Graecus and Germa of Babylon and Hermes
the Egyptian were among the first to perfect, and in which
later wise Ptolemy was a marvelous light and Geber of
Spain; Tebith, too, handed down a full treatment of the
art.”<a id="FNanchor_1831" href="#Footnote_1831" class="fnanchor">[1831]</a> And in this science it is a fundamental principle that
all things produced by nature or art are influenced by celestial
virtues. Thus we comprehend the close connection of
astrology and magic. As for necromancy, the third “science”
involved, Albert’s associates are curious to know the
doctrine of images even if it is necromancy, and Albert does
not hesitate to assure them that it is a good doctrine in any
case. Yet in his theological writings he not only condemned
necromancy, but declared the art of images to be evil “because
it inclines to idolatry by imputing divinity to the stars,
and ... is employed for idle or evil ends.”<a id="FNanchor_1832" href="#Footnote_1832" class="fnanchor">[1832]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Magic and
alchemy;
finding
hidden
metals.</div>

<p>Albert again refers to magic in his discussion of alchemy
in the treatise on minerals, where he not only cites Hermes
a great deal but refers to writings by Avicenna on magic
and alchemy.<a id="FNanchor_1833" href="#Footnote_1833" class="fnanchor">[1833]</a> Albert holds that it is not the business
of a physical or natural scientist (<i>physicus</i>) to determine
concerning the transmutation of metals; that is the affair
of the art of alchemy, which thus seems to lie outside the
field of natural science upon the borders of magic. Similarly
the problem in what places and mountains and by what
signs metals are discovered falls partly within the sphere
of natural science and partly belongs to that magical science
which has to do with finding hidden treasure. Albert perhaps
has the employment of the divining rod in mind.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fascination
and
magic.</div>

<p>The occult virtue of the human mind is another matter
which Albert seems inclined to place within the field of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_558">[Pg 558]</span>
magic. In the treatise on minerals<a id="FNanchor_1834" href="#Footnote_1834" class="fnanchor">[1834]</a> he remarks that whether
fascination is true or not is a question for magic to settle,
and in his <i>On Sleep and Waking</i><a id="FNanchor_1835" href="#Footnote_1835" class="fnanchor">[1835]</a> he cites Avicenna and
Algazel as adducing “fascination and magic virtues” as
examples of occult influence exerted by one man over another.
It will be remembered that he cited the same authors
anent fascination in his Commentary on the Sentences,<a id="FNanchor_1836" href="#Footnote_1836" class="fnanchor">[1836]</a> but
there denied that fascination or magic could harm anyone
who had firm faith in God, although he illustrated the possibility
of potent human occult virtue exercised at will by the
marvelous virtues exerted constantly by the sapphire and
emerald. Peter of Prussia gives us to understand that
Albert’s belief was that fascination did not operate naturally
but by the aid of demons; nevertheless certain men are generated
at rare intervals who work marvels like the twins in
Germany in Albert’s time at whose approach bolts would
open.<a id="FNanchor_1837" href="#Footnote_1837" class="fnanchor">[1837]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Interpretation
of
dreams
and magic.</div>

<p>Albert also regards the interpretation of dreams as especially
the affair of magic. In one passage of <i>On Sleep
and Waking</i><a id="FNanchor_1838" href="#Footnote_1838" class="fnanchor">[1838]</a> he grants that probably the art of interpreting
dreams cannot be acquired without a knowledge of magic
and “astronomy.” In a second passage<a id="FNanchor_1839" href="#Footnote_1839" class="fnanchor">[1839]</a> he speaks of the
magicians as teaching the interpretation of dreams and the
“astronomers” as talking of signs of prophecies, but not
the sort of prophecy accepted among theologians. In a
third passage<a id="FNanchor_1840" href="#Footnote_1840" class="fnanchor">[1840]</a> he defines the kind of dreams “which wise
men interpret and for which was invented the art of interpretation
in the magical sciences.” Albert seems to have no
particular objection, either moral or religious, to the interpretation
of dreams, even if it is a branch of magic. Rather
he censures Aristotle and other philosophers for not having
investigated this side of the subject further, and he thinks
that by physical science alone one can at least determine
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_559">[Pg 559]</span>
what sort of dreams are of value for purposes of divination
and are susceptible to interpretation.<a id="FNanchor_1841" href="#Footnote_1841" class="fnanchor">[1841]</a> Magicians make great
use not only of dreams but also of visions seen when one is
awake but with the senses distracted.<a id="FNanchor_1842" href="#Footnote_1842" class="fnanchor">[1842]</a> The magicians indeed
specialize in potions which clog and stupefy the senses,
and thereby produce apparitions by means of which they
predict the future.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Magic and
divination.</div>

<p>In this same treatise <i>On Sleep and Waking</i> Albert lists
together “the astronomer and augur and magician and interpreter
of dreams and visions and every such diviner.”<a id="FNanchor_1843" href="#Footnote_1843" class="fnanchor">[1843]</a> He
admits that almost all men of this type delight in deception
and are poorly educated and confuse what is contingent with
what is necessary, but he insists that “the defect is not in
the science but in those who abuse it.” Thus magic and
divination in general are closely associated.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Summary
of Albert’s
accounts
of magic.</div>

<p>This last passage, like the connecting of enchanters and
necromancers with magic which we have noted in a previous
paragraph, is hard to reconcile with the passage in his commentary
upon the Gospel of Matthew where Albert separated
the Magi and magic from diviners, enchanters, necromancers,
and their arts. So far as mere classification is concerned,
Albert’s references to magic in his scientific writings are in
closer accord with his discussion of magic in the <i>Summa</i>
and Sentences, where too he associated magic with the stars,
with occult virtues, with fascination, and with images. But
the emphasis which he there laid upon the evil character
of magic and its connection with demons is now almost
entirely lacking. Our attention is rather being continually
called to how closely magic, or at least some parts of it,
border upon natural science and astronomy. And yet we
are also always being reminded that magic, although itself
a “science,” is essentially different in methods and results
from natural science or at least from what Albert calls
“physical science.” Overlapping both these fields, apparently,
and yet rather distinct from both in Albert’s thought,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_560">[Pg 560]</span>
is the great subject of “astronomy” which includes both
the genuine natural science and the various vagaries of
astrology. It is all like some map of a feudal area where
certain fiefs owe varying degrees of fealty to, or are claimed
by, several lords and where the frontiers are loose, fluctuating,
and uncertain. Perhaps the rule of the stars can be
made to account for almost everything in natural science
or in magic, but Albert seems inclined to leave room for the
independent action of divine power, the demons, and the
human mind and will. But his attitude to the stars and to
astrology will be considered more fully later; we shall first
examine in more detail his own attitude towards marvelous
virtues in inferior nature and towards some of the other
matters which he has located expressly or by implication
along the ill-defined frontier of “magic and astronomy.”
In concluding the present section let us make the one further
observation that while Albert describes magic differently
and even inconsistently in different passages, it is evident
enough that he is trying to describe the same thing all the
time.</p>

<h4 id="MARVELOUS_VIRTUES">IV. <i>Marvelous Virtues in Nature</i></h4>

<div class="sidenote">Properties
of the
lion.</div>

<p>So many instances have already been given from other
authors of the occult virtues ascribed to parts of animals
that we shall note in Albert’s treatise on animals only
two or three passages, chiefly for purposes of comparison.
The properties which he ascribes to the carcass of the lion,<a id="FNanchor_1844" href="#Footnote_1844" class="fnanchor">[1844]</a>
for instance, bear a certain resemblance to Pliny’s paragraph
on its medicinal virtues and to Thomas of Cantimpré’s
compilation concerning it, yet are considerably different.
Its fat is hotter than that of other animals, and they flee
from anyone who is anointed with it, while fumigation
therewith keeps wolves away from sheep. A diet of lion’s
flesh benefits paralytics. Garments wrapped in its skin are
secure from moths, and the hair falls out of a wolf’s skin
which is left near a lion’s skin. If the tooth of a lion which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_561">[Pg 561]</span>
is called <i>caninus</i> is suspended about a boy’s neck before he
loses his first teeth, he will be free from toothache when
his second teeth come. Lion’s fat mixed with other unguents
removes blotches, and rubbing cancer with its blood cures
that disease. Drinking a little of its gall cures jaundice;
its liver in wine checks pain in the liver. Its brain, if eaten,
causes madness; but remedies deafness, if inserted in the
ear with some strong oil. Its testicle, administered pulverized
with roses, causes sterility&mdash;a case, it would seem,
of sympathetic magic operating by contraries. But no doctrine
of sympathy and antipathy is needed to explain the
further assertion that its excrement drunk with wine makes
one abhor wine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nasty
recipes:
illusory
lights.</div>

<p>The last two items are very characteristic of Albert’s
section on quadrupeds, where the medicinal and other properties
of such parts as <i>stercus</i>, <i>virga</i>, and <i>testiculus</i> are incessantly
mentioned, and are sometimes used in charms, as
in the following: “Si virga lupi in alicuius nomine viri vel
mulieris ligetur, non poterit coire donec nodus ille solutus
fuerit.”<a id="FNanchor_1845" href="#Footnote_1845" class="fnanchor">[1845]</a> The saliva of a fasting human being cures abscesses
and removes scars and blotches.<a id="FNanchor_1846" href="#Footnote_1846" class="fnanchor">[1846]</a> It kills serpent or
scorpion, if it falls into its mouth or wound so as to reach
its inner parts. If the tip of an arrow or sword has touched
the lips of a fasting man, it inflicts a poisonous wound, say
those who have tested it. Others say that if the wax and
dirt from dogs’ ears are smeared on wicks of new cotton,
and these are placed in a crucible in green oil and lighted,
the heads of persons present will appear entirely bald.<a id="FNanchor_1847" href="#Footnote_1847" class="fnanchor">[1847]</a> This
sort of half-magical, half-chemical experiment with various
combustible or illuminating compositions, which are supposed
to produce optical or other illusions, is not infrequently
met with in medieval manuscripts, especially alchemical ones,
and we shall in a later chapter encounter further specimens
thereof in works ascribed to Albert himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_562">[Pg 562]</span></p><div class="sidenote">Dragons.</div>

<p>Albert is rather unusually sceptical concerning dragons,
which are generally the theme of so many marvelous stories.
That a dragon is large enough to crush an elephant with a
twist of its tail, that the Ethiopians eat the flesh of dragons
to cool themselves, that dragons are afraid of thunder and
therefore enchanters imitate it with drums in order to capture
dragons and ride on them through space,<a id="FNanchor_1848" href="#Footnote_1848" class="fnanchor">[1848]</a>&mdash;all such
assertions Albert treats as rumors rather than tested facts.
He also suggests that meteors or flaming vapors have been
mistaken for dragons flying through the air and breathing
forth fire. We have already, however, heard his tale of a
serpent with a human face.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
basilisk.</div>

<p>Albert still believes, moreover, that the mere glance and
hiss of the basilisk are fatal. But while the reptile’s glance
will kill as far as its vision extends, its hiss is not fatal as
far as it can be heard but only as far as it is propagated by
the basilisk’s breath.<a id="FNanchor_1849" href="#Footnote_1849" class="fnanchor">[1849]</a> Albert rejects as neither true nor
reasonable Pliny’s assertion that if a man sees a basilisk
first, his glance is fatal to it. “Nor do Avicenna and
Semerion, philosophers who tell what they have experienced,
mention this.” But Albert repeats Pliny’s story of the
horseman who was killed by touching with the end of his
long lance a corpse slain by a basilisk. He rejects, however,
as false and impossible the notion that the basilisk is generated
from a cock’s egg, and the books of wise philosophers
do not support the assertion that there is a flying variety of
basilisk. But scattering the ashes of a basilisk expels spiders
and other venomous creatures, and hence in antiquity its
ashes were scattered in temples. Hermes says that silver
rubbed with its ash takes on the splendor and weight and
solidity of gold; Hermes also teaches that the basilisk is
generated in glass, but Albert interprets this as an allusion
to some alchemical elixir by which metals are transmuted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Remedies
for falcons
and
mad dogs.</div>

<p>Very amusing are the detailed recipes for every ailment
of the birds in the chapters on the infirmities of falcons.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_563">[Pg 563]</span><a id="FNanchor_1850" href="#Footnote_1850" class="fnanchor">[1850]</a>
These appear to be culled chiefly from the works on falconry
of the Emperor Frederick and of King William, one of the
Norman line which preceded him in the kingdom of Sicily.
To make the birds fierce one is advised to feed them flesh
soaked in urine. If a falcon develops a cataract, one should
inject into its eye a mixture of pulverized fennel seed and
the milk of a woman bearing a male child. Several prayers
and incantations are recommended for use when taking up
the falcon in the morning, when releasing it in fowling, and
in order to preserve it from injury from eagles. In the last
case the words to be repeated are, “Leo conquers of the
tribe of Judah, root of David, Alleluia.” Albert adds, however,
“But these last items,” meaning probably the incantations,
“are not so reasonable as the first,” meaning probably
the more purely medicinal directions. Equally diverting is
a cure of a mad dog borrowed by Albert from a king of
Valencia. For nine days the hound should be so immersed
in hot water that his hind legs barely touch the ground
while his fore legs are held erect. After that his head should
be shaved and his hair well plucked out so that the skin is
wounded. Then he should be anointed with beet juice and
ducked often and soaked in the same juice. “And if he eats
anything, give him some pith of the elder tree, for it will
do him good. And if this treatment fails to benefit him
within the space of seven days, kill him, for he is incurable.”<a id="FNanchor_1851" href="#Footnote_1851" class="fnanchor">[1851]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Habits and
remedies
of animals.</div>

<p>Albert’s treatise on animals not only ascribes marvelous
properties and medicinal virtues to various portions of their
carcasses, but also continues to some extent the tradition of
crediting them with semi-human intelligence and medical
knowledge. Albert discredits, however, the report of the
adultery of the lioness with the leopard and her craftiness
in concealing it, and he also rejects as contrary to the wise
provision of nature the statement that the lion suffers continually
from quartan fever.<a id="FNanchor_1852" href="#Footnote_1852" class="fnanchor">[1852]</a> But he believes that a sick
lion cures itself by eating an ape or drinking the blood of a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_564">[Pg 564]</span>
dog. Even the tortoise (<i>tortuca</i>?), although it seems to
Albert a sort of reptile and lacking in “noble virtues of the
soul,” yet from mere natural sagacity eats wild origanum
after it has eaten the viper in order to overcome the chill of
the venom by the heat of the herb.<a id="FNanchor_1853" href="#Footnote_1853" class="fnanchor">[1853]</a> And someone in Aristotle’s
time learned by experience that it will not eat a viper
except in a place where this herb is available, and that if
the herb is removed while it is eating the viper it will die
from want of it. Avicenna tells a similar experience of an
old man who was an experienced hunter and deserving
credence. He saw a bird of slow movement and weak flight
fighting with a viper. As often as it was wounded, it would
retreat, eat some of a certain herb, and then return renewed
to the fight. The observer covertly removed the herb and
when the bird returned again and failed to find it, it raised a
great outcry and died. From the old hunter’s description
of the plant’s shape and color Avicenna judged it to be wild
lettuce (<i>lectuca agrestis</i>).</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
virtues
of herbs.</div>

<p>Thus the remedies employed by animals bring us to the
virtues of herbs. The “divine effects” of certain plants, as
we have seen, Albert regards as lying within the province
of magic rather than that of his treatise on plants, but he
mentions a few, such as that planting a certain herb on the
roof protects the house from lightning,<a id="FNanchor_1854" href="#Footnote_1854" class="fnanchor">[1854]</a> and that carrying
another stirs up quarrels and hatreds,<a id="FNanchor_1855" href="#Footnote_1855" class="fnanchor">[1855]</a> while a woman who
wears a third about her neck will not become pregnant.<a id="FNanchor_1856" href="#Footnote_1856" class="fnanchor">[1856]</a>
But he believes that there is strong virtue in herbs in general.
Their elemental qualities are unusually acute and
closely akin to the excellencies of the pure elements. They
grow close to the ground and “recede less from the first
fertilizing humor in the earth.”<a id="FNanchor_1857" href="#Footnote_1857" class="fnanchor">[1857]</a> In them matter predominates
more and the form of the vegetable soul is less
developed than in other kinds of vegetation. Consequently
they are more efficacious in altering other bodies and are
used by physicians more than any other class of remedies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_565">[Pg 565]</span></p><div class="sidenote">Their
medicinal
use.</div>

<p>Most, indeed, of the virtues of herbs mentioned by Albert
are medicinal. Sometimes the method of applying them is
injudicious, as when a root of parsley is hung from the neck
to cure toothache, or artemisia is bound to the legs to prevent
wayfarers from feeling weariness.<a id="FNanchor_1858" href="#Footnote_1858" class="fnanchor">[1858]</a> More often, however,
our criticism is that the same disease is represented
as curable by too many different plants, or that a single herb
is made a cure for a long list of very miscellaneous and
unrelated ills, not content with which Albert often concludes,
“And it has many other effects.” Selecting an example at
random, we may note what he says of the nasturtium.<a id="FNanchor_1859" href="#Footnote_1859" class="fnanchor">[1859]</a>
“It possesses acidity, is hot and dry, acts as a gentle purgative
and laxative, and dries up the putridity of an empty
belly. Used as a potion and liniment, it keeps the hair from
falling out. Combined with salt and water, it helps abscesses
and carbuncles, and mixed with honey, it eradicates Persian
Fire and is good for all softening of the muscles. It purifies
the lungs and relieves asthma by its sharp, cutting qualities.
It warms the stomach and liver and cures enlarged spleen,
but its disturbing quality is bad for the stomach. <i>Auget
coitum et multiplicat menstrua et eiicit foetum, sed tamen
si non teratur et confringatur, retinet ipsum.</i> It is good for
venomous bites, and if carefully prepared, works many other
effects.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Occult
virtue of
herbs due
to the
stars.</div>

<p>According to Albert the properties of plants are produced
by the combination of five virtues: that of the element
which preponderates in the composition of the plant, the cooperating
virtue of the other elements which are mixed with
it, the virtue of the proportion in which they are mixed, the
influence of the stars, and the virtue of the vegetable soul.
“The virtue of the place (where the plant grows) and the
virtue of the surrounding air are also effective, but they
do not enter into the plant’s nature so essentially as the
aforesaid five virtues.”<a id="FNanchor_1860" href="#Footnote_1860" class="fnanchor">[1860]</a> “Its specific form,” upon which
its occult virtues largely depend, is given to the plant by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_566">[Pg 566]</span>
the motion of the heavens, especially by the movement of
the planets through the circle of the zodiac,<a id="FNanchor_1861" href="#Footnote_1861" class="fnanchor">[1861]</a> and their position
in relation to the fixed stars. Plants receive this influence
at the time of their formation, when vapors, potentially
seminal and formative, ascend from the depths of
earth and meet the dewy air as it descends.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Occult
virtue of
stones.</div>

<p>It is unnecessary to repeat the marvelous powers attributed
to particular gems and stones by Albert in his treatise
on minerals, since they are either copied from or similar
to those of Marbod, Costa ben Luca, and Constantinus
Africanus. What, however, he has to say on the general
subject of their occult virtue is worth noting. He states
that many doubt if stones really have such powers as to cure
ulcers, counteract poisons, conciliate human hearts, and win
victories. Such sceptics contend that a compound substance
like a gem can exert only such powers as one can account
for from the elements which enter into its composition and
the composition itself. Albert grants that the wonders
worked by means of stones seem “more prodigious and
marvelous” than those produced by simple substances, that
the physical constitution of stones does not seem to justify
the existence of such powers in them, and that “the cause of
the virtue of stones is indeed occult.” But he maintains
that such occult virtues are well established by experience,
“since we see the magnet attract iron and the adamant restrict
that virtue in the magnet.”<a id="FNanchor_1862" href="#Footnote_1862" class="fnanchor">[1862]</a> Albert has seen with
his own eyes a sapphire which removed ulcers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Due to
the stars.</div>

<p>Albert finds that students of nature (<i>physiologi</i>)&mdash;it
will be noted that the word cannot possibly refer here to
the authors of such works as the <i>Physiologus</i>&mdash;have assigned
very diverse causes for this marvelous virtue of
stones. He rejects as “most absurd” the suggestion of certain
Pythagoreans that it is due to the action of souls or
of a world-soul in stones. Alexander Aphrodisiensis argues
from the operations of alchemy that some chemical change
makes the compound stone far more potent than any or all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_567">[Pg 567]</span>
of its constituents. Plato thinks that all inferior objects
are imbued with superior ideas; Hermes and Avicenna suggest
that celestial virtue is responsible. Albert himself concludes
that the occult virtue of stones resides in their specific
forms, in which, as in the case of herbs, the influence of
the stars plays the chief part. Albert’s discussion of the
virtue of gems is repeated in a <i>Summa philosophiae</i> ascribed
to Robert Grosseteste, but in part at least written after his
death. The author regards “Albert of Cologne” as having
“spoken more certainly than others in this matter.”<a id="FNanchor_1863" href="#Footnote_1863" class="fnanchor">[1863]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Pseudo-Albert
<i>De lapidibus</i>.</div>

<p>Albert’s discussion of the engraving of images and seals
on stones in his treatise on minerals has already been mentioned
in connection with his attitude toward magic and
will come up again in connection with his attitude towards
astrology. Besides the treatise on minerals there seems to
be another work on stones ascribed to Albert which is spurious.
It deals with the colors and virtues of stones, and,
like Thetel and the fourteenth book of Thomas of Cantimpré,
with their sculpture and consecration.<a id="FNanchor_1864" href="#Footnote_1864" class="fnanchor">[1864]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Alchemy.</div>

<p>In his third book concerning minerals Albert judiciously
discusses alchemy, citing Avicenna and Hermes especially.
He says that of all the arts alchemy most closely imitates
nature.<a id="FNanchor_1865" href="#Footnote_1865" class="fnanchor">[1865]</a> Albert regards the various metals as distinct
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_568">[Pg 568]</span>
species, and hardly accepts the assertions of Hermes, Gilgil,
Empedocles, and other alchemists that in each metal there
are several species and natures, one manifest and another
occult,<a id="FNanchor_1866" href="#Footnote_1866" class="fnanchor">[1866]</a> one external and another internal, one superficial
and another deep. Albert then considers the remark of
Avicenna, incorrectly ascribed by some to Aristotle, that
the alchemists cannot alter species but can make them appear
alike, as when they color copper so that it seems to be gold.<a id="FNanchor_1867" href="#Footnote_1867" class="fnanchor">[1867]</a>
Avicenna has also remarked in his <i>Alchemy</i>, however, that
species can perhaps be reduced to first matter and then by
the aid of the art formed into the species of the desired
metal. Albert thinks that perhaps, as physicians by their
medicines purge away corrupt matter and afterwards restore
health, so skilled alchemists may purify a great mass of
quicksilver and sulphur, which according to Avicenna are
the material constituents of all metals, and then combine
these in due ratio of elemental and celestial virtues for the
composition of the metal which they wish to obtain.<a id="FNanchor_1868" href="#Footnote_1868" class="fnanchor">[1868]</a> But
those who merely color the metal white or yellow, while the
species of the baser metal remains in the material, are beyond
doubt deceivers and do not make true gold or true silver.
Unfortunately all alchemists proceed in this fashion to a
greater or less extent, and Albert has subjected gold made
by them to fire and has found that it is finally consumed,
after it has stood the test of fire perhaps six or seven times.</p>

<p>Albert thus suggests that the transmutation of metals
by means of human art is possible, although he does not
regard the alchemists as having yet employed the right
method. But it is hard to see how Peter of Prussia got
the notion that Albert had condemned the art of alchemy in
the <i>De mineralibus</i> and could not be the author of a treatise
on the subject.<a id="FNanchor_1869" href="#Footnote_1869" class="fnanchor">[1869]</a> In other passages Albert speaks of alchemy
without disapproval and apparently with respect. He cites
“alchemical experiments” concerning the evaporation of
water when heated.<a id="FNanchor_1870" href="#Footnote_1870" class="fnanchor">[1870]</a> He repeats the argument of Alexander
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_569">[Pg 569]</span>
of Aphrodisias that the occult virtues of gems are due to the
mixture of the elements in them, as is proved by the operations
of alchemy, in which simple substances effect little, but
when mixed together produce truly marvelous effects.<a id="FNanchor_1871" href="#Footnote_1871" class="fnanchor">[1871]</a> And
as one instance of the influence exerted by the moon he
states that skilled alchemists work during the waxing of
the moon because then they produce purer metals and purer
stones, especially when they are really expert and do not
hurry their operations but await the opportune time when
the process will be aided by celestial virtue.<a id="FNanchor_1872" href="#Footnote_1872" class="fnanchor">[1872]</a> On the whole,
however, as these passages show, Albert’s mentions of
alchemy are mainly allusive. He does not treat of it fully
in his Aristotelian treatises apparently because, as we saw
earlier, he regarded it as a separate subject from physics or
physical science, bordering more on the field of natural
magic. The question therefore next arises whether he ever
wrote a work or works dealing especially with alchemy, just
as the question will arise whether he ever wrote any works
in the field of natural magic.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Works of

<p>Berthelot gives the impression in his <i>La Chimie au
Moyen Age</i><a id="FNanchor_1873" href="#Footnote_1873" class="fnanchor">[1873]</a> that there was but one alchemistic treatise
current under the name of Albertus Magnus. This he describes
as a serious and methodical work but written a little
after Albert’s time. But the manuscripts seem to contain
several, or rather, nearly a dozen, different works of alchemy
ascribed to Albert.<a id="FNanchor_1874" href="#Footnote_1874" class="fnanchor">[1874]</a> In the University library at Bologna
alone there appear to be six different alchemistic treatises
ascribed to Albert, and three of them in one manuscript.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_570">[Pg 570]</span><a id="FNanchor_1875" href="#Footnote_1875" class="fnanchor">[1875]</a>
In one manuscript of the British Museum is a rather lengthy
“<i>Practica</i> of Brother Albert in alchemy which is called by
the same the Secret of Secrets,” in seven books. The text,
however, cites Albert’s work on minerals, stating that the
Latins in general have discovered very little for themselves
experimentally in alchemy but have been dependent upon
translations from other languages, but that “Albert, once
of Ratisbon, the crown of the Latins,” studied it and discovered
some secrets by experimentation, as he bears witness
in his “<i>De mineralibus</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_1876" href="#Footnote_1876" class="fnanchor">[1876]</a> Presently Albert is again
cited in a list of old masters who labored at this art, Alexander
the Great, Dioscorides, and others.<a id="FNanchor_1877" href="#Footnote_1877" class="fnanchor">[1877]</a> In another manuscript
at the British Museum is a much briefer <i>Of the hidden
things of nature</i> ascribed to Albertus Magnus.<a id="FNanchor_1878" href="#Footnote_1878" class="fnanchor">[1878]</a> What
seems to be still another brief tract on alchemy ascribed to
Albert occurs in a manuscript at Cambridge. It concludes
with the statement, “And I Albert say that I have tested these
two operations and that there is no other perfect work by
me except these two works, and they are true. Euclid, too,
and many philosophers agree with me and assert that all
the value of this art consists in Mercury and the Moon and
in Mercury and the Sun, and you should know that all others
are vain and illusory. Thanks to God.”<a id="FNanchor_1879" href="#Footnote_1879" class="fnanchor">[1879]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_571">[Pg 571]</span></p><div class="sidenote">A more
detailed
description
of one
of them:
preface.</div>

<p>Of these various treatises in alchemy ascribed to Albert
we shall now consider in more detail the one which has
been included in editions of his works,<a id="FNanchor_1880" href="#Footnote_1880" class="fnanchor">[1880]</a> and which is perhaps
the most likely of any of them to be genuine. It is ascribed
to Albert in a manuscript list of the writings of Dominicans
drawn up before 1350, and also by Pignon.<a id="FNanchor_1881" href="#Footnote_1881" class="fnanchor">[1881]</a> It is also an
unusually intelligible treatise for a work of alchemy and so
the better lends itself to description and summary. After
opening in devout tone with praise of God and invocation
of His aid, the author proceeds to tell in somewhat Albertine
style how he has traversed many regions, provinces, cities,
and castles with great labor for the sake of the science which
is called alchemy, and has diligently inspected the books on
the subject by men of erudition and learning, but has found
nothing true in them. He has also encountered “many very
rich men, scholars, abbots, <i>praepositi</i>, canons, physicians,
and illiterate persons,” who have expended much money and
toil without result. He did not despair, however, but went
to infinite expense and labor, keeping his eyes open and constantly
moving from place to place, until at last he found
what he sought “not by any science of mine but by the grace
of the Holy Spirit.” He therefore, the least of philosophers,
intends to write to his friends and associates concerning
this art, true, easy, and infallible, yet so that seeing
they shall not see and hearing they shall not understand.
And he adjures them to keep it secret and not to show his
book to the foolish.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Experimental
method
and equipment.</div>

<p>After this preface, the first of the fifty-seven chapters,
for the most part brief, into which the treatise is divided,
lists various “errors” which have made the previous efforts
of alchemists a failure. The author also strikes an experimental
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_572">[Pg 572]</span>
key-note for his work, stating that after seeing so
many fail he has decided to write true and approved works
and the best which all the philosophers have to offer, works
furthermore in which he has labored and which he has
tested by experience, and he will write nothing but what
he has seen with his own eyes.<a id="FNanchor_1882" href="#Footnote_1882" class="fnanchor">[1882]</a> After suggesting a derivation
for the word “alchemy”<a id="FNanchor_1883" href="#Footnote_1883" class="fnanchor">[1883]</a> and a theory for the origin
of metals and “proof that alchemy is a true art,”<a id="FNanchor_1884" href="#Footnote_1884" class="fnanchor">[1884]</a> the author
lays down eight precepts for alchemists to follow. The
alchemist should work silently and secretly or he may be
arrested as a counterfeiter. He should have a laboratory,
“a special house away from the sight of men in which there
are two or three rooms in which experiments may be conducted.”<a id="FNanchor_1885" href="#Footnote_1885" class="fnanchor">[1885]</a>
He must observe time and seasons; the process
of sublimation, for instance, cannot be successfully performed
in winter. He must be a sedulous, persevering, untiring,
and constant worker. In his operations he must
observe due order: first <i>contributio</i>; then <i>sublimatio</i>; third,
<i>fixio</i>; fourth, <i>calcinatio</i>; fifth, <i>solutio</i>; sixth, <i>coagulatio</i>;
processes which are further explained in chapters 30 to 35.
All the vessels which he uses should be made of glass. He
should fight shy of princes and potentates, and finally, should
have plenty of money. Chapters four to eight then deal
with the subject of furnaces, and chapter nine tells how to
glaze clay vessels.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Differences
between
transmuted
and
natural
metals.</div>

<p>In the tenth chapter, besides discussing what are the
four “spirits” of metals which dye or color, the author
states his opinion as to the extent to which metals can be
transmuted. He believes that metals can be produced by
alchemy which are the equal of natural metals in almost
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_573">[Pg 573]</span>
all their qualities and effects, except that the iron of alchemy
is not attracted by the stone adamant, and that the gold of
alchemy does not stimulate the human heart or cure
leprosy, while a wound inflicted by it swells up as one made
by natural gold would not do. “But in every other operation,
hammering, testing, and color, it will endure forever.”
In the two following chapters the author discusses what
the Elixir is and the kinds of medicines.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Substances
and processes
of
alchemy.</div>

<p>A number of chapters are next devoted to description
of various minerals, chemicals, dyes, and coloring matter,
such as mercury, sulphur, orpiment, arsenic, salts of ammonia,
common salt, various other salts, azure, minium,
ceruse, and so on. We are then instructed in various processes
such as whitening quicksilver or sulphur or orpiment
or arsenic, the making of powders, solutions, and distillations,
leading up finally in the last two chapters to two brief
recipes for the making of the precious metals. The general
plan of this treatise is one to which many others conform;
it is noteworthy further for the absence of mysticism and
magic procedure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ligatures
and suspensions.</div>

<p>We have already noted in Albert’s works some instances
of marvels worked by herbs bound to the body or suspended
from the neck. In his treatise on plants he cited books
concerning physical ligatures<a id="FNanchor_1886" href="#Footnote_1886" class="fnanchor">[1886]</a> for the divine effects of
plants with which magic is especially concerned. But in
his treatise on minerals, after stating that the marvels
worked by images engraved on gems cannot be explained
by the laws of physical science but require a knowledge of
“astronomy” and magic and necromancy,<a id="FNanchor_1887" href="#Footnote_1887" class="fnanchor">[1887]</a> he adds that
ligatures and suspensions of stones seem to operate naturally
and belong more to physical science.<a id="FNanchor_1888" href="#Footnote_1888" class="fnanchor">[1888]</a> He cites, however,
Socrates, probably through the medium of Costa ben
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_574">[Pg 574]</span>
Luca, to the effect that ligatures and suspensions are one
of four kinds of incantations, and that they affect the mind,
depressing or elating it and so affecting the health of the
body. This half-sceptical attitude seems to influence Albert
little, for he states that for the present he intends to treat
only of ligatures and suspensions of stones, of which he
proceeds to list examples for a page and a half drawn
largely from Costa ben Luca’s treatise. In his work on
animals Albert again quotes Costa ben Luca to the effect
that dogs will not bite the wearer of a dog’s heart.<a id="FNanchor_1889" href="#Footnote_1889" class="fnanchor">[1889]</a> Others
say that they will not bark at one who holds in his hand the
tooth of a black dog, “and so robbers carry such a tooth
with them at night.” Albert further finds in the book of
sixty animals&mdash;probably the work ascribed to Rasis&mdash;that
dog’s teeth should be suspended from the neck of a patient
suffering from jaundice.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Incantations.</div>

<p>Albert does not expressly discuss the power of words
or incantations. It is rarely that he repeats any incantations,
and it will be remembered that those which he quoted from
books on falcons were accompanied with a word of caution.
His belief in the power of characters or images engraved
on gems may be best discussed in connection with his attitude
towards astrology.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fascination.</div>

<p>The power of fascination possessed by one human being
over another is touched upon by Albert in three different
treatises.<a id="FNanchor_1890" href="#Footnote_1890" class="fnanchor">[1890]</a> We have already heard him identify it with
magic. He cites certain Pythagoreans as affirming that the
soul of a man or other animal can act upon another, fascinating
it and impeding its working. He quotes Hermes as
telling Esclepius that man is so endowed with divine intellect
and raised above the world, that its matter follows his
thought, and so the sage can work transformations and
miracles in nature or fascinate another person through sight
or some other sense. Avicenna and Algazel “say that souls
can in so far conform to the celestial intelligence that it will
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_575">[Pg 575]</span>
alter material bodies at their pleasure, and then such a man
will work wonders.” It is not clear, however, to what extent
Albert agrees with the authorities he has cited; he
remarks that the power of the soul in fascination can scarcely
be proved by philosophy, but he perhaps simply means that
it can be proved by magic.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Physiognomy.</div>

<p>In a passage of his treatise on animals<a id="FNanchor_1891" href="#Footnote_1891" class="fnanchor">[1891]</a> Albert describes
physiognomy as a science which divines a man’s character
from the physical form of the various parts of his body.
He explains, however, that the configuration of one’s physical
features does not absolutely force one to a corresponding
course of action. Thus he upholds human free will against
a mechanistic view of man, or rather he shows that the
physiognomists themselves do. He cites Aristotle, to whom
we have seen that a treatise on physiognomy was ascribed,
for the following story: The disciples of Hippocrates made
a perfect image of him and submitted it to an excellent
physiognomist, who declared it the likeness of a man given
to luxury, deceit, and lusts of the body. The disciples were
angered at this slur upon the character of their master, who
they knew lived a sober and upright life; but Hippocrates
himself told them that the physiognomist had judged aright
as to his natural traits, and that it was only by love of
philosophy and integrity and a life of study and effort that
he had triumphed over nature. A treatise on chiromancy
is ascribed to Albert in more than one manuscript.<a id="FNanchor_1892" href="#Footnote_1892" class="fnanchor">[1892]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Aristotle
on divination
from
dreams.</div>

<p>In the third book of his <i>De somno et vigilia</i><a id="FNanchor_1893" href="#Footnote_1893" class="fnanchor">[1893]</a> Albert
complains that Aristotle’s treatment of divination from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_576">[Pg 576]</span>
dreams is unsatisfactory; being “brief, deficient in proof,
naïve, unphilosophical, imperfect,” and having “many doubtful
points because it leaves the causes of such dreams uncertain.”
Aristotle’s attitude was in fact a vacillating one,
since he found it “not easy either to despise or to believe” in
that kind of divination. Yet Roger Bacon tells us that one
reason why the study of the books of Aristotle on natural
philosophy was forbidden at Paris before 1237 was this
third book of his <i>De somno et vigilia</i> dealing with divination
from dreams.<a id="FNanchor_1894" href="#Footnote_1894" class="fnanchor">[1894]</a> But perhaps this was because of commentaries
of Averroes which accompanied it or errors in
translation of which Bacon speaks.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Albert on
divination
from
dreams.</div>

<p>Little as Aristotle said, he came nearer the truth in
Albert’s opinion than any other extant philosophers, among
whom there is great diversity of view. However, that
dreams are prophetic “is no idle report but the testimony of
experience,”<a id="FNanchor_1895" href="#Footnote_1895" class="fnanchor">[1895]</a> and Albert thinks that there is scarcely anyone
who has not been warned in his dreams of many future
events. “Socrates put great faith in divination from
dreams.”<a id="FNanchor_1896" href="#Footnote_1896" class="fnanchor">[1896]</a> Interpretation of dreams is necessary, for
dreams cannot be exact images of future events, since these
are as yet non-existent.<a id="FNanchor_1897" href="#Footnote_1897" class="fnanchor">[1897]</a> Predictions from dreams, even if
correctly made, do not invariably come true, just as medical
prognostications and the predictions of augurs&mdash;of whom
we are surprised to hear Albert speak approvingly&mdash;sometimes
fail owing to the arising of some conflicting cause.<a id="FNanchor_1898" href="#Footnote_1898" class="fnanchor">[1898]</a>
The dreamer must be free from care and passion. Albert
agrees with Aristotle that dreams requiring interpretation
do not come from God but have a natural cause; while the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_577">[Pg 577]</span>
future cannot be foretold from dreams which have an accidental
cause.<a id="FNanchor_1899" href="#Footnote_1899" class="fnanchor">[1899]</a> More specifically he finds the cause of dreams
not, like Socrates and Plato, in demons and corporeal and
incorporeal gods,<a id="FNanchor_1900" href="#Footnote_1900" class="fnanchor">[1900]</a> nor, like Democritus, in atoms streaming
from the stars through the pores of the dreamer into his
inmost soul, but in the motion of the stars acting upon the
body of man, who is in a sense a microcosm or image of
the universe (<i>imago mundi</i>).<a id="FNanchor_1901" href="#Footnote_1901" class="fnanchor">[1901]</a> The interpreter of dreams
must be quick to see associations and similarities from the
realm of nature and of art, he must understand astronomy
and astrology, and the state of health and mind of the
dreamer.<a id="FNanchor_1902" href="#Footnote_1902" class="fnanchor">[1902]</a> Albert again discusses divination from dreams
in much the same way in the second part of his <i>Summa de
creaturis</i> and in his <i>De apprehensione</i>.<a id="FNanchor_1903" href="#Footnote_1903" class="fnanchor">[1903]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Augury.</div>

<p>In the <i>De somno et vigilia</i> he mentions one further
variety of vision “when the celestial influence is so strong
that it affects even while awake one whose attention is not
occupied by the distractions of sense.” Such visions move
the bodies of animals even when they are awake, “and then
their movements have some future signification, which
augurs endeavor to note and interpret. On so much ground
of reason is divination by augury based.”<a id="FNanchor_1904" href="#Footnote_1904" class="fnanchor">[1904]</a></p>

<h4 id="ATTITUDE_TOWARD">V. <i>Attitude Toward Astrology</i></h4>

<div class="sidenote">His
emphasis
upon the
influence
of the
stars.</div>

<p>We come finally to that influence of the heavens and
stars which makes the art of augury and divination from
dreams possible, which serves to explain the occult virtue of
herbs and stones, and to that “astronomy,” or astrology as
we should say, which is so closely associated with the science
of the magi and with necromancy. Albert’s astrological
view’s crop out in almost all his scientific treatises rather
than merely in those dealing with astronomical subjects, such
as the <i>Meteorology</i>, the <i>De coelo et mundo</i>, and the <i>De
causis et procreatione universi</i>. Especially astrological in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_578">[Pg 578]</span>
character is the treatise <i>On the Causes and Properties of the
Elements and Planets</i>.<a id="FNanchor_1905" href="#Footnote_1905" class="fnanchor">[1905]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Problem
of the authorship
of the
<i>Speculum
astronomiae</i>.</div>

<p>Another treatise very important in the history of astrology
is the <i>Speculum astronomiae</i>, hitherto usually placed
among Albert’s works<a id="FNanchor_1906" href="#Footnote_1906" class="fnanchor">[1906]</a> but recently declared by Father
Mandonnet<a id="FNanchor_1907" href="#Footnote_1907" class="fnanchor">[1907]</a> to be the work of Roger Bacon. Although
Mandonnet adduced no evidence of manuscripts in favor of
the Baconian authorship, other students of Roger Bacon<a id="FNanchor_1908" href="#Footnote_1908" class="fnanchor">[1908]</a>
have since unquestioningly accepted this attribution of the
<i>Speculum</i> to him, but I shall show that there is no good
reason for it. This may best be done, however, by delaying
our consideration of the <i>Speculum astronomiae</i> itself until
after we have taken up Roger Bacon and his views. But in
our present discussion of Albert’s other writings we may
break the backbone of Mandonnet’s argument, which is his
extraordinary contention that Albert did not believe in astrology
and that Roger Bacon was “the only ecclesiastical
author in the second half of the thirteenth century who has
undertaken the defense of judicial astrology and of the other
occult sciences which depend more or less directly upon it.”<a id="FNanchor_1909" href="#Footnote_1909" class="fnanchor">[1909]</a>
Mandonnet criticized Charles for saying of Roger Bacon’s
astrological views, “These doctrines, which seem contemptible
to us, were widespread in the thirteenth century;
Albert was not free from them; St. Thomas merely expressed
some reservations but did not deny the science.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_579">[Pg 579]</span>
Mandonnet declares that Charles “has given no evidence for
his conclusion and could not do so,”<a id="FNanchor_1910" href="#Footnote_1910" class="fnanchor">[1910]</a> but our detailed presentation
of the opinions of the men named and of others
will show that Charles was quite right and that Mandonnet
is all wrong.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mandonnet
fails
to prove
Albert
hostile to
astrology.</div>

<p>Mandonnet, in fact, gives no sign of having ever
candidly examined the works of Albert to see what his attitude
towards astrology really was, so that it seems arrant
presumption on his part to question Charles’ statement.
And he himself gives no justification for having questioned
it. He cites only one passage directly from Albert’s works,
and it is merely a repetition of the argument of the saints
that the star at Christ’s birth was a miraculous apparition
in the upper air rather than the sky.<a id="FNanchor_1911" href="#Footnote_1911" class="fnanchor">[1911]</a> Then he quotes three
passages from the fifteenth century biography of Peter of
Prussia as if they were Albert’s own statements. If they
are, why does not Mandonnet state where they are to be
found in Albert’s works? Also why does he not state that
these passages occur in chapters where Peter is making an
effort, none too successful or disingenuous, to defend Albert
from the charge of having devoted too much attention to
nigromancy and such arts rather than to mere astrology?
Mandonnet does note that Peter believed Albert to be the
author of the <i>Speculum astronomiae</i>, but he does not
note that Peter in these very chapters which he cites
relies chiefly on the <i>Speculum astronomiae</i> to clear Albert
from the charge of dabbling in nigromancy. In brief, Peter
proves from the <i>Speculum</i> that Albert did not favor nigromancy;
then Mandonnet proves from Peter that Albert did
not believe in astrology and so could not have written the
<i>Speculum</i>! In succeeding chapters<a id="FNanchor_1912" href="#Footnote_1912" class="fnanchor">[1912]</a> Peter goes on to try
to make out from the <i>Speculum</i> that Albert opposed astrological
images and interrogations and that he was more outspoken
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_580">[Pg 580]</span>
against them than Aquinas. But this Mandonnet
says nothing of, and it would not fit his argument.</p>

<p>The passages from Peter which Mandonnet does select
as suited to his purpose are as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The pursuits of magicians and necromancers are evil
and superfluous and forbidden by the church.... That
<i>mathematici</i> or idolaters sometimes predict the future is
the outcome of conjecture and fatuous presumption, not
of certitude.... There are three things to which some
men have recourse, namely, sorcerers, enchanters, and
<i>mathematici</i>, but which really are not wisdom but foolishness,
for the Chaldeans rely on such methods. The <i>mathematici</i>
seek to reduce the effects of the stars to fixed hours,
and those who investigate such things are far from the
one science of God.”<a id="FNanchor_1913" href="#Footnote_1913" class="fnanchor">[1913]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Even if these passages are from Albert’s works, they are no
proof that he condemned astrology. Roger Bacon penned
very similar passages, and the <i>Speculum astronomiae</i> expresses
no approval of either enchanters or sorcerers or
magicians or <i>mathematici</i>. We have already repeatedly seen
that <i>mathematici</i> was used in two senses and that one might
condemn the <i>mathematici</i> as diviners and yet accept astrology.
Albert himself made such a distinction in his <i>Commentary
on Matthew</i><a id="FNanchor_1914" href="#Footnote_1914" class="fnanchor">[1914]</a> where he differentiates between two, or
rather three, kinds of mathematics. One is the abstract science
in our present sense of the word; the other, more properly
called <i>mathesis</i> and pronounced with a long middle syllable,
is “divination by the stars,” but it in turn may be either
good or bad, superstitious or scientific. Thus it is proved
by a direct examination of Albert’s writings that, contrary
to the impression which Mandonnet strives to give by his
citation from Peter of Prussia, even in his theological works
Albert did not condemn all <i>mathematici</i> even, to say nothing
of astrology. And we have further seen that in his scientific
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_581">[Pg 581]</span>
writings he sometimes does not condemn even magic.
We shall now proceed to show from numerous passages in
other works than the <i>Speculum astronomiae</i> how favorably
inclined toward astrology Albert really was.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nature
of the
heavens
and the
stars.</div>

<p>Albert accepts the Aristotelian description of the sky
and heavenly bodies as formed of a fifth element distinct
from the four elements of which earthly objects are composed.<a id="FNanchor_1915" href="#Footnote_1915" class="fnanchor">[1915]</a>
In another passage he subdivides the heavenly substance
into three elements composing respectively the sun,
the moon and stars, and the sky apart from the celestial
bodies.<a id="FNanchor_1916" href="#Footnote_1916" class="fnanchor">[1916]</a> In any case the stars are nobler than inferior
bodies, “less involved in the shadows and privations of
matter,” and closer to the first cause of the universe.<a id="FNanchor_1917" href="#Footnote_1917" class="fnanchor">[1917]</a> Their
motion is eternal, unchangeable, incorruptible.<a id="FNanchor_1918" href="#Footnote_1918" class="fnanchor">[1918]</a> Some have
called them animals but Albert holds that they are not animals
in the sense that we apply that word to inferior creatures.<a id="FNanchor_1919" href="#Footnote_1919" class="fnanchor">[1919]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The First
Cause
and the
spheres.</div>

<p>Again like Aristotle, Albert regards the heavens and stars
as instruments of the first mover or intelligence, just as the
hand is the instrument of the human intellect in making
works of art.<a id="FNanchor_1920" href="#Footnote_1920" class="fnanchor">[1920]</a> They are mediums between the first cause and
matter. Albert believes in a number of heavens “existing
from the first heaven to the sphere of the moon.”<a id="FNanchor_1921" href="#Footnote_1921" class="fnanchor">[1921]</a> The
first mover moves the first heaven and through it the other
spheres included within it. Whether every other heaven has
its own celestial intelligence to move it is a question upon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_582">[Pg 582]</span>
which Albert is somewhat obscure.<a id="FNanchor_1922" href="#Footnote_1922" class="fnanchor">[1922]</a> Others certainly
thought so. He mentions, for instance, the opinion of certain
Arabs that floods are due to the imagination of the intelligence
which moves the sphere of the moon, and concedes
that there is some truth in it.<a id="FNanchor_1923" href="#Footnote_1923" class="fnanchor">[1923]</a> The ancient Stoics
and Epicureans, he tells us in another passage, ascribed
divinity to the virtue of the circle of the zodiac, which ruled
and governed life under the God of gods, as they called the
First Cause. Apuleius in the <i>De deo Socratis</i> says that they
called the twelve signs incorporeal gods, and the planets and
other stars corporeal gods, and the chief effects of the celestial
virtue upon inferior nature terrestrial gods.<a id="FNanchor_1924" href="#Footnote_1924" class="fnanchor">[1924]</a> But probably
Albert mentions this merely as an illustration of the
great influence exerted by the circle of the zodiac. In a third
passage he says that the movers of the celestial spheres,
whom the philosophers have called celestial intelligences, are
mediate causes between the First Cause and matter; but he
presently adds that philosophers of better understanding
have said that there is only one Mover of everything, and
that the so-called movers of the other spheres are but the
virtues and members of the first heaven and its Mover.<a id="FNanchor_1925" href="#Footnote_1925" class="fnanchor">[1925]</a>
Translated from terms of Aristotelian physics into those
of Christian theology, this means that the stars are merely
God’s instruments, and that, if there are spirits or intelligences
delegated to move the particular heavens, these angels
are also merely God’s agents.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Things
on earth
ruled by
the stars.</div>

<p>Since the celestial spheres and the stars are the instruments
and mediums through which the First Cause governs
the world of inferior creation, it follows that the four elements
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_583">[Pg 583]</span>
are generated by the motion of the heavens and that
plants, stones, minerals, animals&mdash;in short, whatever exists
in the inferior world is caused by the motion of the superior
bodies. This general law that the world of nature and of
life on this earth is governed by the movements of the stars
is expressly repeated again and again in Albert’s works,
and its truth is assumed even oftener.<a id="FNanchor_1926" href="#Footnote_1926" class="fnanchor">[1926]</a> We may note by
way of illustration a few of the specific applications of this
general law to be found in Albert’s writings. Arguing the
question whether life is possible in the torrid zone at the
equator, Albert points out that the rays of the stars are
more multiplied there and fall perpendicularly and directly
and therefore are even more favorable to the generation of
life than in our climate.<a id="FNanchor_1927" href="#Footnote_1927" class="fnanchor">[1927]</a> In another passage he explains
the pagan attribution of the thunderbolt to the god Jupiter
as probably a mistake due to the influence of the planet
Jupiter in provoking thunder-storms.<a id="FNanchor_1928" href="#Footnote_1928" class="fnanchor">[1928]</a> A third passage
ascribes the height of the inundation of the Nile to the
planets, stating that Venus and the Moon produce a greater
overflow than other drier stars.<a id="FNanchor_1929" href="#Footnote_1929" class="fnanchor">[1929]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Conjunctions.</div>

<p>Albert has a good deal to say of the effects produced
by the conjunctions of the planets,<a id="FNanchor_1930" href="#Footnote_1930" class="fnanchor">[1930]</a> ascribing to them great
mortality and depopulation, or “great accidents and great
prodigies and a general change of the state of the elements
and of the world.”<a id="FNanchor_1931" href="#Footnote_1931" class="fnanchor">[1931]</a> To a conjunction of Jupiter and Mars
with others aiding in the sign of Gemini he attributes pestilential
winds and corruption of the air resulting in a plague
by which a multitude of men and beasts suddenly perish.<a id="FNanchor_1932" href="#Footnote_1932" class="fnanchor">[1932]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Comets.</div>

<p>Albert also discusses comets, and why they signify wars
and the death of kings and potentates rather than of some
poor man.<a id="FNanchor_1933" href="#Footnote_1933" class="fnanchor">[1933]</a> Their especial connection with wars is explained
by the astrologer Albumasar as due to their association
with the planet Mars. As for kings, owing to their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_584">[Pg 584]</span>
greater fame and power, the relation of celestial phenomena
to their destinies has been observed more carefully than the
fate of the poor, and as their horoscopes have more planetary
dignity, so it is customary to refer greater portents to them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Man and
the stars.</div>

<p>Despite the allusion just made to royal horoscopes,
Albert makes an exception to the control of the stars over
this world in the case of man. Strictly speaking, however,
this is no exception, since man is not to be classed with
other inferiors inasmuch as his soul is a superior being,
derived from the First Intelligence and still subject to Its
illumination. “The essence of the soul is wholly and solely
from the first cause.”<a id="FNanchor_1934" href="#Footnote_1934" class="fnanchor">[1934]</a> It is true that Plato says that the
soul receives something in each sphere or heaven, memory
from the sphere of Saturn and so on; but Albert regards
this doctrine as simply a description of the process of fitting
the mind or soul to the body which it must occupy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Free will.</div>

<p>But the human reason and will remain free and are not
necessarily subjected to the movements of the stars. Thus
in his theological <i>Summa</i> Albert admits that the stars govern
even the souls, vegetable and sensitive, of plants and brutes,
but denies that they coerce the loftier rational soul and will
of man, who is made in the image of God, except as he
yields to sin and the flesh.<a id="FNanchor_1935" href="#Footnote_1935" class="fnanchor">[1935]</a> But this last is a very important
exception as we see from a passage in the treatise on minerals.<a id="FNanchor_1936" href="#Footnote_1936" class="fnanchor">[1936]</a>
“There is in man a double spring of action, namely,
nature and the will; and nature for its part is ruled by the
stars, while the will is free; but unless it resists, it is swept
along by nature and becomes mechanical (<i>induratur</i>).”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ptolemy
on free
will.</div>

<p>Albert is aware that neither the Peripatetic philosophy
nor the art of astrology itself slavishly subjects the human
mind and will to the stars.<a id="FNanchor_1937" href="#Footnote_1937" class="fnanchor">[1937]</a> Rather he keeps citing Ptolemy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_585">[Pg 585]</span>
to show that the astrologers themselves do not believe in
fatal necessity and that consequently the art of astrology is
not incompatible with Christianity.<a id="FNanchor_1938" href="#Footnote_1938" class="fnanchor">[1938]</a> Ptolemy declares that
the mind apprehends the superior bodies in their spheres,
and can freely turn away from those things towards which
the motions of the stars incline it, and can turn towards
other things by the wisdom of its intellect.<a id="FNanchor_1939" href="#Footnote_1939" class="fnanchor">[1939]</a> In another
passage Ptolemy is quoted as saying that the effects of the
stars can be impeded by the science of men skilled in astrology.<a id="FNanchor_1940" href="#Footnote_1940" class="fnanchor">[1940]</a>
If the average “astronomer and augur and
magician and interpreter of dreams and visions” has brought
divination into disrepute, it is, says Albert in a third passage,
because “almost all men of this class delight in deception
and, being poorly educated, they think that what is merely
contingent is necessary, and they predict that some event will
certainly occur; and when it does not, those sciences are
cheapened in the sight of unskilled men, although the defect
is not in the science, but in those who abuse it. For this
reason wise Ptolemy says that no judgment should be made
except in general terms and with the cautious reservation
that the stars act <i>per aliud et accidens</i> (subject to other
forces and to accidents) and that their significations meet
many impediments. Moreover, the pursuit of sciences dealing
with the future would be idle, if one could not avoid
what one foresaw.”<a id="FNanchor_1941" href="#Footnote_1941" class="fnanchor">[1941]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Nativities.</div>

<p>But free will no more restrains Albert than it did Ptolemy
from accepting the art of genethlialogy<a id="FNanchor_1942" href="#Footnote_1942" class="fnanchor">[1942]</a> or casting of nativities,
as his mention of royal horoscopes has already suggested.
He states elsewhere that the astrologer who understands
the virtues of the signs of the zodiac and of the stars
situated in them at the moment of birth can prognosticate
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_586">[Pg 586]</span>
so far as lies within the influence of the sky concerning the
entire life of the person born.<a id="FNanchor_1943" href="#Footnote_1943" class="fnanchor">[1943]</a> Indeed, Albert ascribed to
Ptolemy a treatise <i>De accidentibus parvis particularibus</i><a id="FNanchor_1944" href="#Footnote_1944" class="fnanchor">[1944]</a>
concerning the events in the life of the individual born under
this or that constellation, as contrasted with great social
events involving large numbers of men such as political
revolutions, racial migrations, and religious movements, of
which Ptolemy is said by Albert to have treated in another
work in eight parts called <i>De accidentibus magnis universalibus
in mundo</i>.<a id="FNanchor_1945" href="#Footnote_1945" class="fnanchor">[1945]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Galen on
the stars
and human
generation.</div>

<p>Albert even believed that the influence of the stars upon
man was stronger in some respects than upon other animals.
He attributed to Galen in the treatise <i>De spermate</i> a statement,
which I have failed to find in Galen’s <i>De semine</i> or
other works, that “in the generation of brutes the sperm
is not altered according to the order of the hours and the
operations of the planets and signs as it is in man.” Albert
prefers his own explanation of this circumstance to that
offered by Galen. It is that the human body is less material
and terrestrial than those of the brutes and more nearly
resembles the heavens, and so more readily follows the impressions
from the sky, and is a sort of microcosm as a
beast is not. On the other hand, Albert grants that changes
of the atmosphere and weather are felt more quickly by
the beasts, who have little else to distract their attention.<a id="FNanchor_1946" href="#Footnote_1946" class="fnanchor">[1946]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Plato on
boys and
the stars.</div>

<p>Albert states that Plato, as well as Ptolemy and Galen,
proved the influence of the stars upon human beings from
the case of boys, who are still too young to make much use
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_587">[Pg 587]</span>
of free will against nature and the force of the heavens.
For boys often display a special aptitude, due to celestial
influence, for some one art and become perfect workmen
if they are trained in it; but if they are forced into another
occupation, never attain proficiency therein because of their
natural ineptitude for it.<a id="FNanchor_1947" href="#Footnote_1947" class="fnanchor">[1947]</a> This is of course the same point
as was illustrated in the pseudo-Aristotelian <i>Secret of
Secrets</i> by the story of the weaver’s son whose horoscope
showed a predilection to govern, and the king’s son whose
sole interest was in the mechanical arts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The doctrine
of
elections.</div>

<p>Naturally Albert finds no difficulty in accepting the
astrological doctrine of elections, by which the astrologer
applies his knowledge of the movements and effects of the
stars and their relationships to inferior bodies to the selection
of a favorable hour for beginning a contemplated
action.<a id="FNanchor_1948" href="#Footnote_1948" class="fnanchor">[1948]</a> This doctrine of course implies and requires freedom
of election and will, and shows that astrology is an
operative as well as divining art. In another passage Albert
mentions the famous and historic, as he regards it, royal example
of eugenics, when Nectanabus, the natural father of
Alexander, in having intercourse with his mother Olympias
observed the hour when the Sun was entering Leo and
Saturn was in Taurus, since he wished his son to receive
the figure and force of those planets.<a id="FNanchor_1949" href="#Footnote_1949" class="fnanchor">[1949]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Influence
of the
stars on
works of
art.</div>

<p>If astrology is thus operative as well as divinatory by
its power to select the proper and most advantageous moment
for entering upon any course of action, and to harness
so to speak the power of the planets, it becomes evident that
it is or should be an all-important factor in all the arts.
Albert well asserts therefore that a fundamental principle
of this science is that all things which are made by nature
or art are moved first by celestial virtues. He adds that no
one doubts this concerning nature, and that it is also true of
art, in which it is the influence of the stars which incites
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_588">[Pg 588]</span>
the artist to make something.<a id="FNanchor_1950" href="#Footnote_1950" class="fnanchor">[1950]</a> The force of the stars is
potent in alchemy, for example,<a id="FNanchor_1951" href="#Footnote_1951" class="fnanchor">[1951]</a> for those who try to transmute
metals and stones produce purer metals and stones
when the moon is waxing and ascending, “and particularly
the more skilful they are, not hurrying their operations, but
awaiting the opportune time when the process is assisted
by celestial virtue.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Astrological
images.</div>

<p>Of all the arts the most astrological is that of images,
to which Albert devotes several chapters of his treatise on
minerals.<a id="FNanchor_1952" href="#Footnote_1952" class="fnanchor">[1952]</a> In it images of the stars are engraved on gems
or metals at the favorable moment when the celestial force
is strongest, “and marvels are worked by such images” because
some force from the celestial figure flows into the
work of art.<a id="FNanchor_1953" href="#Footnote_1953" class="fnanchor">[1953]</a> Incidentally Albert remarks that “in the
science of geomancy” the figures traced from the points are
of no value unless they can be made to conform to such astronomical
images. Albert mentions several particular
astronomical conditions which must be observed in engraving
such images. Gems from India are the best for this
purpose. Some images engraved in antiquity are no longer
efficacious. Albert gives a number of examples of the effects
expected from these images.<a id="FNanchor_1954" href="#Footnote_1954" class="fnanchor">[1954]</a> Stones engraved with
Aries or Leo or Sagittarius are good for fevers, dropsy,
and paralysis, and are said to make their possessors talented
and fluent and highly honored. Stones carved with Gemini
and Libra and Aquarius temper hot humors and promote
friendship, justice, civility, and observance of law.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Discussion
of fate
in the
<i>Summa
theologiae</i>.</div>

<p>In the foregoing sketch of Albert’s attitude to astrology,
based chiefly on his writings in the field of natural science,
some allusion has also been made to his discussion of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_589">[Pg 589]</span>
subject in his <i>Summa</i> of theology, which occurs in the section
<i>On fate</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1955" href="#Footnote_1955" class="fnanchor">[1955]</a> “which those maintain who deny providence”
and which is generally identified with the influence of the
stars. I have in the main, however, reserved this section for
separate treatment here, partly because it might be expected
to show a more conservative and less favorable attitude to
astrology than Albert’s scientific writings, since its authorities
would presumably be the church fathers, while the scientific
works reflect the views of Aristotle and other Greeks
and Arabs. And partly for another reason, that I am inclined
to question whether a supplementary passage at the
close of this section is by Albert or added by another hand.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Attempt
to reconcile
the
fathers
with the astronomers.</div>

<p>Although Albert in this section of the <i>Summa</i> approaches
the subject of the influence of the stars from the unfavorable
standpoint of fate instead of the favoring one of nature,
it is noteworthy that he is not content merely to reproduce
the attacks upon astrologers by Augustine and Gregory of
Nyssa, but endeavors to reconcile them with the views of
such scientific or pseudo-scientific authorities as Ptolemy,
Hermes Trismegistus, “Socrates,” and other <i>Astronomi</i>.
The keynote of his solution is found in the definition of
Boethius that “Fate is the disposition inherent in movable
things by which Providence binds each by its order.” Thus
there is no necessary conflict between Providence and the rule
of the stars. But Albert maintains that “neither fate nor
stars nor even Providence takes away from human free will
its liberty of action,”<a id="FNanchor_1956" href="#Footnote_1956" class="fnanchor">[1956]</a> quoting Ptolemy as usual to the effect
that the wise man rules the stars and that what the
stars do they do <i>per aliud et accidens</i>. Albert therefore rejects
absolute fatal necessity as heretical<a id="FNanchor_1957" href="#Footnote_1957" class="fnanchor">[1957]</a> and the doctrine
of the <i>magnus annus</i> that history repeats itself as the stars
repeat their courses as “horrible.”<a id="FNanchor_1958" href="#Footnote_1958" class="fnanchor">[1958]</a> On the other hand, he
insists that “it cannot be denied that the stars by the figures
of their positions pour radiations of diverse figures upon the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_590">[Pg 590]</span>
place of generation,”<a id="FNanchor_1959" href="#Footnote_1959" class="fnanchor">[1959]</a> or that “the stars in truth are rulers
of the world in those things which are subject to the world,”<a id="FNanchor_1960" href="#Footnote_1960" class="fnanchor">[1960]</a>
namely, things corporeal. He also admits that the soul may
be inclined to the body, though not coerced. Thus a choleric
person is likely to choose different food and occupation from
a phlegmatic one. Hence Socrates “says that voluntary elections
are made in accordance with the diversity of habits
previously existing in the chooser.”<a id="FNanchor_1961" href="#Footnote_1961" class="fnanchor">[1961]</a> But Socrates means
that such habits incline but do not compel us. Later Albert
qualifies Gregory of Nyssa’s assertion that our choosing precedes
“fortune” by again pointing out that the influence of
the stars “inclines the will to choose this or that.”<a id="FNanchor_1962" href="#Footnote_1962" class="fnanchor">[1962]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Glossing
over Augustine.</div>

<p>Albert has to force his authorities a good deal to arrive
at this compromise. Thus he interprets Augustine’s grudging
concession that it “can be said not utterly absurdly that
certain sidereal afflations effect mere differences of bodies, as
we see that the seasons of the year vary with the approach
and withdrawal of the sun and some sorts of things, such
as shellfish and the wonderful tides of ocean, increase and
diminish with the waxing and waning of the moon,”&mdash;Albert
interprets this as favoring his own much more sweeping
assertion that the stars rule the universe in most respects and
change the souls as well as the bodies of plants and brutes.<a id="FNanchor_1963" href="#Footnote_1963" class="fnanchor">[1963]</a>
Again, Augustine, asking “What is so pertinent to the body
as sex?” contended against the astrologers that twins of opposite
sex might be born under the same constellation; yet
Albert maintains that Augustine did not mean here that sex
of the body is not subject to the stars, but only that the constellations
are not the sole and entire cause of natural bodily
processes, and this for the reasons given above from Ptolemy,
namely, that the influence of the stars depends upon
the capacity of matter to receive it and operates <i>per aliud et
accidens</i>.<a id="FNanchor_1964" href="#Footnote_1964" class="fnanchor">[1964]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Christ
and the
stars.</div>

<p>In connection with the question, “Whether Christ was
subject soul and body to fate or fortune or <i>eupraxia</i>?” Albert
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_591">[Pg 591]</span>
makes an exception to the influence of the stars, and
apparently holds that even in respect to His body Christ was
not subject to the power of the constellations. The argument
is advanced that the Lawgiver is not subject to the law.
The opposing contentions that in becoming man Christ assumed
the defects of our mortality and that, since fate is
the disposition inherent in all mobile objects, Christ was
subject to fate as much as any other man,&mdash;these are denied
on the ground that Christ became man voluntarily and suffered
as man only what and when He would, and that from
the moment of conception He possessed “grace and all
knowledge.” It is also held that when the Magi said that
they had seen His star in the east, they did not mean a constellation
ruling His nativity but a new celestial sign which
demonstrated the new birth of a heavenly king.<a id="FNanchor_1965" href="#Footnote_1965" class="fnanchor">[1965]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Patristic
arguments
against
astrology
upheld,
but perhaps
not
by Albert.</div>

<p>Scarcely consistent with the apparent approval with
which Albert cited the views of the “astronomers” and such
a work as the <i>Tetrabiblos</i> or <i>Quadripartitum</i> of Ptolemy in
the preceding discussion, and with the general tone of much
of it, seems a supplementary passage at the close of this section
on fate<a id="FNanchor_1966" href="#Footnote_1966" class="fnanchor">[1966]</a> after he has apparently completed the discussion
of the four questions concerning fate which he put at
the start. In this supplementary passage are upheld against
the “calumnies” of the astrologers such objections of Augustine
and Gregory the Great to the art of nativities<a id="FNanchor_1967" href="#Footnote_1967" class="fnanchor">[1967]</a> as
that Jacob and Esau were conceived and born under the same
constellation, that a queen and slave may be conceived at the
same instant, and that there are countries where no one born
under Aquarius becomes a fisherman or under the Balances
a money-changer. The argument employed in this connection,
which we cannot follow in detail, involves such a dubious
piece of physics as that the pyramid of light which gradually
spreads from a distant luminous point exercises the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_592">[Pg 592]</span>
same force on all points lying within its base. The astronomers
would doubtless retort that the rays of light falling
perpendicularly and the shortest distance would be stronger
and more efficacious than the oblique ones, or that pyramids
must also be taken into account with the point in the object
affected and the base in the constellation. Indeed, Albert in
this very section <i>On fate</i> has previously shown<a id="FNanchor_1968" href="#Footnote_1968" class="fnanchor">[1968]</a> from the
science of perspective and <i>Liber de speculis</i> that in Ethiopia
the sun’s direct ray “reflected upon itself” produces fire and
makes the child born there fiery and black, while near the
pole the great obliquity of the incidences of the rays produces
cold and damp. For such reasons as these I am inclined to
wonder if this supplementary passage, which is not essential
to the plan or main argument of the section <i>On fate</i>, has not
been added by someone other than Albert. Whoever the
author is, he also agrees with Augustine that, when asked
to account for two persons falling sick, growing worse, and
recovering at the same times, Hippocrates gave the better
answer in saying that they were conceived and born together
of the same parents, than Posidonius did in saying that they
were born under the same constellation. For Hippocrates
named the immediate cause, whereas Posidonius mentioned
the extrinsic and indirect one, for the stars are not a cause,
it is again reiterated, except <i>per aliud et accidens</i>. But the
author, like Albert before, holds that Augustine does not
deny that there is some force from the stars inclining though
not compelling us. This is equivalent to sanctioning astrology.</p>

has always been accepted as
authentic, since its opinions in
connection with magic and astrology
are rather extreme, it may
be well to list here some early
MSS of it. Berthelot (1893) I,
290, regarded BN 6514, written
about 1300, as “almost contemporary,”
but some of the following
are older, if the dating in the
MSS catalogues is dependable.</p>

of these passages is as follows.
<i>In Evang. Matth.</i>, II, 1.
“Magi enim grammatice magni
sunt.... Nec sunt Magi malefici
sicut quidam male opinantur.
Magus enim et Mathematicus et
Incantator et Maleficus sive Necromanticus
et Ariolus et Aruspex
et Divinator differunt. Quia
Magus proprie nisi magnus est,
qui scientiam habens de omnibus
necessariis et effectibus naturarum
coniecturans aliquando mirabilia
naturae praeostendit et educit....</p>

<p>Incantator ... qui carminibus
quibusdam bestias aut herbas aut
lapides aut imagines ad quosdam
parat effectus....</p>

<p>Divinatores autem multi sunt
valde: in punctis terrae et casu
ignis et aqua et in aere divinantes....</p>

<p>Nulli istorum dediti fuerunt isti
nisi magicis hoc modo prout dictum
est. Et hoc est laudabile.”</p>

<p><i>In Daniel.</i>, I, 20. “Magi dicuntur
secundum Hieronymum quasi
magistri qui de universis philosophantur,
magi tamen specialiter
astronomi dicuntur qui in astris
futura rimantur.”</p>

<p>There is said to be another copy
at Glasgow in Hunterian, V, 6, 18.</p>

<p>I am not sure whether CUL
1175, 14th century, fols. 1-3,
“Albertus de Colonia de lapidibus,”
is a fragment of it or of
the genuine treatise on minerals.</p>

<p>In CLM 353, 13th century, the
<i>Liber de mineralibus</i> of Albertus
Magnus at fol. 69 is preceded at
fol. 55 by <i>Lapidarius</i> (<i>deest lib. I,
tract, i</i>) also ascribed to him.</p>

<p>In the notice of CLM 16129,
14th century, fols. 25-112, Alberti
Magni tractatus de passionibus
aeris et impressionibus vaporum
in alto, de mineralibus, de imaginibus
lapidum et sigillis, de
natura metallorum, it is scarcely
clear whether <i>De imaginibus lapidum
et sigillis</i> is a separate treatise
from the <i>De mineralibus</i> or
only the portion of it dealing with
astronomical images.</p>

with the <i>Centiloquium</i> ascribed to
him. He names three commentators
upon it, namely, the well-known
Arabian and Jewish authorities,
Haly and Abraham, and

(Kühn, IV, 700-701) where
Galen mentions approvingly the
theory of some Platonic masters
that the world-soul is responsible
for the marvelous process of the
formation of the foetus, but adds
that he regards it as impious and
unfitting to ascribe the generation

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Bibliographical Note.</i> A critical
biography of Aquinas has not
yet appeared. D. Prümmer began
in 1911 to publish the sources,
when he edited the hitherto unprinted
biography by Peter Calo
who wrote about 1300: <i>Fontes
Vitae S. Thomae Aquinatis notis
historicis et criticis illustrati</i>,
Fasc. I, Toulouse, 1911. Peter
Calo seems to have admitted a
great deal of legendary material.
D. J. Kennedy’s “Thomas Aquinas”
in CE profits by this publication
and contains perhaps as
good a brief sketch of Aquinas’
career as there is in English. It
also has a good bibliography. It
is, however, at variance on some
points with Thomas of Cantimpré’s
statements, as I have indicated
in the text.</p>

<p>On the bibliography of Aquinas’
own works one may consult:
C. U. J. Chevalier, <i>Catalogue
critique des œuvres de Saint
Thomas d’Aquin</i>, 1887; A. Miola,
<i>Codices MSS operum S. Thomae
de Aquino et S. Bonaventurae in
Regia Neapolitana Bibliotheca</i>,
1874; P. Mandonnet, <i>Des Écrits
Authentiques de S. Thomas
d’Aquin</i>, Fribourg, 1910. Latest
and fullest, but still leaving much
to be desired despite its 252 pages,
is A. Michelitsch, <i>Thomasschriften</i>,
1913, vol. I; which gives the
sources for Aquinas’ biography
but too briefly with arbitrary
omissions, the bare numbers of
MSS containing his works without
indication of their date or
contents, the old lists of his
writings, and a full analysis of
the printed editions. Fossi (1793-1795)
II, 663-98, lists such of
Aquinas’ works printed before
1500 as are in the Magliabechian
library at Florence.</p>

<p>Since the edition of the works
of Aquinas begun by order of
Pope Leo XIII at Rome, 1886-1906,
has never been completed,
the most useful edition and that
which I have employed remains
that by E. Fretté and P. Maré,
<i>Opera omnia</i>, Paris, 1871-1880, in
34 volumes.</p>

<p>I have not been much impressed
by the worth of such secondary
works on Aquinas and his science
as I have happened upon: for
some bibliography see Paetow
(1917), pp. 406, 408-9. Paetow
does not mention A. Farges,
<i>Études philosophiques pour vulgariser
les théories d’Aristote et
de S. Thomas et montrer leur
accord avec les sciences</i>, 1909;
A. Fisichella, <i>S. Tommaso
d’Aquino, Leone XIII e la scienza</i>,
1880; T. Gaudenzi, <i>S. Tommaso
d’Aquino e la scienza</i>. 1874;
Frohschammer, <i>Die Philosophie
des Thomas von Aquino</i>, Leipzig,
1889; nor G. M. Cornoldi (1822-1892),
<i>The Physical System of
St. Thomas</i>, English translation
by E. H. Dering, London, 1893.
The last is a Roman Catholic defense
of the natural philosophy of
Aquinas against modern science,
which obscures the facts that
Thomas held fast to the theory
of four elements and derived his
natural philosophy from Aristotle.
Overworked as the words “camouflage”
and “propaganda” are,
one is tempted to apply them in
the case of recent Aquinas literature.
At the same time it is
remarkable how few libraries have
a complete and unexpurgated edition
of his works. I have not
seen F. Tessen-Wesierski, <i>Die
Grundlagen des Wunderbegriffes
nach Thomas von Aquino</i>, 1899, in
<i>Jahrb. f. Philos, u. Spekulative
Theologie</i>.</p>

<p>The relation of Aquinas to
Dante has been the theme of
more than one work; an example
is N. Busetto, <i>Saggi di varia Psicologia
Dantesca contribute allo
studio delle relazioni di Dante con
Alberto Magno e con San Tommaso</i>,
1905.</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Precociousness
of
Aquinas.</div>

<p>Thomas Aquinas was perhaps not so precocious a genius
as some of his fellow-countrymen who were artists during
the Italian Renaissance. But if he did not die quite as young
as Masaccio or Raphael, he nevertheless produced a vast
amount of learned writing within a comparatively short time.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_594">[Pg 594]</span>
Whether we believe that he was born in 1225 or 1227, he
was not yet fifty when he died on the seventh of March,
1274. Ptolemy of Lucca, who states that he had often heard
Aquinas’ confession and had attended his lectures and been
his friend for a long time,<a id="FNanchor_1969" href="#Footnote_1969" class="fnanchor">[1969]</a> says that Thomas became a Dominican
at sixteen and “lived in pure innocence” for about
thirty-two years thereafter.<a id="FNanchor_1970" href="#Footnote_1970" class="fnanchor">[1970]</a> A passage in the <i>Compendium
studii philosophiae</i> of Roger Bacon sneers at the theological
teaching of “the boys of the two Orders,” such as Albert and
Thomas and the others who enter the Orders when twenty
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_595">[Pg 595]</span>
years or under.<a id="FNanchor_1971" href="#Footnote_1971" class="fnanchor">[1971]</a> Perhaps the names of Albert and Thomas
were not in the passage as originally penned by Bacon; Albert
at least had probably come of age before the friar orders
started, and Bacon would scarcely look back upon a man
who was his senior as a boy. But the fact remains that
Thomas at least became a Dominican at an early age.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Early life
according
to Thomas
of Cantimpré.</div>

<p>Thomas of Cantimpré tells<a id="FNanchor_1972" href="#Footnote_1972" class="fnanchor">[1972]</a> how Aquinas entered the
Dominican order at Bologna against the wishes of his family&mdash;he
was the son of the count of Aquino and the countess
of Teano&mdash;who secured a summons to the papal court where
he was ordered to put off the friar’s dress and be invested
with ecclesiastical office. When he refused, his two brothers
secretly seized him and shut him up in prison where he suffered
from want, cold, and poverty, and further from
women whom his brothers introduced to tempt him. He remained
thus imprisoned “for two or three years” according
to Thomas of Cantimpré, until master John of the Dominicans
complained to the emperor Frederick II who secured
Aquinas’ release and would, according to Thomas
of Cantimpré, have put his brothers to death for
their inhumanity but for master John’s further intervention.
Master John then shipped Aquinas off to Paris, but his
brothers and friends at the papal court had him again summoned
thither, and he was offered the post of abbot of Monte
Cassino “under whom are seven bishops and who himself
exercises the pontifical office.” The pope was ready to allow
him to continue to wear the Dominican costume in this position,
but Aquinas fled a second time from the papal court
and came to Cologne and studied there until Albert was transferred
to Paris and given the chair of theology there for his
incomparable learning. “After whom,” continues Cantimpré,
“also this same brother Thomas gained a position and
chair of similar importance.” The meaning of this last sentence
is somewhat doubtful. Is “after” used in the sense of
time or of precedence in dignity? Did Aquinas hold a position
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_596">[Pg 596]</span>
at the same time with and second only to Albert, or did
he obtain the chair only after Albert had ceased to hold it?
Chronological considerations make the latter more probable.
But was the chair in question at Cologne or at Paris?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Is Thomas
of Cantimpré’s
account
reliable?</div>

<p>This passage from Thomas of Cantimpré is at variance
on a number of points with the accounts usually given of
Aquinas’ life. For instance, it makes him join the Dominicans
at Bologna, not at Naples, and represents the pope as
siding with his family in their efforts to keep Aquinas out of
the Dominican Order instead of delivering Aquinas from
the persecution of his family. But Thomas of Cantimpré
apparently penned his passage during Aquinas’ lifetime and
it is probably a half century nearer the events than the <i>Lives</i>
of Aquinas written in the early fourteenth century and upon
which most modern accounts are based. At the same time it
must be admitted that Cantimpré seems to write in a loose
and exaggerated manner which does not command much
confidence. But I suspect that he is the ultimate source of
most of the later accounts covering the same ground.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ptolemy
of Lucca
on his
early life.</div>

<p>Ptolemy of Lucca, who may be regarded as an independent
witness in view of his personal friendship with Aquinas,
states that Thomas was of noble origin and descended from
great counts of the kingdom of Apulia, that his family were
faithful to the pope against the emperor Frederick II, and
that Thomas was educated as a boy in the monastery of
Monte Cassino. When he joined the Dominicans at sixteen,
his relations kidnapped him, but he escaped to Rome and
from there went off to Cologne to become Albert’s pupil.
At the age of twenty-five he came to Paris where before his
thirtieth year he lectured on the <i>Sentences</i> and received his
degree in theology. Before receiving the degree he had written
a commentary on the <i>Sentences</i> and a treatise against
William of St. Amour. As William of St. Amour was not
condemned by the pope until October, 1256, and as the friars
were not admitted to the doctorate in theology at Paris until
1257 or 1258, Ptolemy’s statements would indicate that
Thomas was not born until 1227.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_597">[Pg 597]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Date and
place of
his studies
with
Albert.</div>

<p>On the other hand, the assertions of both Cantimpré and
Ptolemy of Lucca that Aquinas studied with Albert at Cologne
before Albert was called to Paris, do not fit in any too
well with the usual dating of Albert’s Paris residence as
from 1245 to 1248, when he is again supposed to have returned
to Cologne. Consequently Peter of Prussia in his
fifteenth century life of Albertus Magnus held that Aquinas
spent two periods of study with Albert at Cologne, one before
and the other after Albert’s teaching at Paris.<a id="FNanchor_1973" href="#Footnote_1973" class="fnanchor">[1973]</a> Similarly
von Hertling<a id="FNanchor_1974" href="#Footnote_1974" class="fnanchor">[1974]</a> gives 1245-1252 as the duration of
Aquinas’ studies with Albert, after which he returned to
Paris alone.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His closing
years.</div>

<p>Only sixteen or seventeen years of life remained to
Aquinas after he received his degree in theology. Ptolemy
of Lucca states that he remained in Paris for only three
years after receiving the degree, when he returned to Italy,
where during the pontificates of Urban IV (1261-1264)
and Clement IV (1265-1268) he resided at Viterbo, Orvieto,
and Rome, and was offered but declined the archbishopric of
Naples. During these same years Ptolemy places most of
his chief works. In 1268 or 1269 he returned to Paris, but
died in Italy in 1274.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His success
as
a theologian.</div>

<p>Aquinas rapidly attained great success as a teacher and
authority as a theologian during his lifetime and seems still
to be regarded as the greatest and most authoritative of the
orthodox medieval theologians. This success was probably
due to the fact that he did just a little better than anyone else
what a great many had been and were trying to do, and that
was to combine all previous Christian thinking into one systematic
and consistent and moderate whole. Aquinas was
probably not the most brilliant or original mind of his generation,
but probably his teaching and writing were clearer
to a greater number of students, and seemed sounder to a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_598">[Pg 598]</span>
greater number of the thinkers of the time than the lectures
or books of any other contemporary. He put matters
clearly, concisely, moderately, and convincingly; and struck
the golden mean as it were. We can see how he may have
profited immensely by the work of predecessors like William
of Auvergne and Albertus Magnus, and yet how his works
would tend to supplant theirs. Moreover, the task at which
he had been working was not one which admitted of infinite
improvement. It was largely a problem of combining, classifying,
reconciling, and presenting the views of previous
generations and periods, and when this was once well done,
there was no need of doing it again. The attitude therefore
of Aquinas toward magic and witchcraft, astrology and divination,
and other occult arts and sciences, and also toward
natural science is quite important for us to note, since he
summed up previous Christian thought so satisfactorily,
since he was both the most popular and the most moderate
teacher of his own time, and since his opinions upon these
subjects remained for centuries acceptable and authoritative
to the Roman Catholic Church.<a id="FNanchor_1975" href="#Footnote_1975" class="fnanchor">[1975]</a> At the same time for these
very reasons we must not expect to find him putting forward
any new and unusual views upon these points.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His commentaries
on Aristotle.</div>

<p>Aquinas was not merely a theologian in a narrow and
restricted sense of that word, but was also noted as a commentator
on Aristotle.<a id="FNanchor_1976" href="#Footnote_1976" class="fnanchor">[1976]</a> Ptolemy of Lucca tells us that “he
expounded practically all philosophy, whether moral or
natural, but especially ethics and mathematics.” These lectures,
however, were not all published. Thomas did not
comment on as many of the Aristotelian works as Albert did,
and several of his commentaries were left unfinished and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_599">[Pg 599]</span>
were completed by others such as Peter of Auvergne.
Thomas has sometimes been given credit for bringing about
and using as the basis of his commentaries a new translation
of Aristotle, made directly from the Greek and presumably
executed by William of Moerbeke,<a id="FNanchor_1977" href="#Footnote_1977" class="fnanchor">[1977]</a> although, as we
have already noted in the case of Peter of Prussia’s <i>Life of
Albertus Magnus</i>, some say by Thomas of Cantimpré. It is
true that William of Moerbeke translated some of the works
of Aristotle, but I cannot find that anyone has ever identified
a signed translation by him with the text used by Aquinas
or otherwise adequately demonstrated that they worked in
concert.<a id="FNanchor_1978" href="#Footnote_1978" class="fnanchor">[1978]</a> Even if Aquinas instigated William’s translations
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_600">[Pg 600]</span>
from Aristotle, he could not have taken full advantage of
them, since some of William’s work of translation was executed
after Aquinas’ death.<a id="FNanchor_1979" href="#Footnote_1979" class="fnanchor">[1979]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
spheres of
theology
and
science.</div>

<p>We must not think of Aquinas’ studies in secular philosophy
and science as simply aimed to render these subjects
serviceable and innocuous to Christian theology. He was
too much a student of Albertus Magnus for that, and his
study of Greek thought and natural science broadened his
outlook beyond that of theology in a narrow sense. He believed,
moreover, that to a large extent the fields of theology
and natural science were distinct; that pure theologians
should not try to settle purely philosophical or scientific problems,
of which they knew little. Christians who deny as contrary
to their faith the philosophical solutions of problems
which are really indifferent so far as the Faith is concerned,
simply bring Christianity, in Aquinas’ opinion, into disrepute
among the wise men of this world.<a id="FNanchor_1980" href="#Footnote_1980" class="fnanchor">[1980]</a> Conversely every theory
of an ancient philosopher or hypothesis of science is not to
be accepted as of equal rank with religious dogmas. When
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_601">[Pg 601]</span>
John of Vercelli submitted a list of questions upon which he
desired, first, the opinions of the saints, and secondly, the
opinion of Aquinas himself, Thomas protested at the start
that some of the inquiries had nothing to do with the Christian
faith but were purely physical.<a id="FNanchor_1981" href="#Footnote_1981" class="fnanchor">[1981]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Aquinas
as a
scientist.</div>

<p>Furthermore we must keep in mind that Aquinas was
something of a scientist himself. It is interesting to note
that after his death the University of Paris wrote to the
general chapter of the Dominicans, not only lamenting his
death as an irreparable loss and asking that his bones might
be sent to Paris for burial, but also requesting the transmission
of certain books begun by him while at the university
and not as yet completed upon his departure from Paris.<a id="FNanchor_1982" href="#Footnote_1982" class="fnanchor">[1982]</a>
What were these writings: theological treatises, commentaries
on the minor prophets, or manuals of devotion? None
of these. They were a commentary on the philosopher Simplicius,
another on the <i>De coelo et mundo</i> of Aristotle,<a id="FNanchor_1983" href="#Footnote_1983" class="fnanchor">[1983]</a> a
third on the <i>Timaeus</i> of Plato, and finally a work on irrigation
and mechanical engineering.<a id="FNanchor_1984" href="#Footnote_1984" class="fnanchor">[1984]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Inferior
to Albert.</div>

<p>Thomas, however, did no such important work in natural
science as Albert. His commentaries upon Aristotle follow
the text closely and do little more than expound it; they are
not full of long digressions and additions, as Albert’s are.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_602">[Pg 602]</span>
Thomas did not found an experimental school and had not
himself devoted the long years of personal experience and
observation to nature that his master had. And he seems to
have had the less original and observant mind of the two.
But his wide reading, his clear thinking, his well-ordered
class-room presentation of material and arguments, and his
broad yet moderate views insured his instant and permanent
success in the field of theology, where the paths were already
well trod, and it only remained for someone to put everything
into as perfect and final a form as possible. In natural
science, on the other hand, the labor that awaited men was
not merely the lucid combination of Aristotelian and Arabic
thinking with previous Christian thought, but the pioneer
work of personal observation and experiment and the far
more difficult combination of these with existing theories.
Aquinas was a perfecter according to the standards of his
own age; Albert sometimes was a pioneer in the spirit of
the new age of science.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Aquinas’
theological
approach
to
the subject
of magic.</div>

<p>In view of this distinction between the two men it is
perhaps not surprising that what Aquinas has to say concerning
magic, even in the broad use of that term, occurs to
a large extent in his theological writings. Just as, although
Albert was a distinguished theologian, we viewed magic in
his works largely as connected with science; so, although
Aquinas studied and wrote of secular philosophy and science,
we find in him a moderate, enlightened, and highly influential
statement of the attitude of Christian theological
scholarship towards magic, witchcraft, and astrology. In
his account of magic so-called in his <i>Summa</i>, <i>Contra Gentiles</i>,
and <i>De potentia</i>, he seems to follow Augustine a good
deal, and like him he makes considerable use of Porphyry’s
<i>Letter to Anebo</i>. Aquinas accepts the essential features of
the previous theological definition of magic, as Albert did
in his <i>theological</i> treatises.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Miracle
distinguished.</div>

<p>Aquinas carefully distinguishes magic from miracle.<a id="FNanchor_1985" href="#Footnote_1985" class="fnanchor">[1985]</a> A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_603">[Pg 603]</span>
miracle is contrary to the order of all created nature and can
be performed by God alone. Many things that seem marvelous
to us or of which the cause is hidden from us are not,
strictly speaking, miraculous. An eclipse seems a miracle to
some ignorant people, but not to a philosopher who understands
its cause. Other seeming marvels which are not divine
miracles are the occult virtues of physical bodies “for
which a reason cannot be assigned by man,”<a id="FNanchor_1986" href="#Footnote_1986" class="fnanchor">[1986]</a> and the effects
produced in our lower world by the influence of the constellations.
Even more difficult of human comprehension
are the doings of demons, who, Aquinas is convinced, can
not only deceive the senses and affect the human imagination,
but also truly transform bodies. Yet even their feats are
not true miracles in violation of natural order; they simply
add to the marvelous virtues of physical objects and the
potent influences of the stars something of their own peculiar
powers. After all, their feats can be explained, they
operate by means of art; God alone is a cause absolutely
hidden from every man.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reality
of magic
affirmed.</div>

<p>As for magicians, in their feats they make use of herbs
and other physical bodies: of words, usually in the form of
“invocations, supplications, and adjurations”; they also employ
figures and characters, sacrifices and prostrations,
images and rites, carefully observed times, constellations,
and other considerations.<a id="FNanchor_1987" href="#Footnote_1987" class="fnanchor">[1987]</a> As a result the whereabouts of
stolen objects is disclosed, hidden treasure is found, the
future is revealed, closed doors mysteriously open, men become
invisible, inanimate bodies move and speak, apparitions
of rational beings are summoned and answer questions.
Some contend that such apparitions are imaginary,
but Aquinas replies that on such occasions third parties have
been present whose senses were working normally and who
also witnessed the apparitions, and furthermore that no phantom
of our imagination could reveal things of which we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_604">[Pg 604]</span>
ourselves were ignorant. In the reality of such feats of
magic, then, Thomas firmly believes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Magic not
a science
but due to
demons.</div>

<p>But Aquinas will not admit that the magician and his
materials are a sufficient cause of the magic. He also denies
that certain men are especially endowed with magic power
by the stars at their birth or that the influence of the constellations
can be controlled to perform particular feats of
magic. Demons in his opinion really perform the magic.
Words, figures, spells are mere signs to them; the poor magician
is their dupe. It looks, Thomas admits, as if spirits
came only when invoked, and as if they often came unwillingly,
and sometimes performed good deeds at the magician’s
bidding which must be very distasteful to them as evil beings.
But in all this they are simply deceiving mankind. “It
is not true then,” says Aquinas, “that the magic arts are
sciences, but rather they are certain fallacies of the demons.”<a id="FNanchor_1988" href="#Footnote_1988" class="fnanchor">[1988]</a>
In discussing the “notory art,” which professes to
acquire knowledge by fasting, prayers to God, figures, and
strange words, he declares that demons cannot illuminate the
intellect, although they may express in words some smattering
of the sciences.<a id="FNanchor_1989" href="#Footnote_1989" class="fnanchor">[1989]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">And is
evil.</div>

<p>Aquinas further charges that the practitioners of magic
are generally criminals, perpetrating illicit deeds, adulteries,
thefts, and homicides, a fact which has gained for magicians
the further name of evil-doers, i. e. <i>malefici</i> (sorcerers).
At best magic does not aid man in science or virtue, but in
trivial matters such as the discovery of stolen goods.<a id="FNanchor_1990" href="#Footnote_1990" class="fnanchor">[1990]</a> Aquinas
repeats the criticism of Porphyry in <i>The Letter to Anebo</i>
that the methods of magic are immoral. Therefore it is
wrong to seek to learn “the magic sciences” in order to use
them, but permissible to study them in order to confute them.
Aquinas then makes haste to correct this phrase “magic
sciences,” as we have already noted above.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Some
regard
magic as a
human art
or science.</div>

<p>But by his own denial Aquinas makes it sufficiently evident
that many men of his time thought the magic arts
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_605">[Pg 605]</span>
sciences, and that magicians believed themselves able by personal
qualifications, by subtle use of occult natural properties,
by rites and ceremonies, and by the art of astrology,
either to work wonders directly and immediately or to coerce
demons to work wonders for them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Aquinas
believes
in witchcraft.</div>

<p>In lending the authority of his name to an affirmation
of the reality of demon-magic, Aquinas must share together
with many writers before and after him responsibility for
the witchcraft delusion and executions. And yet he tells us
that there were already some persons by his time who denied
that there was any such thing as witchcraft except in men’s
imaginations and fears. Such persons argued that where
the supposed sorcery was not entirely due to imaginary terror,
it could be explained as the natural effect of occult
causes. But Aquinas, who twice argues the question whether
the consummation of marriage can be prevented by sorcery,<a id="FNanchor_1991" href="#Footnote_1991" class="fnanchor">[1991]</a>
declares that the authority of the saints and of the Catholic
faith alike proclaim the reality of witchcraft and its power
to obstruct carnal union. Men who dispute this are the
same as denying the existence of the demons.<a id="FNanchor_1992" href="#Footnote_1992" class="fnanchor">[1992]</a> Dear demons!
What a treasured legacy of theology from paganism!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Divination.</div>

<p>Aquinas also tends to follow ecclesiastical tradition in
condemning most arts of divination as the work of demons,<a id="FNanchor_1993" href="#Footnote_1993" class="fnanchor">[1993]</a>
and in carefully distinguishing from them divine prophecy,
which can speak with certainty even of contingent matters.<a id="FNanchor_1994" href="#Footnote_1994" class="fnanchor">[1994]</a>
He grants, however, that some arts of divination have a
natural basis, and that natural divination is permissible, if
not extended to accidental occurrences and to human acts due
to the reason and will.<a id="FNanchor_1995" href="#Footnote_1995" class="fnanchor">[1995]</a> It is possible to forecast the future
by interpretation of dreams which are produced by natural
causes either within or outside the sleeper’s body.<a id="FNanchor_1996" href="#Footnote_1996" class="fnanchor">[1996]</a> The
commentary of Aquinas on Aristotle’s <i>De somno et vigilia</i> is,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_606">[Pg 606]</span>
however, a perfunctory treatise, inferior to that by Albertus
Magnus on the same theme, and advances no ideas of
Thomas’ own on the subject of divination from dreams.
Even augury may be natural divination, if the acts of the
animals under observation are governed by the positions and
movements of the stars.<a id="FNanchor_1997" href="#Footnote_1997" class="fnanchor">[1997]</a> Aquinas also mentions chiromancy
without disapproval, but will not admit that geomancy comes
under the head of natural divination, since the figures upon
which its predictions are based are the outcome either of
chance or of voluntary human action.<a id="FNanchor_1998" href="#Footnote_1998" class="fnanchor">[1998]</a> He condemns as superstitious
the regarding as signs of the future such trivial
occurrences as a sneeze or a dog’s running between two persons
who are walking together.<a id="FNanchor_1999" href="#Footnote_1999" class="fnanchor">[1999]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Lot
casting.</div>

<p>Lot casting of whatever sort is not natural divination.
The Bible tells us, however, that God often rules the casting
of lots, and “if practices which have a natural or human
cause are blameless, much more so are those which depend
on divine aid.”<a id="FNanchor_2000" href="#Footnote_2000" class="fnanchor">[2000]</a> But Aquinas cautions against an appeal
to God to decide the casting of lots unless there is real necessity,
or without due reverence and devotion, or for purely
human and worldly purposes, or in cases where direct divine
inspiration should be sought, as in ecclesiastical elections.
As Bede pointed out, it is true that Matthias was selected by
lot before Pentecost, but after the reception of the Holy
Ghost the seven deacons were elected by the disciples. And
when men pry into hidden things more than they should,
whether by lot casting or other methods, it is Aquinas’ opinion
that demons are involved.<a id="FNanchor_2001" href="#Footnote_2001" class="fnanchor">[2001]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_607">[Pg 607]</span></p><div class="sidenote">Occult
virtues.</div>

<p>As Aquinas differentiated between natural divination and
that due to demons, so he distinguishes from illicit magic
“the occult works of nature.” On this theme he addressed a
brief treatise to “a certain knight.”<a id="FNanchor_2002" href="#Footnote_2002" class="fnanchor">[2002]</a> Besides those properties
of natural objects which accord with the properties of
their component elements and so have a manifest origin,
there are occult virtues for which men can give no reason,<a id="FNanchor_2003" href="#Footnote_2003" class="fnanchor">[2003]</a>
as in the stock illustration of the magnet, as great a favorite
with medieval writers as electricity is with modern preachers
to inspire faith in the invisible and imperfectly known.
Aquinas accounts for the existence of such occult virtues by
the influence of the heavenly bodies upon the world of nature.
In his <i>Meteorology</i>, too, he attributes the wonderful
powers of precious stones to “a certain celestial and occult
virtue.”<a id="FNanchor_2004" href="#Footnote_2004" class="fnanchor">[2004]</a> In this he probably shows the influence of his
master Albertus Magnus.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Alchemy
and fascination.</div>

<p>Aquinas declares that alchemy is a true, although difficult
art, and accounts for the efficacy of its operations by its
utilization of occult forces of celestial virtue.<a id="FNanchor_2005" href="#Footnote_2005" class="fnanchor">[2005]</a> Pico della
Mirandola noted that while Thomas seemed to deny the art
in his <i>Commentary on the Sentences</i>, he approved it in his
theological <i>Summa</i>, which Pico accepted as his last word on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_608">[Pg 608]</span>
the subject.<a id="FNanchor_2006" href="#Footnote_2006" class="fnanchor">[2006]</a> Spurious works of alchemy were, however,
subsequently ascribed to Aquinas in manuscripts of the fifteenth
century. Fascination Aquinas also regards as a fact,
and practically explains it as due to the power of the evil eye.
The eye is affected by the strong imagination of the soul and
then corrupts and poisons the atmosphere so that tender
bodies coming within its range may be injuriously affected.
It is thus that malicious old women injure children,<a id="FNanchor_2007" href="#Footnote_2007" class="fnanchor">[2007]</a>&mdash;another
faggot added by Aquinas to the pyres of the witchcraft
delusion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Amulets
and incantations.</div>

<p>We have hitherto found the practices of wearing amulets
and repeating incantations apt to accompany the belief in
occult virtues. Aquinas, in discussing “the suspension of
sacred words about the neck” cautions that “in all incantations
and suspensions of writings” what is written should
be seemly, should not be an invocation of demons, should
contain no unknown words which may have an evil meaning,
and should contain no characters other than the sign of
the cross. He quotes the decretal forbidding other observances
in collecting medicinal herbs than the sign of the cross
and repetition of the Lord’s prayer. And he concludes that
“suspending divine words about the neck, assuming that they
contain nothing false or doubtful, is certainly permissible,
but it would be more laudable to abstain from such practices.”<a id="FNanchor_2008" href="#Footnote_2008" class="fnanchor">[2008]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Attitude
to astrology.</div>

<p>Already a number of passages have shown incidentally
that Thomas, like his master Albert, ascribed an important
place in natural science to astrological theory. Although he
refused to explain magic as worked by the stars, he accounted
for the occult works of nature and for natural divination
by astral influence. He grants the nobility and incorruptibility
of the heavenly bodies but, although aware that Plato and
Aristotle attributed souls and intelligences to them, insists
that they are material substances. But he regards the stars as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_609">[Pg 609]</span>
<i>media</i> between “the separate intelligences” and our material
world and is inclined to answer affirmatively a question
which was more than once put to him, namely, Do the angels
move the stars?<a id="FNanchor_2009" href="#Footnote_2009" class="fnanchor">[2009]</a> He also frequently affirms, both in the
course of his chief works and in briefer answers to special
inquiries that God rules inferior through superior creatures
and earthly bodies by the stars.<a id="FNanchor_2010" href="#Footnote_2010" class="fnanchor">[2010]</a> No wise man doubts that
all natural motions of inferior bodies are caused by the movement
of the celestial bodies.<a id="FNanchor_2011" href="#Footnote_2011" class="fnanchor">[2011]</a> Reason and experience, saints
and philosophers, have proved it over and over again.
Aquinas then cites two passages from Augustine<a id="FNanchor_2012" href="#Footnote_2012" class="fnanchor">[2012]</a> and Dionysius<a id="FNanchor_2013" href="#Footnote_2013" class="fnanchor">[2013]</a>
which do not seem so sweeping as his own assertion:
Augustine affirming merely that “grosser and inferior bodies
are ruled by subtler and superior ones according to a certain
order,” and Dionysius saying simply that the rays of the sun
aid in the generation of life and nourish and increase and
perfect it. Indeed, throughout his arguments for astrology
Aquinas, like Albert, seems to stretch authorities upon a
Procrustean bed of citation and to make church fathers who
are famed for their attacks on astrologers seem to favor the
limited rule of the stars over all nature. Aquinas further
deems an art of judicial astrology possible, asserting that,
besides the crude prognostications which sailors and farmers
make from the sky, it is feasible “by some other more
occult observations of the stars to employ judicial astrology
concerning corporeal effects.”<a id="FNanchor_2014" href="#Footnote_2014" class="fnanchor">[2014]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Extent of
and limits
to the influence
of
the stars
upon man.</div>

<p>But Aquinas declares that the human will is free and that
the soul as an intellectual substance cannot be coerced by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_610">[Pg 610]</span>
corporeal substances, however superior. He also opines that
many occurrences are accidental rather than due to the stars,
“as when a man digging a grave finds buried treasure.”<a id="FNanchor_2015" href="#Footnote_2015" class="fnanchor">[2015]</a>
And “no natural agent can incline one to that which happens
accidentally.” Aquinas like Albert is also aware, however,
that the astrologers themselves agree that the wise man rules
the stars, and conversely he himself recognizes that man is
not purely an intellectual being, that he often obeys sensual
appetite, and that even the mind derives its knowledge from
the senses and consequently in a condition disturbed by phantasy.
Thus the stars may indirectly affect the human intellect
to a considerable extent.<a id="FNanchor_2016" href="#Footnote_2016" class="fnanchor">[2016]</a> Aquinas is also ready to admit
that astrologers often make true predictions in events
where large numbers of men are concerned and the passions
of the majority override the wisdom and will of the few who
are able to resist such impulses. On the other hand, he holds
that astrologers often err in their predictions concerning
individuals.<a id="FNanchor_2017" href="#Footnote_2017" class="fnanchor">[2017]</a> This perhaps refers only to prediction of nativities,
for Peter of Prussia, in defending Albertus Magnus
against the charge of indulgence in too curious arts, asserted
that Aquinas “nowhere in his writings” reproved or attacked
astrological interrogations.<a id="FNanchor_2018" href="#Footnote_2018" class="fnanchor">[2018]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Power of
astrological
images
denied.</div>

<p>The question remains, to what extent can men voluntarily
avail themselves of the celestial virtues? Aquinas takes
the position that men can make use of such virtues only as
they find them already existing in nature and that works of
human art, as distinct from natural objects, receive no new
virtue from the stars but only from the human operator,&mdash;“from
the conception of the artificer.” It is for this reason
that Aquinas refuses to explain many operations of magicians
as produced by the aid of the constellations. In particular
he denies that gems engraved with astronomical figures
receive any more virtue from the stars than other gems
of the same species without the carving. Figures and characters
and human words are immaterial and do not exert
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_611">[Pg 611]</span>
force upon matter. If, therefore, astronomical or necromantic
or magic images and characters seem to produce marvelous
effects, it must be because they are illicitly employed
as secret signs to demons who really achieve the results.<a id="FNanchor_2019" href="#Footnote_2019" class="fnanchor">[2019]</a>
In short, Aquinas’ position concerning images and characters
is that of William of Auvergne rather than that of Albertus
Magnus.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Magi
and the
star.</div>

<p>Aquinas discusses the problem of the star of Bethlehem
both in his <i>Commentary on Matthew</i><a id="FNanchor_2020" href="#Footnote_2020" class="fnanchor">[2020]</a> and in the <i>Summa</i>,<a id="FNanchor_2021" href="#Footnote_2021" class="fnanchor">[2021]</a>
and the interest which such subjects had for his contemporaries
is further shown by these questions which were put to
him, “Did the little hands of the infant Jesus create stars?”
and “Did the star which appeared to the Magi have the shape
of a cross or human form?”<a id="FNanchor_2022" href="#Footnote_2022" class="fnanchor">[2022]</a> The first question was probably
suggested by the apocryphal gospels, the second by the
homily of the Pseudo-Chrysostom which we have already
considered. Aquinas’ discussion of the star and Magi is
somewhat fuller than that by Abelard but equally drawn
from the fathers, especially Chrysostom and Augustine.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_612">[Pg 612]</span><a id="FNanchor_2023" href="#Footnote_2023" class="fnanchor">[2023]</a>
Like them he contends that the incident lends no support to
the doctrine of nativities. He saves the Magi, however,
from the imputation of being workers of magic and dupes
of the demons, adopting Jerome’s oft-repeated explanation
that while in common speech <i>magi</i> are the same as enchanters,
in the Persian language the word designates philosophers
and sages. In this case Aquinas does not force his authorities
at all; on the contrary he makes no attempt to improve
upon their captious, sophistical, and unconvincing arguments.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Is the
<i>De fato</i>
spurious?</div>

<p>The earliest bibliography of Aquinas’ works seems to be
that which Ptolemy of Lucca, who had known him personally,
gives in his <i>Ecclesiastical History</i>.<a id="FNanchor_2024" href="#Footnote_2024" class="fnanchor">[2024]</a> Among the <i>Opuscula</i>,
which Ptolemy lists with considerable care, giving their
<i>Incipits</i> as well as their titles, appears the treatise <i>De fato</i>.<a id="FNanchor_2025" href="#Footnote_2025" class="fnanchor">[2025]</a>
It also appears in the <i>Table of writings of the Order of
Preachers</i>, a bibliography completed in the second quarter of
the fourteenth century.<a id="FNanchor_2026" href="#Footnote_2026" class="fnanchor">[2026]</a> It is not, however, in the official
list of Thomas’ works drawn up preliminary to his canonization
in 1323, and which Father Mandonnet would accept
as an absolute criterion of the authentic writings of Aquinas.
Other early catalogues of Aquinas’ writings are all derived
from one of these three prototypes.<a id="FNanchor_2027" href="#Footnote_2027" class="fnanchor">[2027]</a> Our treatise has also
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_613">[Pg 613]</span>
been attributed to Albertus Magnus,<a id="FNanchor_2028" href="#Footnote_2028" class="fnanchor">[2028]</a> and much of its attitude
toward astrology and other occult arts is just the opposite
of Thomas’ position elsewhere as we have already
noted it. I have therefore reserved the <i>De fato</i> for separate
consideration. This problem of “fate” also sometimes
formed the subject of a section of theological <i>Summae</i> or
other long works, as we have seen in the case of Albertus
Magnus, and the manuscripts contain other separate discussions
of it<a id="FNanchor_2029" href="#Footnote_2029" class="fnanchor">[2029]</a> than this one associated with Aquinas. As
might be expected there is a general resemblance between
the aspects of the problem considered and the authorities
cited in all these treatises. No doubt it was a common topic
of scholastic disputation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fate and
the stars.</div>

<p>Fate is defined in our treatise as the power of the stars
exercised through their movements and relations to one another.
After citing in typical scholastic fashion a number
of authorities <i>pro</i> and <i>con</i>,&mdash;Aristotle and Boethius are made
to supply many arguments for astrology; and after agreeing
with most of the favoring arguments and answering some of
the opposing ones, the author finally concludes that fate in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_614">[Pg 614]</span>
this sense does prevail. But he distinguishes between fate
and fatal necessity, holding that the stars do not impose
fatal necessity upon inferiors. While their own motion
is “necessary, inevitable, and inalterable, ... in things generated
it is received mutably and contingently because of their
changeable natures.” Like Aquinas and other authors, he
then approvingly quotes Ptolemy’s familiar qualification that
the stars exert their influence <i>per aliud et per accidens</i> and
that “the wise man rules the stars.” Properties of inferior
objects may be used by man to counteract the effects of the
constellations, or imaginations of the mind may operate to
weaken their force. The author then argues that fate as he
has defined it is knowable, in other words that the art of astrology
is practicable, that the influence of the stars can be
discerned and measured. He goes so far as to defend the
assertion of Ptolemy that “when the luminaries are in the
head of Algon, that is, of the Gorgon, if Mars shines in hostile
aspect, the child then born will be mutilated of hands and
feet, and crucified.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Contradictions
between
<i>De
fato</i> and
other
works of
Aquinas.</div>

<p>The <i>De fato</i> seems at variance with the opinions of
Aquinas as expressed elsewhere upon the following points.
It correctly cites Boethius’ <i>De consolatione philosophiae</i> that
the incident of finding hidden treasure while digging a grave
is an example of “the inevitable connection of causes which
proceeds from the fount of the knowledge of God,” whereas
Aquinas incorrectly cited it as an illustration of an accidental
event. Again, the author of <i>De fato</i> regards the story of
the Magi and the star of Bethlehem as an evidence of the
truth of astrology. He also seems to believe that “intelligence
through the motion of the sky rules and causes the intellectual
operations of the soul,” which Aquinas refused to
concede. <i>De fato</i> also explains fascination somewhat differently
from Aquinas. It appears to agree with him that the
soul of the person exercising the power of fascination affects
the person fascinated through the sense of sight; but it suggests
that the soul of the fascinator has been endowed by the
stars with power over the soul of the fascinated, whereas
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_615">[Pg 615]</span>
Aquinas denied that certain men were made magicians by
their nativities. Finally <i>De fato</i> does not, like Aquinas, reject
astrological images, but declares that celestial influence
is received by artificial as well as by natural objects, “and
therefore the figures of magic images are engraved according
to the constellations.”</p>

hold upon the later middle ages
may be had from the list of his

contained in the Magliabechian
library at Florence: F. Fossi,

<p><a id="Footnote_1977" href="#FNanchor_1977" class="label">[1977]</a> Thus Rashdall, <i>The Universities
of Europe in the Middle
Ages</i>, 1895, I, 361, says, “Thomas
Aquinas endeavored to procure
better translations from the original
Greek, and his efforts were
seconded by Pope Urban IV.
Special translations or special revisions
of the existing Graeco-Latin
translations were prepared
for his use by a Dominican Friar
of Greek birth, variously known
as Wilhelmus de Brabantia or
Wilhelmus de Moerbeka. To him
at least the common tradition of
the Middle Ages ascribes the
<i>translatio nova</i> of the books of
Natural and Moral Philosophy,
which, in spite of many imperfections,
held its place in the schools
as a kind of authorized version of
Aristotle till the dawn of the
New Learning.” Citing Jourdain,
<i>Recherches</i>, p. 67, <i>et seq.</i>; Denifle,
<i>Archiv</i>, II, 226-7. William the
Fleming, as he is also called, was
scarcely of Greek birth, but of
course finally became archbishop
of Corinth.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1978" href="#FNanchor_1978" class="label">[1978]</a> In the 14th century bibliography
of writings by Dominicans,
Denifle (1886), p. 237, it is stated
that William of Brabant, archbishop
of Corinth (he became so
in 1277 after Aquinas’ death),
“translated all the books of natural
and moral philosophy from
Greek into Latin at the instance of
brother Thomas.” But of the
numerous signed translations by
William extant very few are of
works by Aristotle. Moreover,
is the Thomas here mentioned
Aquinas? The very next name
in the bibliography in question to
follow this Wilhelmus Brabantinus
is Thomas Brabantinus or
Thomas of Cantimpré, who may
have been the person to suggest
the translation to his fellow Fleming.
However, Aquinas and
William were both connected with
the popes in Italy in the 1260’s,
and Aquinas would seem to have
had more interest in a translation
of Aristotle than Albert’s other
“auditor,” Thomas of Cantimpré.</p>

<p>The following extracts from
medieval chronicles specifically
mention Aquinas, but as their
dates are obviously incorrect not
much reliance is to be placed upon
them.</p>

<p><i>In Chronico Slavicorum apud
Lindenbrogium ad annum 1249.</i>
“Wilhelmus de Brabantia Ordinis
Praedicatorum transtulit omnes
libros Aristotelis de graeco in
Latinum verbum a verbo (qua
translatione scholares adhuc hodierna
die utuntur in scholis) ad
instantiam sancti Thomae de
Aquino Doctoris.”</p>

<p><i>In Chronico Susati, quod MS
servat Veneta SS. Ioannis et Pauli
bibliotheca.</i> “Anno Domini 1267
fr. Wilhelmus Brabantinus, corinthiensis
de Ordine fratrum Praedicatorum,
rebus excessit humanis,
baccalarius in theologia. Hic
transtulit omnes libros Aristotelis
Rationalis Naturalis et Moralis
Philosophiae et Metaphysicae de
graeco in latinum, verbum a verbo,
quibus nunc utimur in scholis ad
instantiam sancti Thomae de
Aquino. Nam temporibus domini
Alberti translatione vetere omnes
communiter utebantur.” “Albert’s
day” was of course no different
from Aquinas’ whom he outlived
by six years.</p>

<p>In 1847 the <i>Histoire Littéraire</i>,
XXI, 147, said, “Guillaume de
Meerbeke passe pour avoir traduit
tous les livres d’Aristote, à la
prière de saint Thomas. Nous
n’oserions affirmer ni cette intervention
du docteur angélique, ni
cette immensité des travaux du
traducteur brabançon. Il s’en faut
qu’on ait de lui une série si
volumineuse de versions latines.”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_1979" href="#FNanchor_1979" class="label">[1979]</a> As has been pointed out by HL
XXI, 147, in the case of the “new
translation” of the Ethics, dated
in the colophon in 1282, whereas
Aquinas died in 1274. Quetif and
Echard (1719), I, 390, had argued,
however, that this date was when
the MS was copied and not when
the translation was made; but this
is far-fetched as most of William’s
translations are similarly
dated. Certainly William’s labors
as a translator did not cease with
his elevation to the archbishopric
of Corinth, since he translated
Galen <i>De alimentis</i> in 1277 and
works by Proclus in 1281.</p>

<p>Quetif and Echard, in order to
maintain the cooperation supposed
to exist between William and
Aquinas, also hold that William’s
translation of the <i>Elementatio
theologica</i> of Proclus made at
Viterbo in 1268 was from the
Arabic and not from the Greek,
since Aquinas says in his commentary
on that work that the
Greek text had not yet been
found. This conclusion is also
drawn by HL XXI, 148.</p>

third, if prohibited, when, and if
not always, why not; fourth,
whether to cast lots is to tempt
God; fifth, whether they were permissible
before Christ but not
since; sixth, why women are

men. The last question, which appears
to have been whether the
subjects of lot casting could be
evil, seems to be left unfinished.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2023" href="#FNanchor_2023" class="label">[2023]</a> As we have already been over
their arguments, Aquinas’ presentation
thereof may perhaps be better
summarized here than in the
text. The Gospel account led the
Priscillianists to subject all human
acts to fate and the Manicheans
to repudiate the Book of
Matthew as inculcating a belief
in fate. Against them are rehearsed
the following arguments.
First, as Augustine says (<i>Contra
Faustum</i>, II, 5), no astrologer
asserts that a star will leave its
usual position at a man’s birth
and go to him, as the Gospel narrative
asserts that the star in the
east did, and hence Matthew confounds
rather than defends the
error of astrology. Aquinas then
quotes with apparent approval
the erroneous assertion of Chrysostom
(<i>Homily 6 in Matth.</i>) that
“it is not astronomy’s task to
tell from the stars who are being
born, but to predict the future
from the hour of nativity.” He
also notes Chrysostom’s objection
that it took the Magi over two
years to travel to Bethlehem so
that the star must have appeared
two years before Christ’s birth.
This, by the way, would make the
date 4 B. C., usually given for the
birth of Christ, fit nicely into
Münter’s date of 6 B. C. for the
constellation which portended it.
Aquinas also repeats the argument
that the star was probably
a new creation of God.</p>

<p>But all these criticisms are
really quite beside the point,
since even according to the Bible
story, the Magi, who were evidently
astronomers, knew perfectly
well what the star meant.
Indeed, Aquinas himself repeats
the statement that the birth of
Christ was announced to them by
a star, although to Simon and
Anna and to the shepherds by
other methods, because they were
used to stars. If it was a very
unusual kind of star and had a
very unusual meaning, all that
simply goes to show that a good
astrologer is equal to any emergency.
Aquinas, indeed, or rather,
his authorities, sees the need of
stating some other method than
astrological skill by which the
Magi comprehended the significance
of the star. He adduces
two explanations from Augustine
(<i>Sermo 374 de Epiphania</i>, and
<i>De quaest. vet. et nov. test.,
Quaest. 63</i>); one that they were
admonished by angels, which
makes us wonder why there was
any star at all; the other, that
Balaam had left them a prediction
concerning the coming of the star.</p>

<p>Aquinas also repeats something
of what the fathers have said on
the allegorical significance of the
Magi. But on the whole he, like
his authorities, fails signally to
explain away the astrological significance
of the Magi.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_2028" href="#FNanchor_2028" class="label">[2028]</a> See the list of writings ascribed
to Albert in Borgnet’s edition
of his works, I, lxii. I have
also seen the treatise ascribed to
Albert in the Explicit of Sloane
2156, 15th century, fols. 154-9.</p>

<p>In Bologna University Library,
1158, 14th century, where the first
treatise in the MS at fols. 1-39
is the treatise of Aquinas against
William of St. Amour, our treatise
together with another <i>De fato</i>
which follows it and brief treatises
on divination and lots are
catalogued together as fols. 41-52,
“Magistri Alberti theotonici de
fato, de divinatione, de sortibus.”
In the MS itself, however, the
only statements as to authorship
are headings in the margin. That
at the beginning of our <i>De fato</i>
seems to be “Magri” (Magistri)
“Alrti” (or Alxri, rather than
Alberti) and a third word which
looks like “Theotonici.” The second
<i>De fato</i> is headed “Magri
(Magistri) Alexandri” in the upper
margin of fol. 45r, and the
next treatise is headed, fol. 47r,
“Questio de divinatione Alexandri.”
The anonymous <i>De sortibus</i>
which follows it is also not
Aquinas’. The second treatise on
fate considers six questions, of
which the last is whether Christ
was physically subject to the influence
of the constellations like
other men.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_2029" href="#FNanchor_2029" class="label">[2029]</a> In BN 16096, 13th century, fol.
138r-, is another which seems different
from either of the <i>De
fato’s</i> mentioned in the preceding
note. The catalogue questioningly
assigns it to Alexander, but
is probably misled by a rubric
at fol. 139v which seems to be
simply a citation (“in sic inscripto
libro”) and which reads, “Alexandri
affridisei ad imperatores antoninum
et severinum liber de
fato.” In this same MS at fols.
120v-122r occurs Aquinas’ <i>De occultis
operibus</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Our
method of
considering
him.</div>

<p>Contemporary with the three learned Dominicans of whom
preceding chapters have treated&mdash;Albert, Thomas, and Vincent&mdash;was
the Franciscan friar, Roger Bacon, who in modern
times has received so much attention and admiration at
the expense of his contemporaries and his age.<a id="FNanchor_2030" href="#Footnote_2030" class="fnanchor">[2030]</a> Happily in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_618">[Pg 618]</span>
the present volume we are in a better position to estimate
him fairly. The best, if not the only way to appreciate him
aright is by a detailed study of the writings and doctrines
of his predecessors and contemporaries. Roger Bacon has
hitherto been studied too much in isolation. He has been
regarded as an exceptional individual; his environment has
been estimated at his own valuation of it or according to
some preconceived idea of his age; and his writings have
not been studied in relation to those of his predecessors and
contemporaries. Thought of as a precursor of modern
science, he has been read to find germs of modern ideas
rather than scrutinized with a view to discovering his sources.
Yet his constant citing of authorities and the helpful footnotes
which Bridges, in his edition of the <i>Opus Maius</i>, gives
to explain these allusions to other scientists, point insistently
in the latter direction. When one has gone a step further
and has read for their own sake the works of men like Adelard
of Bath, William of Conches, and Daniel of Morley in
the twelfth century, or William of Auvergne, Robert Grosseteste
and Albert Magnus in the early and middle thirteenth
century, the true position of Roger Bacon in the history of
thought grows clearer. One then re-reads his works with a
new insight, finds that a different interpretation may be put
upon many a passage, and realizes that even in his most
boastful moments Roger himself never made such claims to
astounding originality as some modern writers have made
for him. Conversely, one is impelled to the conclusion that
Bacon’s writings, instead of being unpalatable to, neglected
by, and far in advance of, his times, give a most valuable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_619">[Pg 619]</span>
picture of medieval thought, summarizing, it is true, its most
advanced stages, but also including much that is most characteristic,
and even revealing some of its back currents. It
is from this standpoint that we shall consider Roger Bacon
and endeavor to refute misconceptions that have grown up
concerning his life and learning. We shall also, in conformity
with our main theme, take particular note of his experimental
science, long regarded as the brightest gem in his
crown, and of other aspects of his learning which have hitherto
not received special or proper treatment, namely, the
astrology and magic to which he gives so much space and
emphasis and which so seriously affect all his thought, but
which probably did not affect his life and the attitude of his
age towards him in the way that many have assumed.</p>

<h4>I. <i>Life</i></h4>

<div class="sidenote">Birth,
family,
and early
life.</div>

<p>Past estimates of Bacon’s learning have been greatly affected
by their holders’ views of his life; but his biography is
gradually being shorn of fictions and losing that sensational
and exceptional character which gave countenance to the representation
of his thought as far in advance of his age. We
cannot tell to which of several families of Bacons mentioned
in feudal registers and other documents of the times he belonged,
and the exact date and place of his birth are uncertain.<a id="FNanchor_2031" href="#Footnote_2031" class="fnanchor">[2031]</a>
But he speaks of England as his native land, and in
1267 looks back upon a past of some forty years of study
and twenty years of specialization in his favorite branches
of learning.<a id="FNanchor_2032" href="#Footnote_2032" class="fnanchor">[2032]</a> In another passage he mentions having spent
all his spare time for ten years upon the science of perspective.<a id="FNanchor_2033" href="#Footnote_2033" class="fnanchor">[2033]</a>
Also he speaks of one brother as rich, of another as
a student, and of his family’s suffering exile for their support
of Henry III against the barons.<a id="FNanchor_2034" href="#Footnote_2034" class="fnanchor">[2034]</a> He implies that up
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_620">[Pg 620]</span>
to 1267 he had not been outside France and England,<a id="FNanchor_2035" href="#Footnote_2035" class="fnanchor">[2035]</a> but he
had sent across the seas for material to assist his special investigations
and had spent large sums of money.<a id="FNanchor_2036" href="#Footnote_2036" class="fnanchor">[2036]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The years
before
1267.</div>

<p>Before he became a friar he had written text-books for
students, and had worked so hard that men wondered that
he still lived. When or why he joined the Franciscans we
are not informed,<a id="FNanchor_2037" href="#Footnote_2037" class="fnanchor">[2037]</a> but his doing so is no cause for wonder,
for both Orders were rich in learned men, including students
of natural science. Bacon tells us that after becoming a friar
he was able to study as much as before, but “did not work
so much,” probably because he now had less teaching to do.
For about ten years before 1267, instead of being imprisoned
and ill-treated by his order, as was once believed without
foundation, he was, as we now know from his own words
discovered in 1897, in poor health and “took no part in the
outward affairs of the university.” This abstention caused
the report to spread that he was devoting all his time to
writing, especially since many were aware that he had long
intended to sum up his knowledge in a <i>magnum opus</i>, but he
actually “composed nothing except a few chapters, now about
one science and now about another, compiled in odd moments
at the instance of friends.” At least this is what he
told the pope in 1267 when trying to excuse himself for having
had no completed work ready to submit to the supreme
pontiff.<a id="FNanchor_2038" href="#Footnote_2038" class="fnanchor">[2038]</a> During these years he seems to have fallen into
some obscurity, since in the <i>Opus Tertium</i> he compares his
tone in the <i>Opus Minus</i> to that of Cicero, when recalled from
exile, in the letter in which he humbled himself and congratulated
the Roman senate. So Bacon, describing himself
probably with some rhetorical exaggeration as an exile for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_621">[Pg 621]</span>
the past ten years from his former scholastic fame,<a id="FNanchor_2039" href="#Footnote_2039" class="fnanchor">[2039]</a> recognizes
his own littleness and admires the wisdom of the pope,
who has deigned to seek works of scholarship “from me,
now unheard by anyone and as it were buried in oblivion.”<a id="FNanchor_2040" href="#Footnote_2040" class="fnanchor">[2040]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Bacon
and the
mariner’s
compass.</div>

<p>R. H. Major’s <i>Prince Henry the Navigator</i> is responsible
for the spread of the story that in 1258 Brunetto Latini
saw Friar Bacon at the Parliament at Oxford and was shown
by him the secret of the magnetic needle, which Roger dared
not divulge for fear of being accused of magic. The supposed
letter of Brunetto Latini to the poet Guido Cavalcanti,
from which these data are drawn, seems to have been a hoax
or fanciful production appearing first in 1802 in the <i>Monthly
Magazine</i><a id="FNanchor_2041" href="#Footnote_2041" class="fnanchor">[2041]</a> among “Extracts from the Portfolio of a Man
of Letters,” who is said to have translated them from “the
French patois of the Romansch language.” Certainly the
mariner’s compass was pretty well known in Bacon’s time,
nor are we informed of any case where it involved its possessor
in a trial for magic. Bacon says in one passage that
if the experiment of the magnet with respect to iron “were
not known to the world, it would seem a great miracle.”<a id="FNanchor_2042" href="#Footnote_2042" class="fnanchor">[2042]</a>
In another place he grants that even the common herd of
philosophers know of the magnetic needle; he merely criticizes
their belief that the needle always turns towards the
north star; Roger thinks that it can be made to turn to any
other point of the compass if only it has been properly magnetized.<a id="FNanchor_2043" href="#Footnote_2043" class="fnanchor">[2043]</a>
Perhaps the Latini story was suggested by a third
passage, where Bacon says, in order to illustrate his statement
that philosophers have sometimes resorted to charms
and incantations to hide their secrets from the unworthy,
“As if, for instance, it were quite unknown that the magnetic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_622">[Pg 622]</span>
needle attracts iron and someone wishing to perform
this operation before the people should make characters and
utter incantations, so that they might not see that the operation
of attraction was entirely natural.”<a id="FNanchor_2044" href="#Footnote_2044" class="fnanchor">[2044]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
papal
mandate.</div>

<p>Bacon’s career centers about a papal mandate which was
despatched to him in the summer of 1266. Guy de Foulques,
who became Clement IV on February 5, 1265, had at some
previous time requested Bacon to send him the <i>scriptum
principale</i> or comprehensive work on philosophy which he
had been led to think was already written.<a id="FNanchor_2045" href="#Footnote_2045" class="fnanchor">[2045]</a> On June 22,
1266, he repeated this request in the form of a papal mandate,
which is extant.<a id="FNanchor_2046" href="#Footnote_2046" class="fnanchor">[2046]</a> The former letter is lost, but both
Bacon and the pope refer to it.<a id="FNanchor_2047" href="#Footnote_2047" class="fnanchor">[2047]</a> Somehow writers on Bacon
have paid little heed to this first request, have assumed that
Bacon wrote his three works to the pope in about a year<a id="FNanchor_2048" href="#Footnote_2048" class="fnanchor">[2048]</a>
despite the “impediments” upon which he dwells, and have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_623">[Pg 623]</span>
therefore been filled with admiration at the superhuman
genius which could produce such works at such short notice
while laboring under such difficulties.<a id="FNanchor_2049" href="#Footnote_2049" class="fnanchor">[2049]</a> But this is assuming
that Roger had done nothing in the considerable interval between
the two mandates. And why does he keep apologizing
for “so great delay in this matter,” and “Your Clemency’s
impatience at hope deferred.”<a id="FNanchor_2050" href="#Footnote_2050" class="fnanchor">[2050]</a> Moreover, his excuses do not
all apply to the same period, and most of them are excuses for
not having composed a full exposition of philosophy rather
than for not having composed sooner the <i>Opus Maius</i>, which
Roger regarded as a mere preamble to philosophy. One set
of excuses explains why he had no comprehensive work
ready when the first request arrived.<a id="FNanchor_2051" href="#Footnote_2051" class="fnanchor">[2051]</a> A second set explains
why he had not written it in the interval between the two
mandates.<a id="FNanchor_2052" href="#Footnote_2052" class="fnanchor">[2052]</a> A third set explains why he finally does not write
it at all but sends instead an introductory treatise, the <i>Opus
Maius</i>, supplemented by two others, the <i>Opus Minus</i> and
<i>Opus Tertium</i>. Of course some excuses hold equally good
for all three periods. But he states in the third treatise that
in writing the second he was free from some of the “impediments”
which had hampered his composition of the <i>Opus
Maius</i>.<a id="FNanchor_2053" href="#Footnote_2053" class="fnanchor">[2053]</a> As he also says that one reason for writing the
<i>Opus Minus</i> was lest the <i>Opus Maius</i> be lost amid the great
dangers of the roads at that time, one infers that the latter
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_624">[Pg 624]</span>
work was despatched before the other. Moreover, the <i>Opus
Minus</i> opens with a eulogy of the pope which is absent in
the <i>Opus Maius</i>,<a id="FNanchor_2054" href="#Footnote_2054" class="fnanchor">[2054]</a> in which there are very few passages to
suggest that it is addressed to the pope, or written later than
1266.<a id="FNanchor_2055" href="#Footnote_2055" class="fnanchor">[2055]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The composition
of
the three
works.</div>

<p>The <i>Opus Maius</i>, therefore, was practically finished, if
not already sent, when the papal mandate of 1266 reached
Bacon. When Roger learned that Foulques as pope was
still interested in his work, visions of what the apostolic see
might do for his programme of learning and himself flashed
before his mind, and, after a fresh but vain effort at a <i>scriptum
principale</i>, which kept him busy until Epiphany, he composed
the supplementary treatise, the <i>Opus Minus</i>, with its
adulatory introduction to Clement IV, with its excuses for
sending or having sent a preambulatory treatise instead of a
complete work of philosophy, with its hints that such a final
treatise can be successfully completed only with the financial
backing of the unlimited papal resources, with its analysis of
the preceding work for the benefit of the busy pope and its
suggestions as to what portions of it he might profitably
omit, and with its additions of matter which in the <i>Opus
Maius</i> Roger had either forgotten or at that time had not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_625">[Pg 625]</span>
been in a position to insert. The third work, <i>Opus Tertium</i>,
is of the same sort but apparently more disorderly in arrangement,
and looser and more extravagant in its tone.
Presumably it was undertaken to remind the pope again of
Bacon’s existence and proposals; it is even conceivable that
Roger was a little unstrung when he composed it; it has been
suggested that it was left unfinished and never sent to the
pope, who died in 1268. A part at least of the <i>Opus Tertium</i>
was written in 1267.<a id="FNanchor_2056" href="#Footnote_2056" class="fnanchor">[2056]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The injunction
of secrecy.</div>

<p>The extant papal mandate orders Bacon not only to send
his book but to state “what remedies you think should be
applied in those matters which you recently intimated were
of so great importance,” and to “do this without delay as
secretly as you can.”<a id="FNanchor_2057" href="#Footnote_2057" class="fnanchor">[2057]</a> This allusion to matters of importance
and this injunction of secrecy have cast a certain veil of
mystery over the three works and the relations of Roger and
the pope. Observance of secrecy may have been intended to
guard against such frauds of copyists as we shall soon hear
Bacon describe, or to secure some alchemistic arcana or practical
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_626">[Pg 626]</span>
inventions which the pope had been led to expect from
him. Indeed, so far as alchemy was concerned, Bacon observed
the injunction of secrecy so strictly that he divided his
discussion of the subject among four different treatises sent
to the pope at different times and by different messengers, so
that no outsider might steal the precious truth. It must be
added that even after receiving all four instalments, the pope
would not have been much nearer the philosopher’s stone
than before.<a id="FNanchor_2058" href="#Footnote_2058" class="fnanchor">[2058]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Roger
Bacon
and the
Franciscans.</div>

<p>Another moot question in Bacon’s biography besides that
of the composition of the three works is that of his relations
with the Franciscan Order. We have seen that it was natural
for him to join it, and that the change, at first at least, seemed
one for the better. Bacon, however, found irksome the rule
made by the order in 1260, as a consequence of the publication
in 1254 of Gerard’s heretical <i>Introductorius in Evangelium
Aeternum</i>, that in the future no Franciscan should publish
anything without permission.<a id="FNanchor_2059" href="#Footnote_2059" class="fnanchor">[2059]</a> Roger wished to employ
amanuenses even in composing his works, and these men, he
tells the pope, would often divulge “the most secret writings,”<a id="FNanchor_2060" href="#Footnote_2060" class="fnanchor">[2060]</a>
and so involve one in unintentional violation of the
above rule. “And therefore,” says Bacon, “I did not feel
the least bit like writing anything.”<a id="FNanchor_2061" href="#Footnote_2061" class="fnanchor">[2061]</a> For a man so easily
discouraged one cannot feel much sympathy. There is however
another important inference from his statement: instead
of his writings being neglected by his age, they are so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_627">[Pg 627]</span>
valued that they are pirated before they have been published.
Moreover, this rule of his order should not have hampered
Bacon much in writing for the pope; indeed, Roger himself
implies that he was exempted from this restriction in the
earlier request from the cardinal as well as in the later papal
mandate. Raymond of Laon, Bacon grants, had correctly
informed “Your Magnificence, as both the mandates state,”
concerning this regulation, though he had given a wrong impression
as to what Bacon already had written.<a id="FNanchor_2062" href="#Footnote_2062" class="fnanchor">[2062]</a></p>

<p>We have heard from Bacon’s own mouth that he did little
public teaching after becoming a friar, that he had as
much time for private study as ever, and that everybody supposed
him to be at work at his <i>magnum opus</i>. Yet in the
<i>Opus Minus</i> he grumbles that “his prelates were at him every
day to do other things”<a id="FNanchor_2063" href="#Footnote_2063" class="fnanchor">[2063]</a> before he received the first mandate
from the cardinal, and that even thereafter he was unable to
excuse himself fully from their demands upon his time, “because
Your Lordship had ordered me to treat that business
secretly, nor had Your Glory given them any instructions.”<a id="FNanchor_2064" href="#Footnote_2064" class="fnanchor">[2064]</a>
In the <i>Opus Tertium</i> he describes the same situation in
stronger language: “They pressed me with unspeakable violence
to obey their will as others did,” and “I sustained so
many and so great setbacks that I cannot tell them.”<a id="FNanchor_2065" href="#Footnote_2065" class="fnanchor">[2065]</a> On
how we interpret a few such passages as these depends our
estimate of the attitude of the Franciscan Order before 1267
to Bacon and his ideas and researches. He gives so many
other reasons why he has no comprehensive work of philosophy
ready for the pope that this attitude of his superiors
seems a relatively slight factor. He needed much money, he
needed expensive instruments, he needed a large library, he
needed “plenty of parchment,” he needed a corps of assistant
investigators and another of copyists with skilled superintendents
to direct their efforts and insert figures and other
delicate details. It was a task beyond the powers of any one
man; besides, he was in ill-health, he felt languid, he composed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_628">[Pg 628]</span>
very slowly. Shall we blame his superiors for not
providing him with this expensive equipment; and are we
surprised, when we remember that the mandates directed
him to send a book supposed to be already finished, that
his superiors continued to ask of him the performance of
his usual duties as a friar? Their attitude can scarcely be
regarded as persecution of Bacon or hostility to his science.
On the other hand, Clement IV must be given credit for his
effort to elicit from Bacon a <i>scriptum principale</i>; and it may
well be doubted if Roger would have produced anything
equivalent to the <i>Opus Maius</i>, <i>Opus Minus</i> and <i>Opus Tertium</i>
without this papal encouragement.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bacon’s
life after
1267.</div>

<p>In 1272 in the <i>Compendium Studii Philosophiae</i> Bacon
lays bare the failings of “the two orders” as if he belonged
to neither, but he then proceeds to refute indignantly those
masters at Paris who have tried to argue that the state of
the higher secular clergy, such as bishops, is more perfect
than that of the religious.<a id="FNanchor_2066" href="#Footnote_2066" class="fnanchor">[2066]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">His
reported
condemnation.</div>

<p>In 1277, however, we learn “solely on the very contestable
authority of the Chronicle of the XXIV Generals,”<a id="FNanchor_2067" href="#Footnote_2067" class="fnanchor">[2067]</a> a
work written about 1370, although containing earlier matter,<a id="FNanchor_2068" href="#Footnote_2068" class="fnanchor">[2068]</a>
that at the suggestion of many friars the teaching of
“Friar Roger Bacon of England, master of sacred theology,”
was condemned as containing “some suspected novelties,”
that Roger was sentenced to prison, and that the pope was
asked to help to suppress the dangerous doctrines in question.
It has been a favorite conjecture of students of Bacon that
he incurred this condemnation by his leanings toward astrology
and magic; but, as we shall see later, his views on
these subjects were not novelties. He shared them with
Albertus Magnus and other contemporaries, and there seems
no good reason why they should have got him into trouble.
Suffice it here to note that the wording of the chronicle suggests
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_629">[Pg 629]</span>
nothing of the sort, but rather some details of doctrine,
whereas had Bacon been charged with magic, we may be
pretty sure that so sensational a feature would not have
passed unmentioned.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Franciscans
and
science:
John
Peckham.</div>

<p>How absurd it is to think that the Franciscan Order
was opposed to Bacon’s pursuit of natural and experimental
science, or that he was alone among the members of that
order in the pursuit of such subjects, may be inferred from
a glance at the career of John Peckham who from 1279 to
his death in 1292 was archbishop of Canterbury.<a id="FNanchor_2069" href="#Footnote_2069" class="fnanchor">[2069]</a> According
to a letter of Bacon’s favorite, Adam Marsh, Peckham
entered the Franciscan Order about 1250. He had been
educated in France but about 1270 became lector of his
order at Oxford. He also became the ninth provincial minister
of the Franciscans in England, and had been called to
Rome by the pope to be <i>Lector sacri palatii</i> before his nomination
by the pope to the archbishopric of Canterbury. Yet
this Franciscan who rose so high in the church was the
author of a treatise on Perspective, one of the five subjects
which Bacon held could be of such service to the church and
yet were being so woefully neglected. In his <i>Perspectiva
communis</i>, which was printed at Venice in 1504, Peckham
talks of such matters as the reflection of visible rays and
experiment. A work on the sphere and a <i>Theory of the
Planets</i> which exists only in manuscript are also attributed
to him. It has even been suggested that he was the bright
lad John whom Bacon sent to explain his work to the pope,
but Peckham was evidently too old in 1267 to fill that rôle.
Bartholomew of England was another Franciscan interested,
as we have seen, both in natural science and astrology, and
other Friar Preachers than Albertus Magnus and Aquinas
showed the same interest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Was
Bacon still
writing
in 1292?</div>

<p>This is about all that we know of Bacon’s life except the
dates of one or two more of his works. Mr. Little regards
it as “certain that Roger’s last dated work was written in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_630">[Pg 630]</span>
1292.”<a id="FNanchor_2070" href="#Footnote_2070" class="fnanchor">[2070]</a> This was his treatise on the study of theology,
which in one passage gives the year as 1292 and in another
speaks of “forty years and more” as having elapsed since
1250.<a id="FNanchor_2071" href="#Footnote_2071" class="fnanchor">[2071]</a> It is rather surprising to find his literary activity
continuing so late, since in 1267 he wrote as if well along
in life.</p>

<h4 id="CRITICISM">II. <i>His Criticism of and Part in Medieval Learning</i></h4>

<div class="sidenote">Aims and
plan of
the <i>Opus
Maius</i>.</div>

<p>We turn from Bacon’s life to his writings, and shall
center our attention upon his three works to the pope. In
them he had his greatest opportunity and did his best work
both in style and substance. They embody most of his ideas
and knowledge. Much, for example, of the celebrated
“Epistle concerning the secret works of art and nature and
the nullity of magic” sounds like a later compilation from
these three works.<a id="FNanchor_2072" href="#Footnote_2072" class="fnanchor">[2072]</a> Two of them are merely supplementary
to the <i>Opus Maius</i> and are parallel to it in aims, plan,
and contents. Its two chief aims were to demonstrate the
practical utility of “philosophy,” especially to the Church,
and secondly, to reform the present state of learning according
to Bacon’s idea of the relative importance of the sciences.
Having convinced himself that an exhaustive work on
philosophy was not yet possible, Roger substituted this introductory
treatise, outlining the paths along which future
study and investigation should go. Of the thirty divisions
of philosophy he considers only the five which he deems the
most important and essential, namely, the languages, “mathematics,”
perspective or optic, “experimental science” (including
alchemy), and moral philosophy, which last he regards
as “the noblest” and “the mistress of them all.”<a id="FNanchor_2073" href="#Footnote_2073" class="fnanchor">[2073]</a>
Treated in this order, these “sciences” form the themes of
the last five of the seven sections of the <i>Opus Maius</i>. Inasmuch
as Roger regarded himself as a reformer of the
state of learning, he prefixed a first part on the causes of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_631">[Pg 631]</span>
human error to justify his divergence from the views of
the multitude. His second section develops his ideas as to
the relations of “philosophy” and theology.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bacon’s
theological
standpoint.</div>

<p>The mere plan of the <i>Opus Maius</i> thus indicates that
it is not exclusively devoted to natural science. “Divine
wisdom,” or theology, is the end that all human thought
should serve, and morality is the supreme science. Children
should receive more education in the Bible and the
fundamentals of Christianity, and spend less time upon
“the fables and insanities” of Ovid and other poets who
are full of errors in faith and morals.<a id="FNanchor_2074" href="#Footnote_2074" class="fnanchor">[2074]</a> In discussing other
sciences Bacon’s eye is ever fixed upon their utility “to the
Church of God, to the republic of the faithful, toward the
conversion of infidels and the conquest of such as cannot
be converted.”<a id="FNanchor_2075" href="#Footnote_2075" class="fnanchor">[2075]</a> This service is to be rendered not merely
by practical inventions or calendar reform or revision of
the Vulgate, but by aiding in most elaborate and far-fetched
allegorical interpretation of the Bible. To give a very simple
example of this, it is not enough for the interpreter of
Scripture to know that the lion is the king of beasts; he
must be so thoroughly acquainted with all the lion’s natural
properties that he can tell whether in any particular passage
it is meant to typify Christ or the devil.<a id="FNanchor_2076" href="#Footnote_2076" class="fnanchor">[2076]</a> Also the marvels
of human science strengthen our faith in divine miracles.<a id="FNanchor_2077" href="#Footnote_2077" class="fnanchor">[2077]</a>
Bacon speaks of philosophy as the handmaid of “sacred
wisdom”;<a id="FNanchor_2078" href="#Footnote_2078" class="fnanchor">[2078]</a> he asserts that all truth is contained in Scripture,
though philosophy and canon law are required for its comprehension
and exposition, and that anything alien therefrom
is utterly erroneous.<a id="FNanchor_2079" href="#Footnote_2079" class="fnanchor">[2079]</a> Nay more, the Bible is surer
ground than philosophy even in the latter’s own field of the
natures and properties of things.<a id="FNanchor_2080" href="#Footnote_2080" class="fnanchor">[2080]</a> Furthermore, “philosophy
considered by itself is of no utility.”<a id="FNanchor_2081" href="#Footnote_2081" class="fnanchor">[2081]</a> Bacon believed
not only that the active intellect (<i>intellectus agens</i>) by which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_632">[Pg 632]</span>
our minds are illuminated was from God and not an integral
part of the human mind,<a id="FNanchor_2082" href="#Footnote_2082" class="fnanchor">[2082]</a> but that all philosophy had been
revealed by God to the sainted patriarchs and again to Solomon,<a id="FNanchor_2083" href="#Footnote_2083" class="fnanchor">[2083]</a>
and that it was impossible for man by his own efforts
to attain to “the great truths of the arts and sciences.”<a id="FNanchor_2084" href="#Footnote_2084" class="fnanchor">[2084]</a>
Bacon alludes several times to sin as an obstacle to the
acquisition of science;<a id="FNanchor_2085" href="#Footnote_2085" class="fnanchor">[2085]</a> on the other hand, he observes that
contemporary Christians are inferior morally to the pagan
philosophers, from whose books they might well take a
leaf.<a id="FNanchor_2086" href="#Footnote_2086" class="fnanchor">[2086]</a> All this gives little evidence of an independent scientific
spirit, or of appreciation of experimental method as
the one sure foundation of scientific knowledge. We see
how much of a medieval friar and theologian and how little
of a modern scientist Roger could be. It must, of course,
be remembered that he is trying to persuade the Church to
support scientific research; still, there seems to be no sufficient
reason for doubting his sincerity in the above statements,
though we must discount here as elsewhere his tendency
to make emphatic and sweeping assertions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
Bacon’s
scholastic
side.</div>

<p>Writers as far back as Cousin<a id="FNanchor_2087" href="#Footnote_2087" class="fnanchor">[2087]</a> and Charles have recognized
that Bacon was interested in the scholasticism of his
time as well as in natural science. His separate works on
the Metaphysics and Physics of Aristotle are pretty much
the usual sort of medieval commentary;<a id="FNanchor_2088" href="#Footnote_2088" class="fnanchor">[2088]</a> the tiresome dialectic
of the <i>Questions on Aristotle’s Physics</i> is well
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_633">[Pg 633]</span>
brought out in Duhem’s essay, “Roger Bacon et l’Horreur
du Vide.”<a id="FNanchor_2089" href="#Footnote_2089" class="fnanchor">[2089]</a> Bacon’s works dedicated to the pope, on the
contrary, are written to a considerable extent in a clear,
direct, outspoken style; and the subjects of linguistics, mathematics,
and experimental science seem at first glance to offer
little opportunity for metaphysical disquisitions or scholastic
method. Yet, here too, much space is devoted to intellectual
battledore and shuttlecock with such concepts as
matter and form, moved and mover, agent and patient, element
and compound.<a id="FNanchor_2090" href="#Footnote_2090" class="fnanchor">[2090]</a> Such current problems as the unity
of the intellect, the source of the <i>intellectus agens</i>, and the
unity or infinity of matter are introduced for discussion,<a id="FNanchor_2091" href="#Footnote_2091" class="fnanchor">[2091]</a>
although the question of universals is briefly dismissed.<a id="FNanchor_2092" href="#Footnote_2092" class="fnanchor">[2092]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Attitude
to Aristotle
and
other authorities.</div>

<p>Two other characteristic traits of scholasticism are found
in the <i>Opus Maius</i>, namely, continual use of authorities and
the highest regard for Aristotle, <i>summus philosophorum</i>,<a id="FNanchor_2093" href="#Footnote_2093" class="fnanchor">[2093]</a>
as Bacon calls him. Because in one passage in his <i>Compendium
Studii Philosophiae</i> Bacon says in his exaggerated
way that he would burn all the Latin translations of Aristotle
if he could,<a id="FNanchor_2094" href="#Footnote_2094" class="fnanchor">[2094]</a> it has sometimes been assumed that he
was opposed to the medieval study of Aristotle. Yet in the
very next sentence he declares that “Aristotle’s labors are
the foundations of all wisdom.” What he wanted was more,
not less Aristotle. He believed that Aristotle had written a
thousand works.<a id="FNanchor_2095" href="#Footnote_2095" class="fnanchor">[2095]</a> He complains quite as much that certain
works of Aristotle have not yet been translated into Latin
as he does that others have been translated incorrectly. As
a matter of fact, he himself seems to have made about as
many mistakes in connection with the study of Aristotle as
did anyone else. He thought many apocryphal writings
genuine, such as the <i>Secret of Secrets</i>,<a id="FNanchor_2096" href="#Footnote_2096" class="fnanchor">[2096]</a> an astrological treatise
entitled <i>De Impressionibus Coelestibus</i>,<a id="FNanchor_2097" href="#Footnote_2097" class="fnanchor">[2097]</a> and other writings
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_634">[Pg 634]</span>
concerning “the arcana of science” and “marvels of
nature.”<a id="FNanchor_2098" href="#Footnote_2098" class="fnanchor">[2098]</a> He overestimated Aristotle and blamed the translators
for obscurities and difficulties which abound in the
Greek text itself. He declares that a few chapters of Aristotle’s
Laws are superior to the entire <i>corpus</i> of Roman
law.<a id="FNanchor_2099" href="#Footnote_2099" class="fnanchor">[2099]</a> His assertion that Robert Grosseteste paid no attention
to translations of Aristotle is regarded as misleading
by Baur.<a id="FNanchor_2100" href="#Footnote_2100" class="fnanchor">[2100]</a> He nowhere gives credit to Albertus Magnus
and Thomas Aquinas for their great commentaries on Aristotle<a id="FNanchor_2101" href="#Footnote_2101" class="fnanchor">[2101]</a>
which are superior to any that he wrote. He bases
some of his own views upon mistranslations of Aristotle,
substituting, for instance, “matter” for “substance”&mdash;a mistranslation
avoided by Albert and Thomas.<a id="FNanchor_2102" href="#Footnote_2102" class="fnanchor">[2102]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Bacon’s
critical
bent.</div>

<p>Despite its theological and scholastic proclivities, Bacon’s
mind had a decidedly critical bent. He was, like Petrarch,
profoundly pessimistic as to his own times. Church music,
present-day sermons, the immorality of monks and theologians,
the misconduct of students at Oxford and Paris,
the wars and exactions of kings and feudal lords, the prevalence
of Roman Law&mdash;these are some of the faults he has
to find with his age.<a id="FNanchor_2103" href="#Footnote_2103" class="fnanchor">[2103]</a> The <i>Opus Maius</i> is largely devoted,
not to objective presentation of facts and discussion of
theories, but to subjective criticism of the state of learning
and even of individual contemporary scholars. This last is
so unusual that Bacon excuses himself for it to the pope
in both the supplementary treatises.<a id="FNanchor_2104" href="#Footnote_2104" class="fnanchor">[2104]</a> Several other works
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_635">[Pg 635]</span>
of Bacon display the same critical tendency. The <i>Compendium
Studii Philosophiae</i> enlarges upon the complaints
and criticisms of the three works. In the <i>Tractatus de
Erroribus Medicorum</i> he detected in contemporary medicine
“thirty-six great and radical defects with infinite ramifications.”<a id="FNanchor_2105" href="#Footnote_2105" class="fnanchor">[2105]</a>
But in medicine, too, his own contributions
are of little account. In the <i>Compendium Studii Theologiae</i>,
after contemptuous allusion to the huge <i>Summae</i> of
the past fifty years, he opens with an examination of the
problems of speculative philosophy which underlie the questions
discussed by contemporary theologians. As far as we
know that is as far as he got. And in the five neglected sciences
to which his <i>Opus Maius</i> was a mere introduction he
seems to have made little further progress than is there
recorded; it has yet to be proved that he made any definite
original contribution to any particular science.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Criticism
easier
than construction.</div>

<p>After all, we must keep in mind the fact that in ancient
and medieval times hostile criticism was more likely to hit
the mark than were attempts at constructive thought and
collection of scientific details. There were plenty of wrong
ideas to knock down; it was not easy to find a rock foundation
to build upon, or materials without some hidden flaw.
The church fathers made many telling shots in their bombardment
of pagan thought; their own interpretation of
nature and life less commands our admiration. So Roger
Bacon, by devoting much of his space to criticism of the
mistakes of others and writing “preambles” to science and
theology, avoided treacherous detail&mdash;a wise caution for his
times. Thus he constructed a sort of intellectual portico
more pretentious than he could have justified by his main
building. To a superficial observer this portico may seem
a fitting entrance to the temple of modern science, but a
closer examination discovers that it is built of the same
faulty materials as the neglected ruins of his contemporaries’
science.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_636">[Pg 636]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Commonplaces
of
medieval
criticism.</div>

<p>Merely to have assumed a critical point of view in the
middle ages may seem a distinction; but Abelard, Adelard
of Bath, William of Conches, and Daniel Morley were all
critical, back in the twelfth century. Moreover, our estimate
of any critic must take into account how valid, how
accurate, how original and how consistent his criticisms
were and from what motives they proceeded. Some of
Bacon’s complaints the reader of medieval literature has
often listened to before. What student of philosophy in the
twelfth and thirteenth centuries had not sighed at the invasion
of the Roman law into school and church and state?
What devotee of astronomy had failed to contrast its human
interest and divine relationships with the dry drubbing of
the jurists? What learned man had not expressed his preference
for the wise and the experts (<i>sapientes</i>) over the
<i>vulgus</i> or common herd? The great secrets of learning
and the danger of casting pearls before swine were also
quite familiar concepts. If Bacon goes a step farther and
speaks of a <i>vulgus studentium</i> and even of a <i>vulgus medicorum</i>,
he is only refining a medical commonplace or quoting
Galen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Debt of
Bacon to
earlier
writers.</div>

<p>In Bacon’s discussion of the four causes of human error
his attack upon undue reliance on authority has often seemed
to modern readers most unusual for his age. But all his
arguments against authority are drawn from authorities;<a id="FNanchor_2106" href="#Footnote_2106" class="fnanchor">[2106]</a>
and while he seems to have got a whiff of the spirit of
rationalism from such classical writers as Seneca and Cicero,
he also quotes the <i>Natural Questions</i> of his fellow-countryman,
Adelard of Bath, who in the early twelfth century had
found the doctrine of the schools of Gaul as little to his
liking as was that of Paris to Roger’s taste, and whom we
have heard reprove his nephew for blind trust in authorities.<a id="FNanchor_2107" href="#Footnote_2107" class="fnanchor">[2107]</a>
Bacon’s fourth cause of human error, the concealment
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_637">[Pg 637]</span>
of ignorance by a false show of learning, might well
have been suggested by Daniel Morley’s satire on the
<i>bestiales</i> who occupied chairs in the schools of Paris “with
grave authority,” and reverently marked their Ulpians with
daggers and asterisks, and seemed wise as long as they
concealed their ignorance by a statuesque silence, but whom
he found “most childish” when they tried to say anything.
Or by the same Daniel’s warning not to spurn Arabic clarity
for Latin obscurity; and his charge that it was owing to
their ignorance and inability to attain definite conclusions
that Latin philosophers of his day spun so many elaborate
figments and hid “uncertain error under the shadow of
ambiguity.”<a id="FNanchor_2108" href="#Footnote_2108" class="fnanchor">[2108]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Limitations
of
his criticism.</div>

<p>Bacon’s criticisms have usually been taken to apply to
medieval learning as a whole, but a closer examination shows
their application to be much more limited. In the first place,
he is thinking only of the past “forty years” in making his
complaints; in the good old days of Grosseteste, Adam
Marsh, William Wolf, and William of Shyrwood things
were different, and scholarship flowed smoothly, if not
copiously, in the channels marked out by the ancient sages;<a id="FNanchor_2109" href="#Footnote_2109" class="fnanchor">[2109]</a>
nor does Bacon deny that there was a renaissance of natural
science and an independent scientific spirit still farther
back in the twelfth century.</p>

<p>Secondly, except for his tirades against the Italians and
their civil law, Bacon’s criticisms apply to but two countries,
France and England, and two universities, Oxford and
Paris. Also those few contemporaries whom he praises are
either his old Oxford friends or scattered individuals in
France. Of the state of learning in Italy, Spain, and Germany
he says little and apparently knew little. Amid his
sighing for some prince or prelate to play the patron to
science, he never mentions Alfonso X of Castile, who was
so interested in the “mathematics” and occult science which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_638">[Pg 638]</span>
were so dear to Bacon’s heart;<a id="FNanchor_2110" href="#Footnote_2110" class="fnanchor">[2110]</a> Roger even still employs
the old Toletan astronomical tables of Arzachel instead of
the Alfonsine tables issued in 1252, the first year of that
monarch’s reign.<a id="FNanchor_2111" href="#Footnote_2111" class="fnanchor">[2111]</a> His lamentation over the sad neglect of
astrology among the “Latins” is not borne out by our investigations
of their interest in that subject, and indicates
that he was ignorant of the work at the University of
Bologna of the astrologer, Guido Bonatti, whose voluminous
Latin treatise on that art based on wide reading in both
classical and Arabian scholars did not indeed appear until
after 1277,<a id="FNanchor_2112" href="#Footnote_2112" class="fnanchor">[2112]</a> but must have already been in preparation when
Bacon wrote, since Guido was born at some time before
1223.<a id="FNanchor_2113" href="#Footnote_2113" class="fnanchor">[2113]</a> Bacon grieves at the neglect of the science of optic
by his age, and says that it has not yet been lectured on at
Paris nor elsewhere among the Latins except twice at
Oxford;<a id="FNanchor_2114" href="#Footnote_2114" class="fnanchor">[2114]</a> he does not mention the Pole, Witelo, who
traveled in Italy and whose important treatise on the subject
was produced at about this time.<a id="FNanchor_2115" href="#Footnote_2115" class="fnanchor">[2115]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Roger
Bacon and
Albertus
Magnus.</div>

<p>While complaining of the ignorance of the natures and
properties of animals, plants, and minerals which is shown
by contemporary theologians in their explanation of Scriptural
passages, Bacon not only slights the encyclopedias
which several clergymen like Alexander Neckam, Bartholomew
of England, Thomas of Cantimpré and Vincent of
Beauvais had compiled; he also says nothing of the school
at Cologne of Albertus Magnus, whose reputation was already
established by the middle of the century, who personally
investigated many animals, especially those of the
north, and often rectified the erroneous assertions of classical
zoologists, whom the historian of botany has lauded, whose
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_639">[Pg 639]</span>
students too were curious to know not only the theoretical
botany that passed under the name of Aristotle, but also the
particular characteristics of plants, and who in his five books
on minerals discusses the alchemy and indulges in the same
occult science and astrology which Bacon deemed so important.
Yet Albert was a noted theologian and Biblical commentator
as well as a student of nature.</p>

<p>In saying that Bacon does not mention Albert’s work
in natural science, I of course do not mean to imply that
he never mentions Albert. He excuses his delay in answering
the pope by declaring that the most noted Christian
scholars, such as Brother Albert of the Order of Preachers,
and Master William of Shyrwood, could not in ten years
produce such a work as he transmits; and he incidentally
observes that William is a far abler scholar than Albert.<a id="FNanchor_2116" href="#Footnote_2116" class="fnanchor">[2116]</a>
I am suspicious, however, of the integrity of the passage<a id="FNanchor_2117" href="#Footnote_2117" class="fnanchor">[2117]</a>
where Bacon sneers at the theological teaching of “the boys
of the two Orders, such as Albert and Thomas and the
others who enter the Orders when twenty years or under.”
It seems incongruous for Bacon to speak of his probable
senior, Albert, as a boy. Other passages in Bacon’s works
which have been taken to apply to Albert, though he is not
expressly named, seem to me not to apply to him at all
closely; and if meant for him, they show that Bacon was
an incompetent and unfair critic. Not only was Albert only
for a short time in Paris; he does not seem to have been in
sympathy with the conditions there which Bacon attacks.
Nor can I see that Bacon is meant in the passage at the
close of Albert’s <i>Politics</i>,<a id="FNanchor_2118" href="#Footnote_2118" class="fnanchor">[2118]</a> where he declares that its doctrines,
as in his books on physics, are not his own theories
but a faithful reflection of peripatetic opinion; and that he
makes this statement for the benefit of lazy persons who
occupy their idle hours in searching writings for things to
criticize; “Such men killed Socrates, drove Plato from
Athens to the Academy, and, plotting even against Aristotle,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_640">[Pg 640]</span>
forced him into exile.” Such a passage seems a commonplace
one. Both Adelard of Bath and William of Conches
expressed the same fear of setting forth new ideas of their
own, and medieval writers not infrequently in their prefaces
apprehend with shrinking “the bite of envy” which both their
Horace and personal experience had taught would follow
fast on publication.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bacon’s
criticism
of education
applies
chiefly to
the training
of the
friars in
theology.</div>

<p>Thirdly, while Bacon occasionally makes bitter remarks
about the present state of learning in general, it is the teaching
of theology at Paris and by the friars that he has most
in mind and that he especially desires to reform. Though
himself a friar and master of theology, he had been trained
and had then himself specialized in the three learned languages,
Hebrew, Greek and Arabic, in optic and geometry,
in astronomy and astrology, in alchemy and “experimental
science,” and in the writings of the classical moralists.
Consequently he thought that no one could be a thorough
theologian who did not go through the same course of training;
nay, it was enough to ruin the reputation of any supposed
scholar in Bacon’s sight, if he were unacquainted with
these indispensable subjects. Bacon held that it was not
sufficient preparation for theology merely to study “the
common sciences, such as Latin, grammar, logic, and a part
of natural philosophy, and a little metaphysics.”<a id="FNanchor_2119" href="#Footnote_2119" class="fnanchor">[2119]</a> However,
it was not that he objected to these studies in themselves,
nor to the ordinary university instruction in the arts
course; in fact, he complains that many young friars start
in to study theology at once and “presume to investigate
philosophy by themselves without a teacher.”<a id="FNanchor_2120" href="#Footnote_2120" class="fnanchor">[2120]</a> Bacon has
a low opinion of the scholarship of Alexander of Hales,
because his university education had been completed before
the chief authorities and commentaries in natural philosophy
and metaphysics had been translated. Against another friar
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_641">[Pg 641]</span>
generally regarded by the academic world as its greatest
living authority Bacon brings the charge that “he never
heard philosophy in the schools,” and “was not instructed
nor trained in listening, reading and disputing, so that he
must be ignorant of the common sciences.”<a id="FNanchor_2121" href="#Footnote_2121" class="fnanchor">[2121]</a> Such passages
show that to represent Bacon’s writings as full of “sweeping
attacks” upon “the metaphysical subtleties and verbal
strifes” of his age is to exaggerate his position.<a id="FNanchor_2122" href="#Footnote_2122" class="fnanchor">[2122]</a> There
are not many direct attacks upon scholastic method in his
works.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His other
criticisms
of contemporary
education.</div>

<p>It is true that Bacon complains of the lack of good
teachers in his day, saying in the <i>Opus Minus</i> that he could
impart to an apt pupil in four years all the knowledge that
it had taken himself forty years to acquire,<a id="FNanchor_2123" href="#Footnote_2123" class="fnanchor">[2123]</a> and in the <i>Opus
Tertium</i> that he could do it in a half or a quarter of a year,
and that he could teach a good student all the Greek and
Hebrew he need know in three days for each subject.<a id="FNanchor_2124" href="#Footnote_2124" class="fnanchor">[2124]</a> But
aside from the young friars who presume to teach theology,
the teachers against whom he rails most are those in his
favorite subject of “mathematics.” Bacon could teach more
useful geometry in a fortnight than they do in ten or twenty
years<a id="FNanchor_2125" href="#Footnote_2125" class="fnanchor">[2125]</a>&mdash;a hint that much time was given in those days to
the study of mathematics. These boasts are not, however,
as wild as they may at first seem; after all Roger did not
know a vast amount of geometry and Greek and Hebrew,
and he had no intention of teaching any more of mathematics
and the languages than would be of service in his
other sciences, in theology, and in practical life. He complained
that “the ordinary mathematician does not consider
that he knows anything unless he demonstrates it, and so
he takes from thirty to forty years” to master the subject,
and that “the text-books and the teachers of mathematics
delight in multiplying conclusions to such an extent that
one has to give years of unnecessary time to extracting the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_642">[Pg 642]</span>
essentials,” and “this is one reason why there are so few
students of a science which is a prerequisite to all knowledge.”<a id="FNanchor_2126" href="#Footnote_2126" class="fnanchor">[2126]</a>
Nor were such boasts unique in the age in which
Bacon lived. Another professor and Franciscan friar, who
wrote at least no later than the early fourteenth century,
Bernard of Verdun, states that his little book on astronomy
takes the place of “innumerable works and huge tomes,” and
makes it possible for anyone acquainted with geometry to
learn in a short time not only the gist of books which two
years of steady reading could scarce suffice to cover, but
also many points which other books omit.<a id="FNanchor_2127" href="#Footnote_2127" class="fnanchor">[2127]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">His
personal
motives.</div>

<p>It is easy to discern the personal motives which actuated
Bacon in his criticism. He was jealous of his more successful
contemporaries and desperately anxious to secure
the pope as his patron. If, as Macaulay said, Francis Bacon
seeking the truth was a very different person from Francis
Bacon seeking the seals, we must remember that Roger
Bacon combined both attempts at once. He grieved to see
the neglect by his fellow theologians of the subjects in which
he was particularly interested, and to see himself second in
reputation, influence and advancement to the “boy theologians.”
It angered him that these same narrowly educated
and narrow-minded men should “always teach against these
sciences in their lectures, sermons and conferences.”<a id="FNanchor_2128" href="#Footnote_2128" class="fnanchor">[2128]</a> And
after all, as he tells the pope, he does not wish to revolutionize
the curriculum nor overthrow the existing educational
system, “but that from the table of the Lord, heaped
with wisdom’s spoils, I, poor fellow, may gather the falling
crumbs I need.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_643">[Pg 643]</span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Inaccuracy
of
much of
his criticism.</div>

<p>Bacon’s allusions to and dates for events in the history
of medieval learning are sometimes hard to fit in with what
we learn from other sources, and as we have seen he has
been detected in misstatements of the doctrines of other
scholars.<a id="FNanchor_2129" href="#Footnote_2129" class="fnanchor">[2129]</a> His personal diatribes against the Latin translators
of Greek and Arabian science seem overdrawn and
unfair, especially when he condemns the first translators
for not knowing the sciences in question before they ventured
to translate, whereas it is plain that the sciences could
not be known to the Latin world until the translations had
been made. Indeed, it may be doubted if Roger himself
knew Arabic well enough to read scientific works therein
without a translation or interpreter. Especially unjustifiable
and ill advised seems his savage onslaught upon William
of Moerbeke,<a id="FNanchor_2130" href="#Footnote_2130" class="fnanchor">[2130]</a> whom we are told Aquinas induced to translate
Aristotle from the Greek, who was like Bacon interested
in occult science, and to whom Witelo dedicated his treatise
on optics. As William held the confidential post of papal
chaplain and penitentiary under Clement IV, and as he
became archbishop of Corinth about the time that Roger
was condemned to prison, there may have been some personal
rivalry and bitterness between them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bacon
does not
regard
himself
as unique.</div>

<p>It should be said to Bacon’s credit that his own statements
do not support the inference which others have drawn
from them, that he was alone in the advocacy or pursuit of
the studies dear to him. In the <i>Opus Minus</i> he says to the
pope, with rather unusual modesty it must be admitted, “I
confess that there are several men who can present to Your
Wisdom in a better way than I can these very subjects of
which I treat.”<a id="FNanchor_2131" href="#Footnote_2131" class="fnanchor">[2131]</a> And though the secrets of the arts and
sciences are neglected by the crowd of students and their
masters, “God always has reserved some sages who know
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_644">[Pg 644]</span>
all the necessary elements of wisdom. Not that anyone of
them knows every detail, however, nor the majority of
them; but one knows one subject, another another, so that
the knowledge of such sages ought to be combined.”<a id="FNanchor_2132" href="#Footnote_2132" class="fnanchor">[2132]</a> Combine
it Bacon does for the pope’s perusal, and he is not
ashamed to speak on its behalf, for though there are fewer
Latins conversant with it than there should be, there are
many who would gladly receive it, if they were taught.<a id="FNanchor_2133" href="#Footnote_2133" class="fnanchor">[2133]</a>
Thus he speaks not merely as an exponent of his own ideas,
but as the representative of a movement with a considerable
following at least outside of strictly theological circles.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Instances
of ideas
which
were not
new with
him.</div>

<p>Bacon has been given great credit for pointing out the
need of calendar revision three centuries before the papacy
achieved it; but he says himself that not only wise astronomers
but even ordinary <i>computistae</i> were already aware
of the crying need for reform,<a id="FNanchor_2134" href="#Footnote_2134" class="fnanchor">[2134]</a> and his discussion of the
calendar often coincides verbally with Grosseteste’s <i>Computus</i>.<a id="FNanchor_2135" href="#Footnote_2135" class="fnanchor">[2135]</a>
When Cardinal Pierre d’Ailly over a century later
again urged the need of reform upon Pope John XXIII
he cited Grosseteste often, but Bacon seldom or never.<a id="FNanchor_2136" href="#Footnote_2136" class="fnanchor">[2136]</a>
The Parisian version of the Bible, against which Bacon inveighs
as a corruption of the Vulgate, was in the first instance
the work of a conscientious Hebrew scholar;<a id="FNanchor_2137" href="#Footnote_2137" class="fnanchor">[2137]</a> and
the numerous corrections and changes made in it since,
though deplored by Bacon, show the prevalent interest in
such matters. While Bacon holds that there are very few
men who understand the theory of Greek, Hebrew and
Arabic grammar, or the technique of the sciences which
have to be studied from those languages, he admits that
many men are found among the “Latins” who can speak
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_645">[Pg 645]</span>
those tongues and that there are even plenty of teachers of
Greek and Hebrew at Paris and elsewhere in France and
England.<a id="FNanchor_2138" href="#Footnote_2138" class="fnanchor">[2138]</a> Thus Bacon was not so superior linguistically
to his age as he has sometimes been depicted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bacon and
the discovery
of
America.</div>

<p>The treatment of geography in the <i>Opus Maius</i> is simply
an intelligent compilation of well-known past writers, including
the wretched work of Ethicus, supplemented from
writings of the friars who had recently visited the Tartars.
Roger Bacon’s name has sometimes been connected with
the discovery of America by Columbus on the ground that
Columbus was greatly influenced by the <i>Imago mundi</i> of
Pierre d’Ailly and that a chapter in that work on the extent
of the habitable earth was copied in large measure without
acknowledgment from Roger Bacon.<a id="FNanchor_2139" href="#Footnote_2139" class="fnanchor">[2139]</a> Cardinal d’Ailly,
however, can scarcely be censured for failing to mention
Bacon in this context since he does cite him elsewhere and
since in this passage all that he borrows from Roger are
the statements of other writers whom Roger cites. That
is, against Ptolemy’s discouraging assertion that five-sixths
of the earth’s surface is covered with water he cites Aristotle,
Seneca and Pliny to prove that the distance west from
Spain to India is not great and the apocryphal book of
Esdras to the effect that only one-seventh of the earth’s
surface is covered with water. But it is contended that
the <i>Imago Mundi</i> was not published until 1487<a id="FNanchor_2140" href="#Footnote_2140" class="fnanchor">[2140]</a> and that
Columbus did not read it until after his first voyage in
1492,<a id="FNanchor_2141" href="#Footnote_2141" class="fnanchor">[2141]</a> which is to be regarded as a continuation of the
search after new islands and lands in the western ocean
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_646">[Pg 646]</span>
already undertaken by various Portuguese sailors.<a id="FNanchor_2142" href="#Footnote_2142" class="fnanchor">[2142]</a> It is interesting
to note one argument for the propinquity of northwestern
Africa to India employed by Bacon which d’Ailly,
firm believer in astrology as he was, did not copy. Bacon
argues that Aristotle and his commentator included northwestern
Africa in “Spain,” “since they say as proof of the
narrowness of the sea between Spain and India that there
are elephants only in those two places.” And “Aristotle
says that there cannot be elephants in those places unless
they were of like complexion.”<a id="FNanchor_2143" href="#Footnote_2143" class="fnanchor">[2143]</a>&mdash;i. e., under the same
constellations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bacon’s
historical
attitude.</div>

<p>If in many respects Bacon’s contribution to learning
has been overestimated, there is one side of his thought
which has seldom been emphasized but deserves some notice,
namely, his historical attitude. In one sense history was a
weak point with Bacon as with most of his contemporaries.
He not only accepted the faulty accounts of the past current
in his day, but was apt to pounce upon the most sensational
and incredible details and use these to support his
case. He had no notion of historical criticism. Unfortunately
he thought that he knew a good deal about the history
of philosophy, and his attitude to science is colored by his
false ideas of the history of intellectual development. He
of course knew nothing of evolution or of prehistoric man.
For him intellectual history commenced with a complete
divine revelation of philosophy to the patriarchs. Science
then declined owing to the sinfulness of mankind, the invention
of magic by Zoroaster, and further corruption of wisdom
at the hands of Nimrod, Atlas, Prometheus, Hermes
Trismegistus, Aesculapius, and Apollo. Complete knowledge
and understanding were granted again by God to Solomon,
after whom succeeded another period of sinful decline,
until with Thales began the gradual upbuilding of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_647">[Pg 647]</span>
Greek philosophy culminating in Aristotle. Then night set
in again, until Avicenna revived philosophy among the
Arabs. To him and Aristotle, however, as infidels, less
complete knowledge was vouchsafed than to the representatives
of God’s chosen people.<a id="FNanchor_2144" href="#Footnote_2144" class="fnanchor">[2144]</a> Of the composition and
development of Roman law Bacon had so little notion that
he thought it borrowed chiefly from Aristotle and Theophrastus,
except that the Twelve Tables were derived from
the laws of Solon.<a id="FNanchor_2145" href="#Footnote_2145" class="fnanchor">[2145]</a> Though he saw the value of linguistics
and textual criticism, and sought with true humanistic ardor
for a lost work like the <i>Morals</i> of Seneca, he accepted as
genuine works of antiquity spurious treatises like the <i>De
Vetula</i> ascribed to Ovid.<a id="FNanchor_2146" href="#Footnote_2146" class="fnanchor">[2146]</a> He believed that Paul had corresponded
with Seneca and that Alexander’s conquests were
due to Aristotle’s experimental science. We shall soon see
how he used the astrological interpretation of history, which
was the medieval counterpart of our geographical and economic
interpretation. Yet Bacon deserves praise for so
often opening his discussion of a problem by an inquiry into
its historical background; he at least tried to adopt the historical
point of view. And on the whole his historical
method makes about as close an approach to modern research
as do his mathematics and experimental science to
their modern parallels.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His
“mathematical
method.”</div>

<p>Yet the introduction of mathematical method into natural
science has often been attributed to Roger Bacon, in
which respect he has been favorably contrasted with Francis
Bacon. Therefore it will be well to note exactly what Roger
says on this point and whether his observations were notably
in advance of the thought of his times. It will be recalled
that in his criticism of the teaching of mathematics Roger
had shown little appreciation of the labors of those pure
mathematicians who devoted a lifetime to painstaking demonstration
and were satisfied with nothing short of it. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_648">[Pg 648]</span>
discussion in the <i>Opus Maius</i> opens with strong assertions
of the necessity for a knowledge of mathematics in the study
of natural science and of theology as well; and we are told
that neglect of mathematics for the past thirty or forty
years has been the ruin of Latin learning. This position is
supported by citation of various authorities and by some
vague general arguments in typical scholastic style. Grammar
and logic must employ music, a branch of mathematics,
in prosody and persuasive periods. The categories of time,
place, and quantity require mathematical knowledge for their
comprehension. Mathematics must underlie other subjects
because it is by nature the most elementary and the easiest
to learn and the first discovered. Moreover, all our sense
knowledge is received in space, in time, and quantitatively.
Also the certitude of mathematics makes it desirable that
other studies avail themselves of its aid.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its
crudity.</div>

<p>But now we come to the application of these glittering
generalities and we see what Bacon’s “mathematical
method” really amounts to. Briefly, it consists in expounding
his physical and astronomical theories by means of
simple geometrical diagrams. The atomical doctrine of
Democritus cannot be true, since it involves the error that
the hypothenuse is of the same length as the side of a square.
Geometry satisfies Roger that there can be but one universe;
otherwise we should have a vacuum left. Plato’s assertion
that the heavens and four elements are made up each of one
group of regular solids is also subjected to geometrical
scrutiny. Mathematics is further of service in Biblical geography,
in sacred chronology, and in allegorical interpretation
of the dimensions of the ark, temple, and tabernacle, and
of various numbers which occur in Scripture. But mathematics,
according to Bacon, plays its greatest rôle in astronomy
or astrology and in physics, and in his favorite
theory of multiplication of species or virtues, or, as modern
writers have flatteringly termed it, the propagation of force.<a id="FNanchor_2147" href="#Footnote_2147" class="fnanchor">[2147]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_649">[Pg 649]</span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Its debt
to others.</div>

<p>Astronomy and astrology had together long made up
the world’s supreme science; there was no originality in
urging their importance, and unfortunately it was astrology
rather than astronomy which seemed to Bacon by far the
most important and practical part of mathematics. In
physics he borrowed his discussion of weights and falling
bodies from Jordanus, an earlier writer in the thirteenth
century, and his optics from Alhazen and Grosseteste and
from treatises which passed then under the names of Ptolemy
and Euclid but were perhaps of more recent origin.<a id="FNanchor_2148" href="#Footnote_2148" class="fnanchor">[2148]</a> Bacon’s
graphic expression of the multiplication of species by lines
and figures we find earlier in Grosseteste’s <i>De Lineis, Angulis,
et Figuris</i>.<a id="FNanchor_2149" href="#Footnote_2149" class="fnanchor">[2149]</a> It does not seem, therefore, that Bacon made
any new suggestions of great importance concerning the
application of mathematical method in the sciences, and historians
of mathematics have recognized that “he contributed
nothing to the pure science,”<a id="FNanchor_2150" href="#Footnote_2150" class="fnanchor">[2150]</a> of whose very meaning his
notion was inadequate.</p>

<h4 id="EXPERIMENTAL_SCIENCE">III. <i>His Experimental Science</i></h4>

<div class="sidenote">Has been
given
undue
prominence.</div>

<p>Let us next inquire what contributions, if any, Bacon
made in the direction of modern experimental method.
Jebb’s edition of the <i>Opus Maius</i> in 1733 ended with the
sixth part on “Experimental Science,” which thus received
undue prominence and seemed the climax of the work.
Bridges’ edition added the seventh part on “Moral Philosophy,”
“a science better than all the preceding,” and the text
as now extant, after listing various arguments for the
superiority of Christianity to other religions, concludes
abruptly with an eight-page devout justification and glorification
of the mystery of the Eucharist.</p>

<p>Our preceding chapters have similarly rectified the place
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_650">[Pg 650]</span>
of Bacon’s discussion of experimental science in the history
of thought. We have already brought out the fact that he
was not the first medieval man to advocate experimentation,
but that writers before him contain “experiments,” rely
on experience rather than mere authority, and mention the
existence of other “experimenters” and “experimental
books.” We have noted Petrus Hispanus’ discussion of
“the experimental method” (<i>via experiment</i>), Albertus
Magnus’ experimental school for the study of nature,
Robert Grosseteste’s association of experimentation with
physics, and William of Auvergne’s association of experiment
with natural magic. We have described experiments
of Constantinus Africanus, Adelard of Bath, Pedro Alfonso,
Bernard Silvester, and many others. We have yet to describe
experimental books, many of which antedate Roger
Bacon. His discussion will be found to do little more than
duplicate and reinforce the picture of the medieval status of
experimental method which we have already obtained from
other and earlier sources. He is not a lone herald of the
experimental method of modern science; he merely reveals
and himself represents the merits and the defects of an important
movement of his time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“Experimental
science”
distinct
from
other
natural
sciences.</div>

<p>Bacon’s discussion of “experimental science” and of
experimental method are not quite one and the same thing.
He treats of “experimental science” in a separate section of
the <i>Opus Maius</i>, and seems to regard it as something distinct
from his other natural sciences, such as optics, alchemy,
astronomy and astrology, rather than as an inductive method
through regulated and purposive observation and experience
to the discovery of truth, which should underlie and form
an essential part of them all. Yet he also approaches the
latter conception. But note that, while the sixth part on
“Experimental Science” is not the last section of the <i>Opus
Maius</i>, it is the last of the natural sciences to be discussed
by him there rather than the first. It is not, like modern
experimentation, the source but “the goal of all speculation.”
It is not so much an inductive method of discovering scientific
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_651">[Pg 651]</span>
truth, as it is applied science, the putting the results of
the “speculative” natural sciences to the test of practical
utility. “Other sciences know how to discover their first
principles through experience, but reach their conclusions
by arguments made from the principles so discovered. But
if they require a specific and final test of their conclusions,
then they ought to avail themselves of the aid of this noble
science.”<a id="FNanchor_2151" href="#Footnote_2151" class="fnanchor">[2151]</a> “Natural philosophy narrates and argues but
does not experiment. The student of perspective and the
astronomer put many things to the test of experience, but
not all nor sufficiently. Hence complete experience is reserved
for this science.”<a id="FNanchor_2152" href="#Footnote_2152" class="fnanchor">[2152]</a> It uses the other sciences to
achieve definite practical results; as a navigator orders a
carpenter to build him a ship or a knight tells a smith to
make him a suit of armor, so the <i>experimentator</i> uses his
knowledge of geometry to construct a burning-glass or outdoes
alchemy at its own specialty of gold-making.<a id="FNanchor_2153" href="#Footnote_2153" class="fnanchor">[2153]</a> In
working out these practical inventions, however, the “experimenter”
often happens on new facts and truths of which
the speculative sciences have not dreamed, and in this way
experimental science “by its own power investigates the
secrets of nature.” Thus Bacon begins to see the advisability
of a close alliance between “experimental science” and
natural science, but it is also clear that they are not yet
identified. The artisans of the gilds and the alchemists&mdash;Bacon
includes a discussion of alchemy in the same sixth
section with his “experimental science,” although in a way
keeping the two distinct&mdash;seem to be engaging in this experimental
science more than do the scholars of the books
and schools. As William of Auvergne associated experimentation
with magic rather than with science, so Bacon
seems to regard natural science as largely speculative, and
confirms the impression, which we have already derived from
many other sources, that magicians were the first to “experiment,”
and that “science,” originally speculative, has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_652">[Pg 652]</span>
gradually taken over the experimental method from magic.
This impression will be strengthened as we proceed to
examine in more detail, first Bacon’s “experimental science”
and then what he has to say concerning magic. From now
on, however, we shall credit Bacon with all the traces of
experimental method that we can find anywhere in his writings,
as well as in his separate section on “experimental
science” in the <i>Opus Maius</i> and his further allusions to the
same subject in the <i>Opus Minus</i> and <i>Opus Tertium</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">As a criterion
of
truth.</div>

<p>Bacon not merely emphasizes the importance of experience
in arriving at the truth, but of all sciences regards his
“experimental science” as the best criterion of truth. “All
sciences except this either merely employ arguments to prove
their conclusions, like the purely speculative sciences, or have
universal and imperfect experiences”;<a id="FNanchor_2154" href="#Footnote_2154" class="fnanchor">[2154]</a> while “It alone, in
truth, has the means of finding out to perfection what can
be done by nature, what by the industry of art, what by
fraud”; for it alone can distinguish what is true from what
is false in “incantations, conjurations, invocations, deprecations,
and sacrifices.”<a id="FNanchor_2155" href="#Footnote_2155" class="fnanchor">[2155]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Lack of
method.</div>

<p>But how is one to set about experimenting? On this
point Bacon is disappointing. His explanation of the rainbow,
which is his longest illustration of the value of experimental
science, is based merely on ordinary intelligent observation
and reasoning, although he adds at the close that
tests with instruments are needed and that consequently he
will not assert that he has reached the full truth of the matter.<a id="FNanchor_2156" href="#Footnote_2156" class="fnanchor">[2156]</a>
Elsewhere he speaks of astronomical experiments “by
instruments made for this purpose,” but seems to regard
the unaided eyesight as sufficient for the investigation of
terrestrial phenomena. Bacon has sent “over sea and to
various other lands and to annual fairs, in order that I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_653">[Pg 653]</span>
might see the things of nature with my own eyes.”<a id="FNanchor_2157" href="#Footnote_2157" class="fnanchor">[2157]</a> “And
those things which are not present in our locality we may
know through other sages who have experienced them, just
as Aristotle by authority of Alexander sent two thousand
men to different regions to experience all things on the face
of the earth, as Pliny testifies in his Natural History.”<a id="FNanchor_2158" href="#Footnote_2158" class="fnanchor">[2158]</a>
The one contemporary who most nearly fulfills Bacon’s ideal
of what an experimental scientist should be, does not spend
his time merely in reading, attending lectures, and engaging
in disputations, but “is ashamed to have some layman or old
wife or knight or rustic know facts of which he is ignorant”;
hence he goes out into the world and observes the doings
of common workingmen and even takes hints from the
operations of witches, enchanters and magicians.<a id="FNanchor_2159" href="#Footnote_2159" class="fnanchor">[2159]</a> Bacon
even accepts the notion which we have already often met in
other writers, that valuable medicines can be discovered by
observing what remedies various animals employ. It would
seem that experimental method is in a low state of its development,
if it takes lessons from common human experience
and from the actions of brutes. Bacon sufficiently indicates,
however, that it does not consist merely of observation
and casual experience, but includes purposive experimentation,
and he often speaks of “experimenters.”
Undoubtedly he himself experimented. But the fact remains
that he gives no directions concerning either the proper
environment for experimenting or the proper conduct of
experiments. Of laboratory equipment, of scientific instruments,
of exact measurements, he has no more notion
apparently than his contemporaries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_654">[Pg 654]</span></p><div class="sidenote">Bacon and
inventions.</div>

<p>It cannot be shown that Roger Bacon actually anticipated
any of our modern inventions, nor that to him in particular
were due any of the medieval inventions which revolutionized
domestic life such as chimney flues and window panes, or
navigation such as the rudder and mariner’s compass, or
public and ecclesiastical architecture such as the pointed
vault and flying buttress and stained glass, or reckoning and
writing such as the Hindu-Arabic numerals and paper, or
reading and seeing such as lenses and eye-glasses, or warfare
such as gunpowder.<a id="FNanchor_2160" href="#Footnote_2160" class="fnanchor">[2160]</a> We probably are justified, however,
in accepting such passages in his works as the following,
not merely as dreams that have been brought true by
modern mechanical inventions, but as further indications
that an interest existed in mechanical devices, and that men
were already beginning to struggle with the problems which
have recently been solved.</p>

<p>“Machines for navigation can be made without rowers
so that the largest ships on rivers or seas will be moved
by a single man in charge with greater velocity than if
they were full of men. Also cars can be made so that
without animals they will move with unbelievable rapidity;
such we opine were the scythe-bearing chariots with which
the men of old fought. Also flying machines can be constructed
so that a man sits in the midst of the machine
revolving some engine by which artificial wings are made
to beat the air like a flying bird. Also a machine small
in size for raising or lowering enormous weights, than
which nothing is more useful in emergencies. For by a
machine three fingers high and wide and of less size a
man could free himself and his friends from all danger
of prison and rise and descend. Also a machine can easily
be made by which one man can draw a thousand to himself
by violence against their wills, and attract other things
in like manner. Also machines can be made for walking
in the sea and rivers, even to the bottom without danger.
For Alexander the Great employed such, that he might
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_655">[Pg 655]</span>
see the secrets of the deep, as Ethicus the astronomer tells.
These machines were made in antiquity and they have
certainly been made in our times, except possibly a flying
machine which I have not seen nor do I know any one
who has, but I know an expert who has thought out the
way to make one. And such things can be made almost
without limit, for instance, bridges across rivers without
piers or other supports, and mechanisms, and unheard
of engines.”<a id="FNanchor_2161" href="#Footnote_2161" class="fnanchor">[2161]</a> Since Bacon’s authority concerning Alexander
is unreliable and his conjectures concerning ancient
scythe-bearing chariots unwarranted, we may also doubt
if steamboats and automobiles had “certainly been made”
in his day; but men may have been trying to accomplish
such things.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Marvelous
results expected.</div>

<p>Bacon says far more of the marvelous results which he
expects experimental science to achieve than he does of the
methods by which such results are to be attained. In the
main marvelousness rather than practicability characterizes
the aims which he proposes for <i>scientia experimentalis</i>.
Indeed, of the three ways in which he represents it as
superior to all other sciences, while one is that it employs
sure proofs rather than mere arguments, two are that by
it life may be greatly lengthened, and that from it a better
knowledge of the future may be gained than even from
astrology.<a id="FNanchor_2162" href="#Footnote_2162" class="fnanchor">[2162]</a> Thus experimental method is especially connected
with alchemy and astrology. Bacon declares that “it
has been proved by certain experiments” that life can be
greatly prolonged “by secret experiences.”<a id="FNanchor_2163" href="#Footnote_2163" class="fnanchor">[2163]</a> and he believes
that Artephius was enabled by such methods to live for a
thousand and twenty-five years.<a id="FNanchor_2164" href="#Footnote_2164" class="fnanchor">[2164]</a> Or experimental science
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_656">[Pg 656]</span>
may predict the weather by observing the behavior of
animals.<a id="FNanchor_2165" href="#Footnote_2165" class="fnanchor">[2165]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Fantastic
“experiments.”</div>

<p>Some of Bacon’s “experiments” are as fantastic as the
aims are marvelous. “A good experimenter says in the book
<i>De regimine senum</i>” that the following elixir will greatly
prolong life: “that which is temperate in the fourth degree,
and what swims in the sea, and what grows in the air, and
what is cast up by the sea, and plant of India, and what is
found in the entrails of an animal of long life, and those two
serpents which are the food of the inhabitants of Tyre and
Ethiopia.”<a id="FNanchor_2166" href="#Footnote_2166" class="fnanchor">[2166]</a> We also are told that “at Paris recently there
was a sage who asked for snakes and was given one and cut
it into small sections except that the skin of its belly on
which it crawled remained intact; and that snake crawled
as best it could to a certain herb by touching which it was
instantly made whole. And the experimenter collected an
herb of wonderful virtue.”<a id="FNanchor_2167" href="#Footnote_2167" class="fnanchor">[2167]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Credulity
essential.</div>

<p>Credulity, in contrast to the sceptical attitude of modern
science is a characteristic of Bacon’s experimental method.
He declares, it is true, that experiment disproves many false
notions such as that hot water freezes faster than cold, that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_657">[Pg 657]</span>
adamant can be broken only with the blood of a goat, and
that the beaver when hunted castrates itself to save its life;<a id="FNanchor_2168" href="#Footnote_2168" class="fnanchor">[2168]</a>
but we have already heard such beliefs questioned by Albertus
Magnus and others. On the other hand, Bacon asserts
that credulity is necessary to experimentation. “First one
should be credulous until experience follows second and
reason comes third.... At first one should believe those
who have made experiments or who have faithful testimony
from others who have done so, nor should one reject the
truth because he is ignorant of it and because he has no
argument for it.”<a id="FNanchor_2169" href="#Footnote_2169" class="fnanchor">[2169]</a> Taken as a plea for an open-minded
attitude toward scientific investigation on the part of the
ordinary man and of the ecclesiastical authorities, this utterance
may be commended; but as a prescription for the scientific
investigator it is dangerous. Many of Bacon’s “experiments”
are copied from books, and the reproach made
against the Greek Empirics that they followed tradition,
applies also to him. Describing a certain marvel of nature,
he exclaims, “After I beheld this, there was nothing difficult
for my mind to believe, provided it had a reliable author.”<a id="FNanchor_2170" href="#Footnote_2170" class="fnanchor">[2170]</a>
In the midst of his discussion of experimental science we
encounter the following instance of his gullibility:</p>

<div class="sidenote">Good
flying
dragons.</div>

<p>“It is certain that Ethiopian sages have come into Italy,
Spain, France, England, and those Christian lands where
there are good flying dragons; and by an occult art that they
possess, excite the dragons from their caves. And they
have saddles and bridles ready, and they ride the dragons,
and drive them at top speed through the air, in order to
soften the rigidity and toughness of their flesh, just as boars,
bears, and bulls are hunted with dogs and beaten with many
blows before they are killed for eating. And when they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_658">[Pg 658]</span>
have tamed the dragons in this way, they have an art of
preparing their flesh ... which they employ against the
accidents of age and prolong life and inspire the intellect
beyond all estimation. For no education which man can
give will bestow such wisdom as does the eating of their
flesh, as we have learned without deceit or doubt from men
of proved trustworthiness.”<a id="FNanchor_2171" href="#Footnote_2171" class="fnanchor">[2171]</a></p>

<p>Bacon’s discussion of experimental science, therefore,
on its positive side amounts to little more than a recognition
of experience as a criterion of truth and a promulgation
of the phrase “Experimental science” which, however, he
himself ascribes to Ptolemy.<a id="FNanchor_2172" href="#Footnote_2172" class="fnanchor">[2172]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Experiment
and
magic.</div>

<p>On the other hand, the credulity, the superstition, the
element of marvelousness, which seem to vitiate the experimental
tendencies of Bacon, are to be explained as the
result of a real connection between experiment and magic.
There is abundant evidence for this. Bacon, it is true,
asserts that experimental science exposes and shuns all the
follies of the magicians, but he admits that many persons
confuse it with magic because of the marvels which it works,
and he himself especially associates it with the occult sciences
of alchemy and astrology. It makes gold such as
neither the art of alchemy nor nature can produce; it can
predict the future better than astrology.<a id="FNanchor_2173" href="#Footnote_2173" class="fnanchor">[2173]</a> It teaches one to
choose the proper constellations for his undertakings, and
to use the right words at the proper times;<a id="FNanchor_2174" href="#Footnote_2174" class="fnanchor">[2174]</a> it can construct
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_659">[Pg 659]</span>
“philosophical images and incantations and characters”
which are vastly superior to those of magic;<a id="FNanchor_2175" href="#Footnote_2175" class="fnanchor">[2175]</a> it can alter
the world about us, and incline and excite the human will,
though without coercion.<a id="FNanchor_2176" href="#Footnote_2176" class="fnanchor">[2176]</a> Moreover, Bacon’s ideal experimental
scientist does not scorn to take hints from wizards,
while Roger himself derives his hazel rod experiment from
the magicians. The snake experiment of his sage at Paris
sounds more like the trick of a Hindu conjurer than the
procedure of a modern laboratory.</p>

<h4>IV. <i>His Attitude Toward Magic and Astrology</i></h4>

<div class="sidenote">Magic
and astrology.</div>

<p>Thus we are finally led to a consideration of the magic
and astrology which were evidently so closely connected
with Bacon’s mathematics and experimental science. Roger
admits a certain connection between magic and astrology,
since he adopts Hugh of St. Victor’s fivefold division
of magic into <i>mantice</i>, <i>mathematica</i>, <i>sortilegium</i>, <i>praestigium</i>
and <i>maleficium</i>.<a id="FNanchor_2177" href="#Footnote_2177" class="fnanchor">[2177]</a> However, except for this superstitious
<i>mathematica</i> he approves of astrology, whereas his
attitude towards magic is uniformly one of condemnation
and contempt. We shall therefore take up his treatments
of the two subjects separately.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Magic in
the past.</div>

<p>Bacon discusses or alludes to “magic” in a number of
passages scattered through his works, and to it is more
particularly devoted the “Letter on the secret works of art
and nature and the nullity of magic,” a treatise which faithfully
reproduces his point of view whether actually penned
by him as it stands or not.<a id="FNanchor_2178" href="#Footnote_2178" class="fnanchor">[2178]</a> Bacon had evidently read a
good deal about magic and gives a rather unusual account of
its position in the Roman Empire and early Christian period,
but one which is not so very far from the truth. His idea
is that there were three great conflicting and contending
forces in the early centuries of the Christian era, namely,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_660">[Pg 660]</span>
Christianity, philosophy, and magic, and that each one of
these was then in opposition to the other two, although
there was no sufficient reason for the permanent hostility
of Christianity and philosophy, which have since become
allies.<a id="FNanchor_2179" href="#Footnote_2179" class="fnanchor">[2179]</a> But at the time the result was that the philosophers
often accused the Christians of practicing magic, and that
the early Christians similarly confused philosophers with
magicians, as indeed was often done by uneducated men
of the time who were not Christians. Moreover, Bacon
complains that this confusion still exists in his own time
and that contemporary theologians, Gratian in his work on
Canon law, and “many saints” have condemned many
useful and splendid sciences along with magic.<a id="FNanchor_2180" href="#Footnote_2180" class="fnanchor">[2180]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Magicians
and their
books still
prevalent.</div>

<p>Roger himself, however, not only regards magic as rife
in antiquity, but as still prevalent in his own time. He
often refers to contemporary magicians and witches, old-wives
and wizards. He declares that every nation is full
of their superstitions.<a id="FNanchor_2181" href="#Footnote_2181" class="fnanchor">[2181]</a> He is another medieval witness
to the currency of a considerable body of occult literature,
of which he speaks especially in the second and third chapters
of the <i>Epistola de secretis operibus</i>, and again in his
commentary on <i>The Secret of Secrets</i>. “Books of the
magicians” are in circulation which are falsely attributed to
Solomon and the ancient philosophers and which “assume
a grand-sounding style,” but which “ought all to be prohibited
by law, since they abound in so many lies that one
cannot distinguish the true from the false.”<a id="FNanchor_2182" href="#Footnote_2182" class="fnanchor">[2182]</a> Such works
as <i>De officiis spirituum</i>, <i>De morte animae</i>, and <i>De arte
notoria</i> embody only “figments of the magicians.” Yet these
books of false <i>mathematici</i> and demons, ascribed to Adam,
Moses, Solomon, Aristotle, and Hermes, have seduced not
only youths but mature and famous men of Bacon’s own
time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Magic a
delusion.</div>

<p>Bacon, indeed, despite the prevalence of magic both in
antiquity and in his own time, regards it as essentially a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_661">[Pg 661]</span>
delusion. It is “the nullity of magic” that he especially attempts
to demonstrate both in the <i>Epistola de secretis
operibus</i> and elsewhere in his works. He is medieval Christian
enough, it is true, to grant that magic may perform
marvels by the aid of demons.<a id="FNanchor_2183" href="#Footnote_2183" class="fnanchor">[2183]</a> But he also accepts the
orthodox belief that magicians cannot coerce the demons
by their invocations, sacrifices, and employment of the properties
of natural objects, and that the evil spirits in reality
respond only with evil intent and as God permits.<a id="FNanchor_2184" href="#Footnote_2184" class="fnanchor">[2184]</a> But
his emphasis is not, like Augustine’s upon the “host of wonders”
which magicians work by demon aid. He seems to
be sounding, not a religious retreat from magic, but a
rational and scientific attack upon it. Nor does he dwell
much on the criminal character of magic, although he calls
the magicians <i>maledicti</i>&mdash;“of evil repute.”<a id="FNanchor_2185" href="#Footnote_2185" class="fnanchor">[2185]</a> What impresses
him most about magic, and the charge which he
most often brings against it, is its fraud and futility. Twice
he speaks of things as “false and magical”;<a id="FNanchor_2186" href="#Footnote_2186" class="fnanchor">[2186]</a> he mentions
the “figments of the magicians”;<a id="FNanchor_2187" href="#Footnote_2187" class="fnanchor">[2187]</a> and associates magic
and necromancy, not like Albert with astronomy, but with
deception.<a id="FNanchor_2188" href="#Footnote_2188" class="fnanchor">[2188]</a> For him magicians are neither <i>magni</i> nor
philosophers and astronomers; in half a dozen passages he
classes them with old-wives and witches.<a id="FNanchor_2189" href="#Footnote_2189" class="fnanchor">[2189]</a> He will not
admit that they employ valid natural forces. He represents
magic as using sleight-of-hand, ventriloquism, subtle mechanism,
darkness and confederates to simulate results which
it is unable to perform.<a id="FNanchor_2190" href="#Footnote_2190" class="fnanchor">[2190]</a> He further represents the magicians
as “stupidly trusting in characters and incantations,”<a id="FNanchor_2191" href="#Footnote_2191" class="fnanchor">[2191]</a> and
affirms that “the human voice has not that power which
magicians imagine it has.”<a id="FNanchor_2192" href="#Footnote_2192" class="fnanchor">[2192]</a> When words are employed
in magic, “either the magician accomplishes nothing, or the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_662">[Pg 662]</span>
devil is the author of the feat.”<a id="FNanchor_2193" href="#Footnote_2193" class="fnanchor">[2193]</a> Magical incantations and
formulae are made haphazard and at anyone’s pleasure; they
therefore possess no natural transforming power, and if
they seem to effect anything, this is really the work of
demons.<a id="FNanchor_2194" href="#Footnote_2194" class="fnanchor">[2194]</a> Similarly Bacon regards as worthless the assertion
of the magicians and witches that sudden transformations
may be produced by any man at any time of day.<a id="FNanchor_2195" href="#Footnote_2195" class="fnanchor">[2195]</a>
He dismisses “fascination by word alone uttered at haphazard”
as “a stupid notion characteristic of magic and of
old-wives and beneath the notice of philosophers.” Here
again nothing is accomplished, “unless the devil because
of men’s sins operates unbeknownst.”<a id="FNanchor_2196" href="#Footnote_2196" class="fnanchor">[2196]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Some
truth in
magic.</div>

<p>In certain passages, however, Bacon suggests that magic
is not utterly worthless and that some truth may be derived
from it. The experimental scientist whom he most admired
“investigated even the <i>experiments</i> and lot-castings of old
women”&mdash;note that they too were experimenters&mdash;“and
their charms and those of all the magicians, and likewise
the illusions and devices of all the conjurers”; and he did
so not merely that he might be able to expose their deceptions,
but also “so that nothing that ought to be known
might escape him.”<a id="FNanchor_2197" href="#Footnote_2197" class="fnanchor">[2197]</a> And his experimental science not
merely “considered all the follies of the magicians, not to
confirm them but to shun them, just as logic deals with
sophistry”; but also “so that all falsity may be removed and
the truth of the art alone retained.”<a id="FNanchor_2198" href="#Footnote_2198" class="fnanchor">[2198]</a> Roger himself in
the case of the split hazel rod discovered a natural phenomenon
concealed by use of a magic incantation. Bacon
also granted that the books of the magicians “may contain
some truth.”<a id="FNanchor_2199" href="#Footnote_2199" class="fnanchor">[2199]</a> It also was apparently very difficult to distinguish
them from other writings, since he states that many
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_663">[Pg 663]</span>
books are reputed magical which are nothing of the sort but
contain sound learning;<a id="FNanchor_2200" href="#Footnote_2200" class="fnanchor">[2200]</a> since he calls the magicians “corrupters
of wisdom’s records,”<a id="FNanchor_2201" href="#Footnote_2201" class="fnanchor">[2201]</a> and charges them not only
with fraudulently ascribing various “enormities” to Solomon,
but with misinterpreting and abusing “enigmatical
writings” which he believes Solomon really wrote;<a id="FNanchor_2202" href="#Footnote_2202" class="fnanchor">[2202]</a> and
since he tells us that even true philosophers have sometimes
made use of meaningless incantations and characters in order
to conceal their meaning. He consequently concludes that
experience will show which books are good and which are
bad, and that “if anyone finds the work of nature and art
in one of them, let him receive it; if not, abandon the book
as open to suspicion.”<a id="FNanchor_2203" href="#Footnote_2203" class="fnanchor">[2203]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Magic and
science.</div>

<p>Indeed, Bacon seems to think that magic has taken such
a hold upon men that it can be uprooted only by scientific
exposition of its tricks and by scientific achievement of
even greater marvels than it professes to perform. Perhaps
he realizes that religious censure or rationalistic
argument is not enough to turn men from these alluring
arts, but that science must show unto them yet a
more excellent way, and afford scope for that laudable
curiosity, that inventive and exploring instinct which magic
pretends to gratify. He waxes enthusiastic over “the secret
works of art and nature,” and contends that the wonders of
nature and the possibilities of applied science far outshine
the feats of magicians.<a id="FNanchor_2204" href="#Footnote_2204" class="fnanchor">[2204]</a> One reason why early Christian
writers so often confounded philosophy and magic together
was, in his opinion, that the philosophers by their marvelous
exploitation of the forces of nature equalled both the illusions
of magic and the miracles of the Christians.<a id="FNanchor_2205" href="#Footnote_2205" class="fnanchor">[2205]</a> Science,
in short, not merely attacks magic’s front; it can turn its
flank and cut it off from its base of supplies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_664">[Pg 664]</span></p><div class="sidenote">His
belief in
marvelous
“extraneous
virtues.”</div>

<p>But Bacon’s science is sometimes occult science. In the
first place he shared the common belief of his time that
“herbs and stones and metals and other things” possess
“almost miraculous” powers.<a id="FNanchor_2206" href="#Footnote_2206" class="fnanchor">[2206]</a> By thorough investigation
of such occult virtues Artephius prolonged his existence to
one thousand and twenty-five years. “Moreover, there are
numerous things which kill every venomous animal by the
slightest contact; and if a circle is drawn about such animals
with objects of this sort, they cannot get out but die without
having been touched. And if a man is stung by a
venomous animal, he can be cured by a little powder scraped
from such objects, as Bede writes in his <i>Ecclesiastical History</i>
and as we know by experience. And so there are
innumerable things which have extraneous virtues of this
sort, of whose powers we are ignorant from mere neglect
of experimentation.”<a id="FNanchor_2207" href="#Footnote_2207" class="fnanchor">[2207]</a> By calling such virtues “extraneous”
Bacon seems to imply that they cannot be accounted for by
the properties of the elements composing the objects, and
perhaps further that they are of celestial origin. This
points on to his belief in astrology.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Non-magical
fascination.</div>

<p>But Bacon goes farther than that, for some of his
“secret works of art and nature” we must regard as plain
cases of magic procedure, and they would indeed be so
classified by most of our authors. Bacon really goes about
as far as Albertus Magnus in credulous acceptance of superstition,
but will not admit, as Albert does, that such things
are magic or very closely related to it. The incantations
and characters, the fascination and marvelous transformations
of magic Bacon condemns, but he does not condemn
all incantations and characters, nor disbelieve in marvelous
transformations and fascination. While he regards haphazard
fascination as magic, he holds that just as certain
bodily diseases are contagious, so if some malignant soul
thinks hard of infecting another, and desires this ardently,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_665">[Pg 665]</span>
and has full confidence in its own power to inflict such
injury, “there is no doubt that nature will obey thought, as
Avicenna”&mdash;who seems to have been the leading medieval
authority on the subject of fascination&mdash;“shows in his
eighth book on animals and in his fourth book on the soul:
... and this much is not magic.”<a id="FNanchor_2208" href="#Footnote_2208" class="fnanchor">[2208]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The power
of words.</div>

<p>Bacon makes a close connection between fascination and
the power of words and of the human voice, since in his
opinion both are largely due to the rational soul. Words
are the soul’s most appropriate instrument and almost every
miracle since the beginning of the world has been performed
by using them.<a id="FNanchor_2209" href="#Footnote_2209" class="fnanchor">[2209]</a> “For where the attention, desire and virtue
of the rational soul, which is worthier than the stars, concur
with the power of the sky, it is inevitable that either a word
or some other instrument of marvelous power be produced
which will alter the things of this world, so that not only
natural objects but also souls will be inclined to those ends
which the wise operator desires.”<a id="FNanchor_2210" href="#Footnote_2210" class="fnanchor">[2210]</a> Again in the <i>Opus
Tertium</i> we are told that, while the magician accomplishes
nothing by words, the wise man may for this reason. “When
words are uttered with deep thought and great desire and
good intention and firm confidence, they have great virtue.
For when these four qualities unite, the substance of the
rational being is strongly excited to radiate its own species
and virtues from itself into its own body and foreign matter.”<a id="FNanchor_2211" href="#Footnote_2211" class="fnanchor">[2211]</a>
The rational soul influences the voice, which in turn
affects the atmosphere and all objects contained therein. The
physical constitution of the speaker also has some influence,
and finally the positions of the stars must by all means be
taken into account.<a id="FNanchor_2212" href="#Footnote_2212" class="fnanchor">[2212]</a> All this reasoning is equivalent to accepting
the power of incantations, for as Bacon states, “They
are words brought forth by the exertion of the rational soul,
and receive the virtue of the sky as they are pronounced.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_666">[Pg 666]</span><a id="FNanchor_2213" href="#Footnote_2213" class="fnanchor">[2213]</a>
Through their power bodies are healed, venomous animals
put to flight, and other such effects produced. If incantations
are made as described above, “then they are philosophical
and the work of a sage wisely enchanting, as David the
prophet says.”<a id="FNanchor_2214" href="#Footnote_2214" class="fnanchor">[2214]</a> Bacon, however, recognizes that he is dealing
with a delicate matter in which it is hard to distinguish
between philosophy and magic.<a id="FNanchor_2215" href="#Footnote_2215" class="fnanchor">[2215]</a> Of his further discussion
of characters and images, and effort to show that they need
not be magical, we shall treat presently in connection with
his astrology. In his introduction to <i>The Secret of Secrets</i>
he holds that the prayers and sacrifices of Aristotle and other
philosophers were licit and not idolatrous.<a id="FNanchor_2216" href="#Footnote_2216" class="fnanchor">[2216]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Magic and
science
again.</div>

<p>Thus Bacon fails in his attempt to draw the line between
science and magic, and shows, as William of
Auvergne, Albertus Magnus, and others have already
shown, how inextricably the two subjects were intertwined
in his time. His own science still clings to many occult
and magical theories and practices, while he admits that
the magicians often try or pretend to use scientific books
and methods, and that it is no easy matter to tell which
books and characters and images are which. The experimental
scientist not only exposes the frauds of magic but
discovers secrets of nature hidden beneath the husk of
magical ceremony and pretense. Also some men employ
the marvels of philosophy for wicked ends and so pervert
it into a sort of magic. Finally in one passage he forgets
himself and speaks of “those magnificent sciences” which
properly employ “images, characters, charms, prayers, and
deprecations” as “magical sciences.”<a id="FNanchor_2217" href="#Footnote_2217" class="fnanchor">[2217]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_667">[Pg 667]</span></p>
<div class="sidenote">The multiplication
of species.</div>

<p>Bacon’s doctrine of the multiplication of species is a
good illustration of the combination of magic and science
which we encounter in his works. This theory has been
praised by his admirers as the propagation of force subject
to mathematical law; and he has been commended for describing
the species which every agent causes in all directions
not, like the idols of Lucretius, as material films which
peel off from the agent and impress themselves on surrounding
matter, but as successive effects produced in that
matter. Bacon usually illustrates his theory by the radiation
of light from the sun, and by a discussion of the geometrical
laws of reflection and refraction; thus his theory
seems at first sight a physical one. He believed, however,
that the occult influences of the planets upon nature and
man were exercised in the same way, and also such mysterious
powers as those of the evil eye and of fascination.
Indeed, he asserts that this multiplication of virtues is universal,
and that spiritual beings as well as corporeal objects
affect in this manner everything about them and may themselves
be so affected by other objects and beings.<a id="FNanchor_2218" href="#Footnote_2218" class="fnanchor">[2218]</a> Viewed
from this angle, his theory seems a magical one of occult
influence, though given a scientific guise by its assumption
that such forces proceed along mathematical lines after the
analogy of rays of light. This suggests that it is not fair
merely to call Bacon’s science superstitious; we must also
note that he tries to make his magic scientific. But finally
we must note that this doctrine was not original with Bacon;
we have already met with it in Alkindi’s work on stellar
rays.<a id="FNanchor_2219" href="#Footnote_2219" class="fnanchor">[2219]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_668">[Pg 668]</span></p><div class="sidenote">William
of St.
Cloud on
works of
art and
nature
compared
to magic.</div>

<p>It is interesting to find Bacon’s belief that the works of
art and nature can exceed those of magic, and his charge that
unscientific persons are confusing such works with magic,
repeated by another writer. William of St. Cloud composed
astronomical tables based upon his own observations during
the period from about 1285 to 1321, in which he detected
errors in the earlier tables of Thebit, Toulouse, and Toledo.
This experimental astronomer, speaking of the powers of
mirrors and lenses, such as those of Archimedes, those by
which Caesar saw Britain from the shores of Gaul, and that
by which Socrates discovered a dragon in the air, says:
“These marvels and many others have been performed in
ancient times, not by magic art, as some would have it, who
are ignorant of the secrets of nature and of scientific industry,
but solely by the force of nature and the aid of art.”<a id="FNanchor_2220" href="#Footnote_2220" class="fnanchor">[2220]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The two
mathematics.</div>

<p>We now turn to Bacon’s attitude towards astrology,
which we have already seen was an important factor in his
“secret works of art and nature” as well as in his mathematics.
He was aware that the <i>mathematici</i> or astrologers
of the Roman Empire had been condemned by some of the
church fathers, and were classed as practitioners of magic
by more recent theologians and writers on Canon law. Like
Isidore, Albertus Magnus, and other authors whom we have
already discussed, Bacon gets around this by distinguishing
two varieties of mathematics, one of which he says is magic,
condemned by Cicero in his <i>De divinatione</i> and by other classical
authorities as well as by the church fathers, the other
a department of philosophy, a branch of which Augustine,
Ambrose, Basil, Cassiodorus, and Gregory all approved. In
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_669">[Pg 669]</span>
the <i>Opus Maius</i> and <i>Opus Tertium</i> he states as usual that the
“e” is long in the magical art of divination, while the vowel
is short in the philosophical study; but in other writings he
changed his mind and declared that “all the Latins” were
wrong in this opinion and that the distinction was just the
opposite.<a id="FNanchor_2221" href="#Footnote_2221" class="fnanchor">[2221]</a> Bacon also cites Isidore’s distinction between two
kinds of “astronomy”; one natural science, the other superstitious.
Roger himself sometimes uses the words “astrology”
and “astronomy” indifferently; sometimes speaks of
“astrology” as speculative and “astronomy” as practical;
sometimes distinguishes between speculative and practical
astrology, of which the last includes judicial astrology.<a id="FNanchor_2222" href="#Footnote_2222" class="fnanchor">[2222]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Four objections
to
the forbidden
variety.</div>

<p>Four features, to Bacon’s mind, distinguish the forbidden
<i>mathematica</i> from legitimate judicial astrology.<a id="FNanchor_2223" href="#Footnote_2223" class="fnanchor">[2223]</a> In
the first place, it ascribes fatal necessity to the influence of
the stars, whereas Bacon shows by an examination of the
writings of Haly, Ptolemy, Avicenna, Messahala, and Isaac
that learned and legitimate astrologers have never held any
such tenet as fatal necessity, although common report may
ignorantly ascribe such doctrine to them.<a id="FNanchor_2224" href="#Footnote_2224" class="fnanchor">[2224]</a> In the second
place, the practitioners of the magical variety of mathematics
“invoke demons by conjurations and sacrifices to supplement
the influence of the constellations, an execrable practice.”
Third, “they mar their astrological observations by the idlest
sort of circles, figures, and characters, and by the stupidest
incantations and unreasonable prayers in which they put
their trust.” Finally they often resort to fraud, employing
confederates, darkness, deceptive mechanisms, and sleight-of-hand.
By such methods “in which they know there is illusion”
and “in which there is no virtue of the sky operating,”
“they perform many feats which seem marvelous to
the stupid.”<a id="FNanchor_2225" href="#Footnote_2225" class="fnanchor">[2225]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_670">[Pg 670]</span></p><div class="sidenote">The rule
of the
stars.</div>

<p>While thus censuring the <i>mathematica</i> which is a subdivision
of magic, Bacon declared that “it is manifest to
everyone that the celestial bodies are the causes of generation
and corruption in all inferior things.”<a id="FNanchor_2226" href="#Footnote_2226" class="fnanchor">[2226]</a> Had not Aristotle
in his treatise on Generation and Corruption said that
the four terrestrial elements are related to the heavens as tools
to an artificer?<a id="FNanchor_2227" href="#Footnote_2227" class="fnanchor">[2227]</a> Bacon regarded the stars as ungenerated,
incorruptible, and voluntary in their movements, which were
regulated by angelic intelligences.<a id="FNanchor_2228" href="#Footnote_2228" class="fnanchor">[2228]</a> He also accepted the
usual technique of the astrological art in explaining the operation
of this celestial influence.<a id="FNanchor_2229" href="#Footnote_2229" class="fnanchor">[2229]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Astrological
medicine.</div>

<p>Bacon naturally subjected the human body to the constellations
and was a firm believer in astrological medicine.
If a doctor is ignorant of “astronomy,” his medical treatment
will be dependent upon “chance and fortune.”<a id="FNanchor_2230" href="#Footnote_2230" class="fnanchor">[2230]</a> Bacon
holds not only that at conception and at birth one’s fundamental
“complexion,” or physical constitution, is determined
by the sky,<a id="FNanchor_2231" href="#Footnote_2231" class="fnanchor">[2231]</a> but that with each changing hour our bodies
are governed by a different planet whose characteristics the
physician should know. Where Neckam<a id="FNanchor_2232" href="#Footnote_2232" class="fnanchor">[2232]</a> had assigned six
hours to the planet after which the day was named, that is,
the first three and last three hours of the twenty-four, Bacon
assigns it only four hours, namely, the first, eighth, fifteenth
and twenty-second. Then, in order to bring the proper
planet into control of the first hour of the succeeding day,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_671">[Pg 671]</span>
he is obliged to have them follow each other in a different
order in their rule of hours from that in which the days of
the week are named.<a id="FNanchor_2233" href="#Footnote_2233" class="fnanchor">[2233]</a> Bacon also distributes the parts of the
body among the signs of the zodiac,<a id="FNanchor_2234" href="#Footnote_2234" class="fnanchor">[2234]</a> and states that the
physician must observe the moon carefully.<a id="FNanchor_2235" href="#Footnote_2235" class="fnanchor">[2235]</a> He cites Hippocrates,
Galen, the <i>Centiloquium</i> and Haly concerning the
great influence of the stars both upon health and the administering
of medicines.<a id="FNanchor_2236" href="#Footnote_2236" class="fnanchor">[2236]</a> That the patriarchs of the Old Testament
lived so much longer than men do to-day has been explained
by many, Bacon says, as due to the stars. His explanation
of the strange case of a woman of Norwich who
ate nothing for twenty years and yet was during all that time
in the best of health is that some constellation must have reduced
the concourse of the four elements in her body to a
self-sufficient harmony such as they seldom attain.<a id="FNanchor_2237" href="#Footnote_2237" class="fnanchor">[2237]</a> Indeed,
he goes so far as to hold that the resurrected body will have
that harmony of the elements and so endure through eternity,
no matter whether raised to the bliss of heaven or subjected
to the consuming torments of hell.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Influence
of the
stars upon
human
conduct.</div>

<p>Bacon even held that the stars by their influence upon
the human body incline men to bad acts and evil arts or to
good conduct and useful sciences. Such natural inclinations
might, however, be resisted by effort of will, modified by divine
grace, or strengthened by diabolic tempting.<a id="FNanchor_2238" href="#Footnote_2238" class="fnanchor">[2238]</a> But while
the individual by an effort of will may resist the force of the
stars, in masses of men the power of the constellations usually
prevails; and the differences in peoples inhabiting different
parts of the earth are due to their being under different
aspects of the sky. Recent bloody wars might have been
avoided, had men harkened to warnings written in the sky.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_672">[Pg 672]</span>
“Oh, how great profit to the church of God might have been
procured, if the disposition of the sky for those times had
been foreseen by the wise, and known to prelates and princes,
and restricted by zeal for peace! Then there would not have
been such slaughter of Christians nor so many souls sent
below.”<a id="FNanchor_2239" href="#Footnote_2239" class="fnanchor">[2239]</a> The personality of the king, too, has such great
influence upon his kingdom that it is worth while to examine
his horoscope carefully.<a id="FNanchor_2240" href="#Footnote_2240" class="fnanchor">[2240]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Planetary
conjunctions
and
religious
movements.</div>

<p>Bacon was especially attracted by the doctrine of Albumasar
concerning conjunctions of the planets, and derived
comforting evidence of the superiority of the Christian faith
to other religions from the astrological explanation of the
origin of religious sects according to the successive conjunctions
of the other planets with Jupiter.<a id="FNanchor_2241" href="#Footnote_2241" class="fnanchor">[2241]</a> He was pleased by
the association of Christianity with Mercury, which he calls
the lord of wisdom and eloquence, of oracles and prophecies;
it is dominant only in the sign Virgo, which at once suggests
the Virgin Mary; and its orbit, difficult to trace because
of epicycle and eccentric, typifies well the Christian
creed with its mysteries that defy reason. Similarly the
malign force of the moon, productive of necromancy and
magic, fits Antichrist exactly; and Venus corresponds to the
sensuality of Mohammedanism. Further astrological evidences
of Christianity are the coincidence six years before
the birth of Christ of an important conjunction of Saturn
and Jupiter with a tenth revolution of Saturn, which last
occurs only at intervals of 320 years, and always marks
some great historical change like the advent of Alexander
or Manes or Mohammed. Astrology further assures us
that Islam can endure only 693 years, a prediction in close
agreement with the number of the beast in the Apocalypse,
663 (<i>sic</i>); the small discrepancy of thirty years is readily
accounted for by the dictum of the venerable Bede that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_673">[Pg 673]</span>
“Scripture in many places subtracts something from the
complete number, for that’s the way with Scripture.”<a id="FNanchor_2242" href="#Footnote_2242" class="fnanchor">[2242]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Was
Christ
born
under the
stars?</div>

<p>The astronomers, Bacon tells the pope, further assure us
that even the Virgin Birth of Christ and His Nativity were
in accordance with the constellations. They think that God
willed so to order His works that certain future events which
He foresaw or predestined should be revealed to the wise
through the planets, in order that the human mind, recognizing
God’s marvelous works, might increase in love
towards Him. They grant that it is impossible that the
Creator be subject to a creature, or that the birth of Christ,
in so far as it was supernatural, should be subject in any way
to the influence of the stars, which in this respect could only
be signs of the divine work. But in so far as the birth of
Jesus was a natural event and His nature was human, they
regard Him as under the influence of the constellations, like
the rest of humanity. Their statements in such matters
should, however, Bacon more cautiously adds, be brought
into conformity with the doctrines of the Catholic faith.<a id="FNanchor_2243" href="#Footnote_2243" class="fnanchor">[2243]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Operative
astrology.</div>

<p>Bacon believed that by means of astrology not only could
the future be in large measure foretold, but also marvelous
operations and great alterations could be effected throughout
the whole world, especially by choosing favorable hours and
by employing astronomical amulets and characters&mdash;in other
words, by the arts of elections and of images.<a id="FNanchor_2244" href="#Footnote_2244" class="fnanchor">[2244]</a> As the babe
at birth receives from the stars that fundamental physical
constitution which lasts it through life, so any new-made
object is permanently affected by the disposition of the constellations
at the moment of its making.<a id="FNanchor_2245" href="#Footnote_2245" class="fnanchor">[2245]</a> Especially by
images, “if they are engraved in accordance with the aspect
of the sky in the elect times, can all injuries be repelled and
useful undertakings promoted.”<a id="FNanchor_2246" href="#Footnote_2246" class="fnanchor">[2246]</a> Bacon not only cites as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_674">[Pg 674]</span>
authorities concerning them Haly’s commentary on the <i>Centiloquium</i>
supposed to be by Ptolemy, Thabit ben Corra, and
the spurious <i>Secret of Secrets</i> of Aristotle; but believes that
Moses and Solomon both made use of them.<a id="FNanchor_2247" href="#Footnote_2247" class="fnanchor">[2247]</a> The marvelous
power of spoken words is also in part accounted for by
Bacon by the celestial influence prevalent at the moment of
utterance. “Although the efficacious employment of words
is primarily the function of the rational soul,” nevertheless
“the astronomer can form words in elect times which will
possess unspeakable power” of transforming natural objects
and even inclining human minds to obey him.<a id="FNanchor_2248" href="#Footnote_2248" class="fnanchor">[2248]</a> Thus Bacon’s
“astronomer” is really a magician and enchanter as well&mdash;one
more of the many indications we have met that there is
no dividing line between magic and astrology: divination is
magic; astrology operates. Bacon was very desirous that
the church should avail itself of the guidance and aid of astrology;
and he feared the harm that Antichrist, whose advent
Bacon with many others of his century seems to have
believed was near at hand, or the Tartars with their astrologers,
would be able to do Christendom, if the church neglected
this art.<a id="FNanchor_2249" href="#Footnote_2249" class="fnanchor">[2249]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Unlikelihood
that
Bacon
was condemned
for magic
or astrology.</div>

<p>Having considered Bacon’s position in regard to magic
and astrology, we are now prepared to inquire what likelihood
there is that his reported condemnation in 1278 for
“some suspected novelties” was due to either. Briefly it may
be answered to begin with that his views concerning these
subjects were not novel; he shared them with Albert and
other contemporaries, and there seems to be no good reason
why they should have got him into trouble. His expressed
attitude towards “magic” is so hostile that it seems unlikely
that he would have been charged with it, when other clergymen
like Albert and William of Auvergne spoke of it with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_675">[Pg 675]</span>
less hostility and yet escaped unscathed. There is not a particle
of evidence in his works that he ever invoked spirits
or attempted to do anyone an injury by occult methods, and
this was the only kind of magic that was likely to be punished
at that time.<a id="FNanchor_2250" href="#Footnote_2250" class="fnanchor">[2250]</a> Towards astrology he was, it is true,
more favorable than some of his contemporaries. With his
views on astrological images and his attribution of religious
sects to conjunctions of the planets theologians like Aquinas
and William of Auvergne would refuse to agree, but Arabian
astrology supported such doctrines, and the views of an approved
Christian thinker like Albertus Magnus concerning
astrology are almost identical with those of Bacon. We note
elsewhere writings on such subjects as astrological medicine
by Franciscans; and such a regulation as that of May 25,
1292, for Franciscans studying at Paris, that they should
not spend the alms given them to buy books with for other
purposes, nor cause curious books to be made, suggests that
a number of them were prone to consult superstitious works
as well as that the Order forbids this.<a id="FNanchor_2251" href="#Footnote_2251" class="fnanchor">[2251]</a> And by “curious
books” are doubtless meant the sort that we have heard
Bacon strongly censure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Error of
Charles in
thinking
that any
stigma
rested on
Bacon’s
memory</div>

<p>Again therefore there is no reason why Bacon should
have been singled out for condemnation. Such a notion has
arisen partly from misapprehension as to the views of Bacon’s
contemporaries and from misstatements such as the
passage in Charles’ life of Bacon,<a id="FNanchor_2252" href="#Footnote_2252" class="fnanchor">[2252]</a> where he declares that
Cardinal Pierre d’Ailly in his treatise on laws and sects
condemns the doctrine of an English doctor concerning religions
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_676">[Pg 676]</span>
and the conjunctions of planets, and approves the
contrary doctrine of William of Auvergne, but “does not
dare” to name Bacon, to whom he alludes with the bated
breath of terror and repugnance. All this, except the bare
fact that d’Ailly criticizes this particular doctrine of Bacon,
is sheer fancy on Charles’ part. Had he consulted a complete
fifteenth-century edition of d’Ailly’s writings instead
of merely such of his treatises as were included in an
eighteenth-century edition of the works of Gerson, he would
have known that elsewhere the cardinal cites Bacon on astrology
by name with respect and admiration,<a id="FNanchor_2253" href="#Footnote_2253" class="fnanchor">[2253]</a> and that the
learned reformer even goes so far as to agree boldly and
explicitly with Bacon’s doctrine that Christ as a son of man
was under the stars.<a id="FNanchor_2254" href="#Footnote_2254" class="fnanchor">[2254]</a> That Bacon’s astrology had not been
condemned in 1278 is also indicated soon after his death by
Pierre Dubois’ approving mention of his discussion of the
utility of “mathematics.”<a id="FNanchor_2255" href="#Footnote_2255" class="fnanchor">[2255]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">But his
own statements
may
have
caused the
legend.</div>

<p>It must be added, however, that there are passages in
Bacon’s own writings which are perhaps also partly responsible
for the growth of the idea that he was condemned for
magic or astrology. Briefly, these are the passages where
he himself says that there is danger of scientists being accused
of magic. For instance, he tells us that “scarcely anyone
has dared” to speak of astronomical images in public,
“For those who are acquainted with them are immediately
called magicians, although really they are the wisest men.”<a id="FNanchor_2256" href="#Footnote_2256" class="fnanchor">[2256]</a>
It also seems somewhat strange that Bacon should always
be so condemnatory and contemptuous in his allusions to
magic and magicians, when both William of Auvergne and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_677">[Pg 677]</span>
Albertus Magnus allude to it as sometimes bordering upon
science, in which case they do not regard it unfavorably.
The suspicion occurs to one that Bacon perhaps protests a
little too much, that he is condemning magic from a fear that
he may be accused of it. But are not his apprehensions exaggerated?
Does he not overstate the hostility of canonists
and theologians to his many splendid sciences, and their tendency
to confuse them with magic? Thomas of Cantimpré
in the <i>De natura rerum</i> and Albert in the treatise on minerals
and in the <i>Speculum astronomiae</i> dared to discuss astronomical
images. And finally, whether there is any real
ground for Bacon’s apprehensions or not, if he is afraid of
being accused of magic, would not this very fear keep him
from going too far and from thereby incurring condemnation
in 1278 on this account?</p>

<h4>V. <i>Conclusion</i></h4>

<div class="sidenote">Characteristics
of
medieval
books.</div>

<p>Such were Roger Bacon’s views bearing upon magic and
experimental science and their relations to Christian thought,
as set forth principally in his <i>Opus Maius</i> and the two other
treatises to the pope which supplemented it. Most medieval
books impress one as literary mosaics where the method of
arrangement may be new but most of the fragments are familiar.
One soon recognizes, however, that striking similarity
in two passages is no sure sign that one is copied from
the other. The authors may have used the same Arabic
sources or simply be repeating some commonplace thought
of the times. Men began with the same assumptions and
general notions, read the same limited library, reasoned by
common methods, and naturally often reached the same conclusions,
especially since the field of knowledge was not yet
so extensive but that one man might try to cover it all, and
since all used the same medium of thought, the Latin
language. New discoveries were being made occasionally
but slowly, perhaps also sporadically and empirically. A
collection of industrial and chemical recipes in the thirteenth
century may in the main be derived from a set of the seventh
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_678">[Pg 678]</span>
century or Hellenistic age, but a few new ones have somehow
got added to the list in the interim. Thomas of Cantimpré’s
encyclopedia professes to be no more than a compilation,
but it seems to contain the first allusion we have to
modern plumbing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Features
of Bacon’s
<i>Opus
Maius</i>.</div>

<p>Bacon’s chief book was a mosaic like the rest, but bears
a strong impress of his personality. Sometimes there is too
much personality, but if we allow for this, we find it a valuable,
though not a complete nor perfect, picture of medieval
learning. Its ideas were not brand-new; it was not centuries
in advance of its age; but while its contents may be found
scattered in many other places, they will scarcely be found
altogether anywhere else, for it combines the most diverse
features. In the first place it is a “pious” production, if I
may employ that adjective in a somewhat objectionable
colloquial sense to indicate roughly a combination of religious,
theological, and moral points of view. In other
words, Bacon continues the Christian attitude of patristic
literature to a certain extent; and his book is written by a
clergyman for clergymen, and in order to promote the welfare
of the Church and Christianity. There is no denying
that, hail him as one may as a herald of modern science.
Secondly, he is frequently scholastic and metaphysical; yet
thirdly, is critical in numerous respects; and fourthly, insists
on practical utility as a standard by which science and
philosophy must be judged. Finally, he is an exponent of
the aims and methods of what we have called “the natural
magic and experimental school,” and as such he sometimes
comes near to being scientific. So there is no other book
quite like the <i>Opus Maius</i> in the Middle Ages, nor has there
been one like it since; yet it is true to its age and is still
readable to-day. It will therefore always remain one of the
most remarkable books of the remarkable thirteenth century.</p>

listed in <i>Opus Tertium</i>, Brewer,
15-17 (middle), would seem to
apply. In Brewer, 16, and Gasquet,
502, Bacon states that to get
money to meet the expenses incident
to the composition of his
work he had sent to his rich
brother in England, but received
no response because “exiles and
enemies of the king occupied the
land of my birth,” while his own
family had been exiled as supporters
of the crown and ruined
financially. All this must have
occurred before the arrival of the
second papal letter in 1266, for
Simon de Montfort had been
slain and the barons defeated in
1265.</p>

“Et impedimentorum remedia

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2054" href="#FNanchor_2054" class="label">[2054]</a> As Bacon himself states in the
<i>Opus Tertium</i>, Brewer, 7: “Primo
igitur in opere Secundo.”</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2055" href="#FNanchor_2055" class="label">[2055]</a> I cannot agree with Gasquet,
497, that it “is obvious from
numberless expressions in the
work itself” that the <i>Opus Maius</i>
was “addressed to the pope directly.”
The last chapter of the
first book in Bridges’s text is evidently
addressed to the pope, but
it is identical with a portion of
the <i>Opus Minus</i> and evidently
does not belong in the <i>Opus Maius</i>
and is not found in the two oldest
manuscripts. Similarly a passage
of some 16 pages in Bridges on
calendar reform, which gives the
present year as 1267, is practically
identical with a chapter of the
<i>Opus Tertium</i> and was evidently
transferred from that work to the
<i>Opus Maius</i> at some later date.
When we have excluded these
passages the work is surprisingly
free, compared to the other two
works, from passages suggesting
that it is addressed to the pope.
The one mention of the “Apostolic
See” (Bridges, I, 77; III, 94)
is impersonal and does not imply
that Foulques was pope, and does
not occur in one of the manuscripts.
Epithets such as “Your
Wisdom” (Bridges, I, 17, 23, 305),
“Your Highness” (I, 210; II,
377), “Your Glory” (I, 305; III,
96), “Your Reverence” (I, 376;
II, 219), “Your Holiness” (I, 81;
III, 101), “Your Beatitude” (I, 2,
72; III, 88) do not occur frequently
and are equally applicable
to a cardinal, or not found in all
the manuscripts, suggesting the
possibility of their having been
inserted later.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2056" href="#FNanchor_2056" class="label">[2056]</a> Such seems to me the most
plausible theory of the writing of
the three works and the one which
agrees best with Bacon’s own
statements; but it is only a hypothesis
from the printed texts
of his works which should be verified
by examination of the manuscripts.
Probably some of Bacon’s
statements can be interpreted
to conflict with this hypothesis,
but they sometimes conflict with
each other, and he could not even
keep the <i>scriptum principale</i> and
<i>Opus Maius</i> distinct in his own
mind according to Brewer’s text
(p. 3, “duo transmisi genera
scripturarum: quorum unum est
principale,” and p. 5, “principalis
scripturae,” whereas at p. 60 we
read, “Patet igitur quod scriptum
principale non potui mittere”).
See also Gasquet, p. 503,
and <i>Opus Tertium</i>, Brewer, p. 58.
I have been stimulated by but
cannot accept the conclusions of
Father Mandonnet’s “Roger Bacon
et la Composition des Trois
‘Opus’,” <i>Revue Néo-Scolastique</i>
(Louvain, 1913), pp. 52-68 and
164-180. Mandonnet holds that
the <i>Opus Maius</i> was written <i>after</i>
the other two works, which were
never finished nor sent, but from
which Roger took some passages
to insert in the <i>Opus Maius</i>, which
Mandonnet believes was sent only
in 1268.</p>

remedia circa illa, quae nuper esse
(occasione?) tanti discriminis intimasti:
et hoc quanto secretius
poteris facias indilate.” E. Jordan,
<i>Les Registres de Clement IV</i>,
etc., gives “<i>esse</i>,” which would
seem the correct reading rather
than the “<i>occasione</i>” of Martene
and Brewer. If one follows their
version, as I did in “The True
Roger Bacon,” 242-43, the passage
would have to be translated,
“What remedies you think should
be applied in those matters indicated
by you recently on so critical
an occasion.” But apparently there
was no such crisis.</p>

passage is the fourth one and in
it Bacon lists the three earlier
statements: “Scripsi in tribus locis
Vestre Glorie de huiusmodi secretis.”
Roger ultimately decides
that he will not reveal the whole
secret even in this fourth instalment,
because alchemists never
put the full truth into writing;
he therefore “reserves some
points for word of mouth.”</p>

<p class="h3sub">THE STUDY OF ROGER BACON</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lack of
early
printed
editions of
his works.</div>

<p>In addition to criticizing and refuting the over-estimate
of Roger Bacon which has been prevalent in modern times,
it may be well to indicate when and how this exaggerated
estimate of his importance and uniqueness originated, and
also to trace the gradual growth of a more critical attitude
towards him in still more recent years. The investigations
of Mr. A. G. Little and several other contributors
to the <i>Roger Bacon Essays</i> of 1914 have demonstrated that
his writings were not almost forgotten for centuries, but that
they exerted a continuous influence. However, owing perhaps
to the unfinished state and rather fragmentary, confused,
and scattered form in which they have survived in
the manuscripts, they did not appear, as did many of the
works of medieval science which we have considered, immediately
after the invention of printing in early editions.
No incunabula of them are known and only a few brief
treatises were printed in the course of the sixteenth century,<a id="FNanchor_2257" href="#Footnote_2257" class="fnanchor">[2257]</a>
namely, some alchemistic tracts of doubtful authorship, a
treatise on how to postpone the ills of old age, and the “Epistle
concerning the secret works of nature and the nullity of
magic,” which became quite a favorite and was reprinted
several times in Latin and appeared twice both in English
and in French translations in the course of the seventeenth
century.<a id="FNanchor_2258" href="#Footnote_2258" class="fnanchor">[2258]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">His popular
reputation
as a
magician.</div>

<p>Meanwhile, despite what was said of “the nullity of
magic” in this treatise on the secret works of nature,<a id="FNanchor_2259" href="#Footnote_2259" class="fnanchor">[2259]</a> Friar
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_680">[Pg 680]</span>
Bacon had become in popular tradition a nigromancer, conjurer,
and magician. As such he was presented about 1592
in Robert Greene’s play, the “Honourable History of Frier
Bacon and Frier Bungay,” with magic wand, perspective
glass, and speaking brazen head, and in the prose “Famous
Historie of Fryer Bacon” which appeared about the same
time.<a id="FNanchor_2260" href="#Footnote_2260" class="fnanchor">[2260]</a> In 1625 Naudé included Roger Bacon among the
great men of the past whose memory he endeavored to clear
of the false charge of magic.<a id="FNanchor_2261" href="#Footnote_2261" class="fnanchor">[2261]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Jebb’s
edition of
the <i>Opus
Maius</i>.</div>

<p>Other medical and alchemistic tracts by Bacon were issued
together in 1603,<a id="FNanchor_2262" href="#Footnote_2262" class="fnanchor">[2262]</a> and some portions of his chief work,
the <i>Opus Maius</i>, and other similar fragments dealing with
mathematics and optics were published in 1614.<a id="FNanchor_2263" href="#Footnote_2263" class="fnanchor">[2263]</a> But the
<i>Opus Maius</i> itself remained unprinted until 1733, when Jebb
issued his edition of the work upon which Bacon’s fame has
since largely rested. This edition,<a id="FNanchor_2264" href="#Footnote_2264" class="fnanchor">[2264]</a> although to-day become
quite rare, was perhaps just late enough not to share the neglect
which with the advance of modern science befell the
numerous earlier editions of medieval physicians, alchemists,
astrologers, and natural scientists. On the other hand it was
perhaps just early enough to introduce Roger and his criticisms
of the learning of his contemporaries to an age whose
historical interests were largely dominated by classicism.
And when interest in and study of the middle ages developed
in the course of the nineteenth century, for a time it had the
effect of only increasing the exaggerated emphasis laid upon
Roger Bacon.</p>

<div class="sidenote">General
misestimate
of
Bacon
and of
medieval
science.</div>

<p>As a result it came to be the fashion in works tracing the
history of this or that department of learning from the times
of the ancient Greeks or Egyptians to our own, in gliding
rapidly and at a lofty height over the generally unexplored
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_681">[Pg 681]</span>
medieval region, and airily dropping a few bombs concerning
the blighting effect of the church upon freedom of
thought and scientific investigation or anent the inanities of
scholasticism, to exclaim at the marvelous apparition of a
mind like Roger Bacon’s in such an age and to hail him as a
herald of a later and better civilization. There was the
more excuse for doing this, since Jebb’s version of the <i>Opus
Maius</i> had terminated the text with the sixth part on “Experimental
Science.”<a id="FNanchor_2265" href="#Footnote_2265" class="fnanchor">[2265]</a> This theme thus appeared to be the
climax of the work, and the impression was given that Roger
Bacon was primarily a natural scientist and that he regarded
experimental method as the supreme thing in the study of
nature. Consequently he came to be regarded by many as
the first rebel against scholasticism and the first prophet of
modern science.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Roger
Bacon and
Francis
Bacon.</div>

<p>The fact that his name was Bacon also contributed to
Roger’s celebrity, as Francis Bacon was already a favorite
with historians of science and thought, and it now appeared
that he had borrowed some of his ideas from, or had at least
been anteceded in them by, the thirteenth century friar. Both
had criticized scholastic method and urged the great practical
utility possible from applied science. Akin to the idols
of Francis were Roger’s four causes of human error. The
program of endowed scientific research&mdash;based upon an essentially
medieval classification of science and list of anticipated
inventions&mdash;in which Francis tried to interest the
society of his time in his <i>New Atlantis</i><a id="FNanchor_2266" href="#Footnote_2266" class="fnanchor">[2266]</a> has a general resemblance
to the attempt of Roger to enlist the support of the
pope in the cause of science in his <i>Opus Maius</i>; while the
“Workes of Nature, Works of Art” of the <i>New Atlantis</i>,
which made that isle almost seem “a Land of Magicians,”<a id="FNanchor_2267" href="#Footnote_2267" class="fnanchor">[2267]</a>
are rather suggestive of the treatise, “Of the Secret Works
of Art and Nature and the Nullity of Magic,” by Roger
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_682">[Pg 682]</span>
Bacon to whom indeed Francis seems to allude in the <i>New
Atlantis</i> as “Your Monke that was the Inuentour of Ordnance,
and of Gunpowder.”<a id="FNanchor_2268" href="#Footnote_2268" class="fnanchor">[2268]</a> Roger was by some indeed
not only regarded as superior to Francis Bacon in priority,
but in having emphasized the importance in scientific investigation
of mathematical method whose value Francis had
failed to appreciate.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Legend of
his martyrdom
for
science.</div>

<p>The next step in the development of the Baconian legend
was to supply Roger with a biography suited to his supposed
position as a modern experimental and mathematical scientist
in the midst of an age of religious bigotry and superstition,
of gloomy monks and arid theologians. Surely, especially
in view of his later literary and popular renown as a
magician, he must have been persecuted and a martyr to
science. Abbé Feret has shown how through the nineteenth
century successive historians kept adding to the legend of
Friar Bacon’s persecution by the Franciscan Order without
giving any references to the sources for the details which
they elaborated from their own imaginations.
<a id="FNanchor_2269" href="#Footnote_2269" class="fnanchor">[2269]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Works of
Brewer
and
Charles.</div>

<p>The sources, however, became more accessible with the
editing in 1859 in the Rolls Series by Brewer of a number
of Bacon’s minor treatises hitherto unpublished. Brewer,
however, was able from the manuscripts at his disposal, to
present only an incomplete text of the <i>Opus Minus</i>, <i>Opus
Tertium</i>, and <i>Compendium Studii Philosophiae</i>. These
served nevertheless to give a new stimulus to the interest in
and the study of Bacon, especially since two years later appeared
Charles’ book on Roger Bacon where were included
further extracts from his unpublished writings. Unfortunately
Charles wrote without knowledge of Brewer’s labors,<a id="FNanchor_2270" href="#Footnote_2270" class="fnanchor">[2270]</a>
and it must be added that several writers on Bacon since have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_683">[Pg 683]</span>
failed to keep abreast with the latest research in the field.<a id="FNanchor_2271" href="#Footnote_2271" class="fnanchor">[2271]</a>
Charles also was guilty, as Abbé Feret has shown, of swelling
the story of Bacon’s imprisonments, and in other matters
he jumped to conclusions unwarranted by the sources or indulged
in undiluted imagination.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Minor
studies of
the later
nineteenth
century.</div>

<p>The works of Brewer and Charles educed a number of
minor essays and studies in the following decades. Two unsigned
articles on “The life and writings of Roger Bacon”
and “The philosophy of Roger Bacon” which appeared in
<i>The Westminster Review</i> in 1864, are worth noting as combining
a tendency towards a sane and critical estimate of
what Bacon had actually said and accomplished, with the inclination
to regard him as a voice crying in the wilderness
of medieval scholasticism and theology. The writer admitted
that the merit of the <i>Opus Maius</i> “lies rather in the
spirit in which it was written than in the facts it records or
in any merit which it may have as a scientific whole.” He
further asserted that “it can easily be shown that of the
things which Bacon is asserted to have invented, several were
perfectly well known before his time, and the rest are nowhere
described in his works.” The writer also cited some
of Roger’s absurd experiments, and said, “Notwithstanding
his forcible language about the prerogatives of experimental
science and his bitter invective against frail authority, we
find him occasionally resting on authority with childlike
faith, and treating his favorite science as if its only prerogative
was to provoke a smile.” Yet he still maintained that
“Bacon preached a philosophy of which not half-a-dozen
men in Europe saw the value, and of which the majority of
really good men feared the results,” and that “when Roger
Bacon was laid in his grave, the real philosophy was buried
with him.”<a id="FNanchor_2272" href="#Footnote_2272" class="fnanchor">[2272]</a> Many of the articles which appeared in the
years following were of slight value, causing G. Delorme
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_684">[Pg 684]</span>
to say in 1910, “Monographs or studies concerning Bacon
are numerous, perhaps too numerous.”<a id="FNanchor_2273" href="#Footnote_2273" class="fnanchor">[2273]</a> As he proceeded
to explain, in many of them Bacon was misunderstood and
misinterpreted, so that they must be read with the greatest
caution. On the other hand, in 1891 had appeared Abbé
Feret’s valuable criticism of the legends regarding Bacon’s
imprisonments.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Recent
editions
of Bacon’s
works.</div>

<p>Next came solid progress in additions to the catalogue of
Roger’s works and fragments by recent discoveries in the
manuscripts, and in new or first editions of a number of his
previously known writings. In 1897 J. H. Bridges’ fuller,
handier, and more correctly arranged two volume edition of
the <i>Opus Maius</i> replaced Jebb’s now extremely rare edition.
Unfortunately, while supplied with a helpful introduction,
analytical table of contents, and footnotes, this new version
was so full of misreadings of the manuscripts and other
mistakes in the text due to an imperfect knowledge of Latin,
that in 1900 a third and supplementary volume of corrections
was added to it. In 1897 Cardinal (then Father) Gasquet
discovered and published a new fragment, which he regarded
as an introduction to the <i>Opus Maius</i>, but which seems to me
evidently the first part of the <i>Opus Minus</i>, as Mr. Little has
already suggested.<a id="FNanchor_2274" href="#Footnote_2274" class="fnanchor">[2274]</a> Passages in this fragment serve to render
even more untenable the story of Roger’s persecution
before 1267. In 1902 Nolan and Hirsch edited Bacon’s
Greek Grammar. Then in 1909 Professor Duhem gave to
the world a newly discovered fragment of the <i>Opus Tertium</i>;
while in 1911 the British Society of Franciscan Studies
printed the <i>Compendium Studii Theologiae</i>, edited by Canon
(now Dean) Hastings Rashdall, and in 1912 more of the
<i>Opus Tertium</i>, edited by Mr. A. G. Little. Meanwhile Robert
Steele, who in 1905 had edited a fragment of Bacon’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_685">[Pg 685]</span>
<i>Metaphysics</i>, began in 1912 to produce the <i>Communia
Naturalium</i> in sections. Other scholars had announced new
or first editions of other treatises, mathematical, medical or
alchemistic, as in preparation, and the discovery of a complete
copy of the <i>Metaphysics</i> in the Vatican Library had
just been announced when the world war broke out and temporarily
stayed their publication.<a id="FNanchor_2275" href="#Footnote_2275" class="fnanchor">[2275]</a> Recently, however, Mr.
Steele has published another volume containing Bacon’s introduction
to and version of <i>The Secret of Secrets</i>, in the
preface of which he says: “Medieval students will be glad
to learn that the publication of the whole of Bacon’s work
now seems assured.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Continued
over-estimate
of
Bacon.</div>

<p>As Bacon’s works thus became more generally known
and as standards of historical criticism grew more strict,
not only the facts of his life, but his doctrines, point of view,
and personal equation were more carefully examined and
analyzed, and previous exaggerated estimates of him were
questioned or toned down, although still repeated in some
quarters. Indeed, the very writer who rejects some one
legend may hold fast to the old view of Bacon in other respects.
Especially hard to down has been the notion that
Roger Bacon stood almost alone in the middle ages in his
advocacy of natural science. Such was still the impression
given by otherwise excellent recent estimates of Bacon, such
as those in the Catholic Encyclopedia and in Henry Osborn
Taylor’s <i>The Medieval Mind</i>,<a id="FNanchor_2276" href="#Footnote_2276" class="fnanchor">[2276]</a> and such was still the frame
of mind in which preparations were made at more than one
great university to celebrate in 1914 the seventh centennial
of his birth&mdash;preparations which resulted at Oxford in the
publication of an important volume of commemoration essays
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_686">[Pg 686]</span>
by fourteen scholars from various lands and fields of
learning, five of whom were editors of Bacon’s writings,
while others had previously published books or articles concerning
him, and still others were authors of general histories
of the department of learning to which they were now
to estimate Bacon’s contributions or relation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Beginnings
of
adverse
criticism.</div>

<p>Already, however, before the appearance of this volume
Roger Bacon’s pre-eminence and superiority to his times had
been questioned from more than one quarter. Father Mandonnet
in his work on Siger de Brabant and Latin Averroism
affirmed that Bacon’s importance had been over-estimated
in many ways. While Charles had held that, if Bacon’s
scientific worth had been exaggerated, his value as a school-man
had been lost sight of, Mandonnet declared that as a philosopher
and theologian he was behind rather than in the
forefront of his age.<a id="FNanchor_2277" href="#Footnote_2277" class="fnanchor">[2277]</a> Rashdall had asserted in 1911 that
“Bacon was more the child of his age than he imagined himself
to be.”<a id="FNanchor_2278" href="#Footnote_2278" class="fnanchor">[2278]</a> W. H. V. Reade in the <i>English Historical Review</i>
for October, 1912,<a id="FNanchor_2279" href="#Footnote_2279" class="fnanchor">[2279]</a> hoped “that it is not an article of
faith with the Society of Franciscan Studies to accept all of
Roger Bacon’s statements. As regards the state of knowledge
among his contemporaries, his assertions are often of
no greater value than the similar assertions of his distinguished
namesake in a later age.” The next year Mr. Reade
spoke in the same periodical of “the usual Baconian atmosphere,
in which science and superstition are happily or unhappily
compounded.”<a id="FNanchor_2280" href="#Footnote_2280" class="fnanchor">[2280]</a> In May, 1914, in my paper on
“Roger Bacon and Experimental Method in the Middle
Ages,”<a id="FNanchor_2281" href="#Footnote_2281" class="fnanchor">[2281]</a> I discussed what his “experimental science” really
amounted to, and showed that it was representative of the
science of his time rather than in revolt against it.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The
Commemoration
Essays.</i></div>

<p>When the Oxford <i>Roger Bacon Essays</i> appeared, many
of them were marked by a sane and critical attitude, were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_687">[Pg 687]</span>
restrained and scientific in tone, and did not indulge in
glowing but unsubstantiated eulogies of the noted friar.
Professor David Eugene Smith gave warning that “one is
liable to be led away by enthusiasm, when writing upon the
occasion of the seven hundredth anniversary of any great
leader, to read into his works what is not there, and to ascribe
to him abilities which he never possessed.”<a id="FNanchor_2282" href="#Footnote_2282" class="fnanchor">[2282]</a> But this
tendency both he and most of his fellow essayists successfully
resisted, and the main achievement of the volume was to
point out Roger’s indebtedness to others for some of the
ideas upon which his fame has rested and to note his mistakes
and superstitions, rather than to bring to light anything
new to his credit.<a id="FNanchor_2283" href="#Footnote_2283" class="fnanchor">[2283]</a> It became evident that a careful
examination of those treatises by Bacon which had been recently
edited or were in preparation for publication, and of
those which have recently been brought to light in manuscript
form or are still difficult of access in old editions, was
unlikely to add much to his stock of ideas as found in the
now well-known <i>Opus Maius</i>, <i>Opus Minus</i> and <i>Opus Tertium</i>.</p>

</div>

<p class="h3sub">ROGER BACON AND GUNPOWDER</p>

<p>In his paper “Roger Bacon and Gunpowder” contributed
to the <i>Roger Bacon Commemoration Essays</i>, Colonel Hime
tries to prove Roger Bacon the inventor of gunpowder by
the method employed to prove Francis Bacon the author of
Shakespeare’s plays&mdash;a cipher. Since other contributors to
the same volume refer favorably to this effort (Mr. A. G.
Little, p. 395, calls it an “ingenious explanation” and Mr.
Patterson Muir, p. 301, says that “Colonel Hime establishes
a large probability” in its favor) it may be well to note some
points against it quite apart from the merits of the cipher
itself.</p>

<p>In the first place, the cipher is based upon chapters of
the <i>Epistola de secretis operibus naturae et de nullitate
magiae</i> not found in the early manuscript of that work and
considered doubtful by Charles in his work on Roger Bacon.
Indeed, the opening phrases of two chapters “Transactis annis
Arabum sexcentis et duobus,” and “Annis Arabum 630
transactis” suggest their source.</p>

<p>Secondly, Roger Bacon openly alludes to gunpowder in
1267 in his <i>Opus Tertium</i> as already in common use in
children’s toy explosives. Therefore Colonel Hime has to
date the <i>De secretis</i> in 1248, and to hold that Bacon was at
that time “driven to employ cryptic methods by fear of the
Inquisition” (p. 334), but that by 1267 “Circumstances
had totally changed in the lapse of years; the composition
of gunpowder ... had been divulged, and the first use
made of the deadly mixture was for the amusement of children”
(p. 321). This transition from fear of the inquisition
to child’s play might seem in itself a sufficient <i>reductio
ad absurdum</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_689">[Pg 689]</span></p>

<p>But is there any good reason for dating the <i>De secretis</i> in
1248? Much of it sounds like a brief popular compilation
from Bacon’s three works of 1266-7 concocted by some one
else later; compare, for instance, the first paragraph of the
sixth chapter of the <i>De secretis</i> with Duhem, <i>Un fragment
inédit de l’Opus Tertium</i>, 153-4, and Little, <i>Part of the Opus
Tertium</i>, 50-51. Charles considered the last five chapters to
be of dubious authenticity, and they are not found in the
oldest manuscript of the thirteenth century. The dedication
of the <i>De secretis</i> to William, bishop of Paris, who died in
1249, occurs first in the late edition of 1618 and has not
been found by Little in any manuscript.</p>

<p>Then the inquisition bug-a-boo is negligible. Has any
one ever shown that the inquisition punished a practical invention?
It was not for having invented the telescope that
Galileo was persecuted. Moreover, Galileo’s was an exceptional
case, and it can not be shown that in the thirteenth century
the church persecuted men of science. Rather, popes
and prelates were their patrons. Finally the inquisition
seems to have been set up in England on only one occasion
during the middle ages.</p>

<p>But even if we admit that Bacon wrote the <i>De secretis</i>
as we have it in 1248 and was at that time afraid of the
Inquisition, the question remains: why in 1267-8, when
mentioning the explosive in those works in which he made
such desperate efforts to secure the pope as his patron, and
boasted repeatedly of his own superiority to his contemporaries,
did he not claim the credit of the invention which he
had set forth in cipher twenty years before? The simple
answer is: it was not his invention.</p>

<p>One instance must be added to show how Colonel Hime
misinterprets the text of the <i>De secretis</i> in his eagerness
to smell powder everywhere. He writes (p. 324): “Now,
towards the end of Chap. X., Bacon speaks without disguise
of charcoal under the name of the wood from which it is
made, and mentions the two trees, hazel and willow, which
give the best. He significantly adds that when charcoal is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_690">[Pg 690]</span>
added to proper proportions of certain other substances,
something noteworthy happens. Since, then, charcoal is
one of the subjects of these two chapters, it becomes all the
more probable that saltpeter forms another.” In a note
Hime adds the Latin of the passage in question: <i>Si vero
partes virgulti coryli aut salicis multarum justa rerum serie
apte ordinaveris, unionem naturalem servabunt: et hoc non
tradas oblivioni, quia valet ad multa</i>.</p>

<p>Let us note first that these last words do not mean,
“something noteworthy happens,” but “don’t forget this, because
it’s valuable.” Thus the true wording does not in the
least suggest an explosion, as Colonel Hime’s translation
does. Rather it suggests if anything the phraseology of mystical
and magical works generally, like the closing words of
Thebit ben Corat’s treatise on Images, <i>Intellige quod exposui
tibi, et si queris ordinem invenies effectum ne dubites</i>.
(Bodleian MS 463, fol. 77v, Explicit.) Secondly, the
words <i>partes virgulti coryli aut salicis</i> probably do not denote
charcoal but twigs or rods of hazel or willow, as they
do in Bacon’s account of the experiment performed by magicians
with a split hazel rod. It occurs both in the <i>Opus
Maius</i> (Bridges, II, 219) and <i>Opus Tertium</i> (Little, 49-50;
Duhem, 153); I quote the latter. <i>Unde magici accipiunt
virgas coruli et salicum, et dividunt eas secundum longitudinem,
et faciunt eas distare secundum quantitatem palmae, et
addunt carmina sua, et coniungunt partes divise; sed non
propter carmina, sed ex naturali proprietate.</i> (Wherefore
magicians take rods of hazel and willow, and divide them
lengthwise, and hold them the breadth of a palm apart, and
add their charms, and the divided parts come together; but
not on account of the charms, but from their very natures.)
Moreover, we have already heard this matter of the split
hazel rod discussed by William of Auvergne, and noted that
it was repeated by Albertus Magnus and John of St.
Amand, a medieval writer about 1261, as well as by Bacon.</p>

<p>Thirdly, it is probably precisely this hazel-rod experiment
to which the writer of the passage quoted by Hime refers.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_691">[Pg 691]</span>
<i>Multarum justa rerum serie ordinaveris</i> seems a hurried
equivalent for the more specific directions in the passages in
the <i>Opus Maius</i> and <i>Opus Tertium</i>, and this bears out what
I have already suggested, that the <i>De secretis</i> may be in part
at least a brief popular compilation from Bacon’s other
works. Finally, the phrase <i>unionem naturalem servabunt</i>
applies better to the bending together in the middle of two
halves of a split hazel rod held apart at the ends than it does
to a mixture of saltpeter, charcoal and sulphur.</p>

<p>And now what becomes of Colonel Hime’s assertion,
“Since therefore charcoal is one of the subjects of these
two chapters, it becomes all the more probable that saltpeter
forms another?” We may alter it to read thus: since charcoal
is not a subject of either of these chapters, it becomes all
the more improbable that a method of refining saltpeter is
disclosed in them in cipher.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Who was
its author?</div>

<p>The <i>Speculum astronomiae</i><a id="FNanchor_2284" href="#Footnote_2284" class="fnanchor">[2284]</a> has been reserved for separate
treatment, partly because it seems to be one of the most important
single treatises in the history of medieval astrology,
and partly because the traditional ascription of it to Albertus
Magnus has been recently questioned and the attempt made
to attribute it to Roger Bacon.<a id="FNanchor_2285" href="#Footnote_2285" class="fnanchor">[2285]</a> This attempt has been supported
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_693">[Pg 693]</span>
by so little in the way of real evidence for a Baconian
authorship that it might be passed by, were it not for the
fact that, as sensational assertions concerning either Roger
or Francis Bacon are apt to do, it has attracted widespread
attention and been unquestioningly accepted by other students
of Roger Bacon.<a id="FNanchor_2286" href="#Footnote_2286" class="fnanchor">[2286]</a> Father Mandonnet adduced no manuscript
evidence in favor of Bacon’s authorship and Gabriel
Naudé in the seventeenth century was the first person to
suggest it.<a id="FNanchor_2287" href="#Footnote_2287" class="fnanchor">[2287]</a> Mandonnet’s argument for the Baconian authorship
reduces simply to this, that the views expressed in
the work are Bacon’s rather than Albert’s and that the writing
of the <i>Speculum astronomiae</i> could be fitted better into
Roger’s career.<a id="FNanchor_2288" href="#Footnote_2288" class="fnanchor">[2288]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Points in
favor of
Albert as
its author.</div>

<p>We shall show, on the contrary, that the <i>Speculum</i> is
regularly ascribed to Albertus Magnus in the medieval manuscripts
and in bibliographies by learned writers of the fourteenth
and fifteenth centuries, as well as by most students of
Albertus Magnus or of thirteenth century learning since
then.<a id="FNanchor_2289" href="#Footnote_2289" class="fnanchor">[2289]</a> The Latin style and the method of presentation
adopted in the <i>Speculum</i> also more closely resemble Albert’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_694">[Pg 694]</span>
style and method than they do Bacon’s.<a id="FNanchor_2290" href="#Footnote_2290" class="fnanchor">[2290]</a> It has already been
demonstrated that Mandonnet was grossly in error in representing
Albert as an unqualified opponent of judicial astrology,
and our coming examination of the <i>Speculum astronomiae</i>
will show that on most points its attitude to astrology
is the same as that of Albert, on some points even
more conservative than his, and on only one point less so and
more like Bacon’s attitude. In the attitude of the <i>Speculum</i>
toward other forms of magic or occult sciences than astrology
we shall find a closer approximation to the Albertine
than to the Baconian view-point, and also some internal textual
evidence which strongly supports the Albertine authorship.
Finally we shall argue that, if it is true that the <i>Speculum</i>
had some connection with the condemnation at Paris
in 1277 of 219 opinions attributed to Siger of Brabant, it
may have been written for that occasion by Albert as appropriately
as by Bacon. And we shall note some of the
opinions condemned on that occasion as constituting, with
the <i>Speculum</i> itself, valuable evidence concerning the relations
existing between theology and astrology in the second
half of the thirteenth century.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Testimony
of medieval
manuscripts
and
authors.</div>

<p>In so far as I have examined notices of manuscripts of
the <i>Speculum astronomiae</i> in the catalogues or the manuscripts
themselves, I have found it in no case attributed to
Roger Bacon and regularly ascribed to Albertus Magnus, as
the list of manuscripts given in the appendix at the close of
this chapter will show. In one or two cases another hand
than that in which the text of the <i>Speculum</i> is written has
suggested “master Philip, chancellor of Paris,” as author instead
of Albert, but otherwise the manuscripts support the
Albertine authorship. The <i>Speculum</i> is cited as Albert’s in
a fourteenth century manuscript.<a id="FNanchor_2291" href="#Footnote_2291" class="fnanchor">[2291]</a> Also the list of writings
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_695">[Pg 695]</span>
by Dominicans drawn up before the middle of the fourteenth
century ascribed to Albert both a <i>Contra librum nigromanticorum</i>
and a <i>Speculum astrobium</i> (or <i>astralabicum</i>).<a id="FNanchor_2292" href="#Footnote_2292" class="fnanchor">[2292]</a> Later
in the same century a contemporary of Thomas of Pisa
or Bologna, physician and astrologer to Charles V the Wise
of France, 1364-1380, cites “Albert the commentator in his
Mirror.”<a id="FNanchor_2293" href="#Footnote_2293" class="fnanchor">[2293]</a> In 1412 Amplonius in the catalogue of his
manuscripts which he wrote with his own hand lists both a
<i>Speculum mathematicum Alberti Magni</i> and a <i>Speculum
domini Alberti de libris mathematicis</i>;<a id="FNanchor_2294" href="#Footnote_2294" class="fnanchor">[2294]</a> and Schum’s modern
catalogue of the Amplonian collection at Erfurt lists
three manuscripts of the <i>Speculum astronomiae</i> of the fourteenth
century and in every case ascribes it to Albert.<a id="FNanchor_2295" href="#Footnote_2295" class="fnanchor">[2295]</a> Early
in the fifteenth century also Cardinal Pierre d’Ailly more
than once cited the <i>Speculum</i> as by Albert,<a id="FNanchor_2296" href="#Footnote_2296" class="fnanchor">[2296]</a>, as did Gerson
and Nicholas of Denmark in the same century.<a id="FNanchor_2297" href="#Footnote_2297" class="fnanchor">[2297]</a> Pignon
and Valleoletanus also ascribed it to Albert in their catalogues
of the writings of Dominicans.<a id="FNanchor_2298" href="#Footnote_2298" class="fnanchor">[2298]</a> At the close of the
fifteenth century Pico della Mirandola in his work against
astrology was almost the first to question Albert’s authorship,
which he did in an effort to weaken the reliance of
the adherents of astrology upon the authority of Albert as
a defender of that art.<a id="FNanchor_2299" href="#Footnote_2299" class="fnanchor">[2299]</a> Pico apparently did not possess a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_696">[Pg 696]</span>
sufficiently extensive knowledge of Albert’s other writings
to pass upon the question of the authenticity of the <i>Speculum</i>,
or he would not have imagined that by questioning the
Albertine authorship of it, he could prevent the adherents
of astrology from citing numerous passages in Albert’s
works in favor of their art. But now as to the astrological
doctrine of the <i>Speculum</i> itself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Occasion
for writing
the
<i>Speculum</i>.</div>

<p>The <i>Proemium</i> or opening chapter of the <i>Speculum
astronomiae</i>, or <i>Mirror of Astrology</i>, states the occasion for
writing it, namely, the existence of certain works hostile
to Christianity, many of which are actually concerned with
necromancy but make false profession of astronomy or
astrology. On this account “some great men” have censured
other books which may be quite harmless, and noble
volumes of astronomy have been brought under suspicion
and into disrepute. Therefore the writer, who describes
himself vaguely as a devotee both of the Faith and of
Philosophy, has made a critical bibliography of both kinds
of works, giving their authors’ names, their titles, opening
words, and a general notion of their contents.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Defense
of astronomy.</div>

<p>In the next chapter the author takes up books which
we should regard as purely astronomical, and says that if
these were to be suppressed, “a great and truly noble part
of philosophy would be buried for a time at least, until
owing to saner counsels it should rise again.” He adds
that those who have read these books know that there is
not a single word in them which is, or even appears to be,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_697">[Pg 697]</span>
against the Catholic Faith, and that it is not fair for those
to judge them who have never even handled them.<a id="FNanchor_2300" href="#Footnote_2300" class="fnanchor">[2300]</a> Thus
the writer seems to think that there is some danger of an
attack upon even the study of astronomy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">And of
judicial
astrology.</div>

<p>The author’s main concern, however, is with judicial
astrology, which in the third chapter he distinguishes from
astronomy proper as “the science of judgments of the stars.”
Of it, too, he speaks in high terms of praise. He declares
that it turns man’s thoughts toward God, revealing as it
does the great Source of all things. Furthermore, it is the
bond between natural philosophy and mathematics. “For
if the most high God in His Supreme wisdom so ordained
this world that He, who is the living God of a lifeless
heaven, wills to work in created things which are found in
these four inferior elements through deaf and dumb stars
as instruments, and if concerning these we have one science,
namely, mathematics which teaches us in things caused to
consider their Creator, and another natural science which
teaches us to find by experience in created things the Creator
of creatures; what is more desirable for the investigator than
to have a third science to instruct him how this and that
change of things mundane is brought to pass by the change
of things celestial?”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The stars
do not
possess
senses or
reason.</div>

<p>It will be noted that the author of the <i>Speculum</i> regards
the stars as “deaf and dumb” and the heaven as inanimate.
In a later chapter<a id="FNanchor_2301" href="#Footnote_2301" class="fnanchor">[2301]</a> he condemns as “most evidently meriting
censure” the assertion made by Albumasar, apparently upon
Aristotle’s authority, that “the planets themselves are animated
by a rational soul.” For him the stars are mere divine
instruments, deaf to would-be worshipers of them, and too
dumb&mdash;one would infer&mdash;to produce the music of the
spheres.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Subdivisions
of astrology.</div>

<p>The fourth chapter of the <i>Speculum</i> speaks of the four
familiar sub-divisions of judicial astrology, namely, revolutions,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_698">[Pg 698]</span>
nativities, interrogations, and elections. To the last
is annexed the science of images, which the author regards
as the acme or climax of “astronomy,” but with which he
admits are associated those necromantic books of evil repute
which he proposes carefully to distinguish from the others.
This at once reminds us of the passages in Albert’s <i>Minerals</i>
where he spoke of the connection between such images engraved
on stones and necromancy, but where his associates
were curious to know the doctrine of images none the less,
and he affirmed that it was good doctrine. Now, after the
fifth chapter, which may be described as a statement of
astrological theory and technique in a nutshell, he takes up
judicial astrology and its several sub-divisions in further
successive chapters,<a id="FNanchor_2302" href="#Footnote_2302" class="fnanchor">[2302]</a> defining the field and describing the
literature. A majority of the books listed, good as well
as bad, appear to be Latin translations from the Arabic.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Evil
images.</div>

<p>Of images the author describes three varieties, the first
two of which he severely condemns. The first kind is
abominable, including the images of Toz Graecus and Germath
of Babylon, those connected with the worship of
Venus, and those of Belenus and Hermes. These are exorcized
by the names of fifty-four<a id="FNanchor_2303" href="#Footnote_2303" class="fnanchor">[2303]</a> angels who are said to
serve in the circle of the moon,<a id="FNanchor_2304" href="#Footnote_2304" class="fnanchor">[2304]</a> but are probably really the
names of demons. The names of seven are engraved forwards
to procure a good result and backwards in order to
ward off evil fortune. Suffumigations also are made with
aloes, saffron, and balsam to achieve a good result, with
other woods for evil ends. The author explains that the
spirits are not truly coerced by such things, but sometimes
God allows them to pretend to be, in order to deceive sinful
men. The practices associated with this first kind of images
he censures as the worst sort of idolatry, although their practitioners,
in order to retain something worthy of belief, observe
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_699">[Pg 699]</span>
the twenty-eight mansions of the moon and other
seasons.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A second
variety.</div>

<p>The second variety of images is a little less improper,
but still detestable. In it certain names are exorcized by
the inscription of characters. Such are the four rings of
Solomon and the nine candelabra and the three figures of
spirits who are called the princes of the four quarters of
the world, and the Almandel of Solomon, the seven names
from the book <i>Uraharum</i>,<a id="FNanchor_2305" href="#Footnote_2305" class="fnanchor">[2305]</a> the fifteen from <i>The Institutes
of Raziel</i>, and so on. “Far from us be this sort also,” says
our author, “for it is open to the suspicion that beneath
the names in unknown tongues may lie hidden something
contrary to the purity of the Catholic Faith.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Good
astronomical
images.</div>

<p>The third variety of images, in which the author sees
no harm but much good, and which he has called “the
sublimest part of astronomy,”<a id="FNanchor_2306" href="#Footnote_2306" class="fnanchor">[2306]</a> are purely astronomical
images which derive their virtue from the configurations of
the sky but admit no other inscription of characters, and
neither exorcisms, invocations, nor suffumigations.<a id="FNanchor_2307" href="#Footnote_2307" class="fnanchor">[2307]</a> In a
later chapter,<a id="FNanchor_2308" href="#Footnote_2308" class="fnanchor">[2308]</a> however, he permits in addition to astronomical
figures and symbols the engraving of certain simple
words and images of objects of obvious meaning, such as a
scorpion and the word <i>Destruatur</i> upon an image intended
to drive scorpions away.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The question

free will.</div>

<p>Meanwhile, between these two chapters upon astronomical
images, the author returns in four chapters to the other
sub-divisions of astrology, mainly with the purpose of investigating
whether revolutions, nativities, interrogations,
and elections are incompatible with freedom of the human
will,&mdash;a question upon which he has already touched a little
in previous chapters. He maintains the usual position that
the celestial influences make impressions according to the
fitness of matter to receive them, and that man by using his
intellect can to a considerable degree be master of his fate.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_700">[Pg 700]</span>
As usual he cites Ptolemy’s <i>dictum</i> that “the astrologer can
avert much evil from the operation of the stars, if he knows
the nature of the influence to be exerted upon him and can
prepare himself beforehand to receive it.”<a id="FNanchor_2309" href="#Footnote_2309" class="fnanchor">[2309]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">And
elections.</div>

<p>Therefore the author regards election of favorable hours
as an admission alike of freedom of the will and of astrological
influence, and affirms that “in entering upon great
undertakings, it is rashness, not freedom of the will, to
despise election of the hour.”<a id="FNanchor_2310" href="#Footnote_2310" class="fnanchor">[2310]</a> Moreover, he asserts that
“all philosophers are agreed in this, that when we know the
hour of impregnation of any woman, we thereby know the
history of the foetus until it breathes and comes forth from
the womb and until death.”<a id="FNanchor_2311" href="#Footnote_2311" class="fnanchor">[2311]</a> Hence one should choose the
moment of conception as carefully as the hour for a surgical
operation,&mdash;a passage paralleled by Albert’s account elsewhere
of the care exercised by Nectanebus as to the hour
of his intercourse with Olympias.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Free will
and
nativities.</div>

<p>Despite what he has just said about tracing the history
of the foetus until death, the author regards the doctrine of
nativities as in large measure inconsistent with freedom
of the will.<a id="FNanchor_2312" href="#Footnote_2312" class="fnanchor">[2312]</a> After the mental and moral faculties have
sufficiently developed, he believes in freedom of choice, and
so holds that the casting of horoscopes, especially in regard
to moral characteristics, infringes upon free will. Even
when such a matter as length of life is predicted from the
constellations for an individual, he contends that it does not
mean that one must live that long, but that one’s natural
term of life cannot be prolonged beyond that point.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Revolutions.</div>

<p>The author seems to think that the human will has
very little control over revolutions, by which “is indicated
what God, the glorious, will accomplish in a given year
through the stars as His instruments” for states and peoples;
in other words, such general events as harvests, wars,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_701">[Pg 701]</span>
earthquakes, floods, and terrible prodigies. Events signified
by comets come under this head also. All such events the
author seems to regard as divinely ordered and he cites
Ptolemy and Albumasar to the effect that God’s plans are
not changeable like those of children or servants.<a id="FNanchor_2313" href="#Footnote_2313" class="fnanchor">[2313]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Interrogations.</div>

<p>As for the practice of interrogations, the author affirms
that to inquire of the stars what course of action one should
pursue “does not destroy, but rather rectifies free will.”
Some questions asked of astrologers, nevertheless, are very
difficult to reconcile with free will, for example, the question
whether another person will answer one’s request. If
an astrologer is able to answer such a question beforehand,
it seems to indicate that the other person has no freedom
in the matter. After some juggling with the terms, “necessity”
and “possibility,” the author thinks that he has found
a mode of reconciliation in “the compossibility of free will
with divine providence,” since with the latter he identifies
the significations of the stars, and “God knew from eternity
which course the man would choose.” Our author hastens to
add, however, that God may wish to conceal some things
from us, and that he will not assert that “whatever does
not escape divine providence is revealed in the heavens.”<a id="FNanchor_2314" href="#Footnote_2314" class="fnanchor">[2314]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Better not
to destroy
the books
of necromancy.</div>

<p>In the seventeenth and last chapter the author returns
to the subject of books of necromancy and suggests that
after all even these had better be preserved rather than
destroyed, because the time is now perchance near when, for
reasons which he will not now disclose, it may be of advantage
to consult them occasionally; “yet let those inspecting
them beware of abuse of them.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Experimental
books in
the arts
of divination.</div>

<p>The author adds that there are also “certain experimental
books whose names have the same ending as nigromancy,”
namely, books in the subjects of geomancy, hydromancy,
aerimancy, pyromancy, and chiromancy. Thus we
have another example of the association of experiment and
magic. These arts, however, in his opinion “do not deserve
to be called sciences, but babblings (<i>garamantie</i> or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_702">[Pg 702]</span>
<i>garrimantiae</i>).”<a id="FNanchor_2315" href="#Footnote_2315" class="fnanchor">[2315]</a> Hydromancy consists in washing the
entrails of animals and inspecting the fibres. Pyromancy
divines from the appearance of the fire by which the sacrifice
is consumed. Both these arts probably involve a sort
of idolatry. The author finds nothing idolatrous in
geomancy, however, which is based upon astrology and
numbers. But aerimancy is frivolous, though it may pretend
to be based upon number. Chiromancy he does not
wish to judge hastily, because it may be a part of physiognomy
which in turn depends upon astrology, since in
physiognomy both the physical peculiarities and the personal
characteristics inferred from them are due to the stars. The
author thus shows the common tendency of medieval men
of learning to justify only such methods of divination as
they felt could be based upon astrology.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Resemblance
of
the <i>Speculum</i>
to
Albert’s
attitude to
astrology.</div>

<p>The foregoing analysis of the <i>Speculum astronomiae</i>
has made it evident that its attitude toward astrology is not
at all a peculiar one but just about the usual position of
Christian scientists in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.
On the subject of astrological images, however, its view is
that of Albertus Magnus and Roger Bacon rather than that
of William of Auvergne or Thomas Aquinas. In general
the astrological position of the <i>Speculum</i> closely parallels
the attitudes of Albertus Magnus and Roger Bacon, who in
turn held almost identical views. If anything, the <i>Speculum</i>
is somewhat less favorable to astrological doctrine than
Albertus. Whereas he in large measure accepted the casting
of horoscopes, although saving free will, it emphasizes
the conflict between free will and nativities. And it more
emphatically denies that the stars are animated, a point upon
which he seemed rather hazy in his scientific treatises. But
there is no actual contradiction between the <i>Speculum</i> and
other works of Albert on these points, and we have already
seen in the case of his theological and Aristotelian works
that Albert is likely to state the same thing somewhat differently
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_703">[Pg 703]</span>
according to the point-of-view from which he writes.
The writer of the <i>Speculum</i> is obviously desirous to conciliate
a theological opposition to or suspicion of “astronomy”
and therefore naturally inclines to be moderate and
conservative in his advocacy of astrological doctrine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Is it more
like Bacon
on the
question
of Christ’s
relation to
the stars?</div>

<p>On one point only does the <i>Speculum</i> appear more
radical in its astrological theory than Albert elsewhere and
more in accord with views expressed by Roger Bacon. We
have heard Albert in his <i>Summa</i> deny that Christ was born
under the influence of the stars, while Bacon was inclined
to agree with the astrologers that He was, in so far as His
birth was natural and His nature human. The writer of
the <i>Speculum</i> cites Albumasar to the effect that the Virgin
birth of Jesus Christ was prefigured in the sky,<a id="FNanchor_2316" href="#Footnote_2316" class="fnanchor">[2316]</a> and regards
this assertion as a notable confirmation of the true Faith,
not that the Lord of all things was under the stars but that
what God had decreed was signified by the stars. Thus
there is after all perhaps no necessary conflict with Albert’s
attitude in the <i>Summa</i>, since both <i>Speculum</i> and <i>Summa</i>
deny that Christ is under the stars. However, the <i>Speculum</i>
gives the impression that the birth of Christ was signified
astrologically; the <i>Summa</i>, that it was signified miraculously.
But neither does the <i>Speculum</i> quite agree with Bacon who
suggests that Christ’s body was under the stars. And the
fact that Bacon cites the same passage from Albumasar is
of little value as a sign that he is the author of the <i>Speculum</i>,
since the passage in Albumasar was a well-known one and
is cited in such a vernacular work as <i>The Romance of the
Rose</i>.<a id="FNanchor_2317" href="#Footnote_2317" class="fnanchor">[2317]</a> Thus the astrological doctrine of the <i>Speculum</i>
offers little or no reason for questioning the traditional
ascription of that treatise to Albertus Magnus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_704">[Pg 704]</span></p><div class="sidenote">Attitude
to magic
of the
<i>Speculum</i>
and
Albert.</div>

<p>We have next to inquire, does the attitude of the <i>Speculum</i>
to other magic arts accord or conflict with that of Albert
elsewhere? Our study of Albert’s attitude toward magic in
his other works has made it abundantly evident that Mandonnet
was mistaken in deeming him too hostile to such
superstition to have written the <i>Speculum</i>. He is, on the
contrary, too favorable, if anything, toward magic, to have
been the author of that treatise. Indeed, it was to the
<i>Speculum astronomiae</i>, which he accepted as a genuine work,
that Peter of Prussia appealed in his effort to prove Albert’s
hostility to necromancy and magic. Yet Mandonnet cites
these very pages of Peter of Prussia in his effort to show
that Albert was too hostile to occult arts to have written the
<i>Speculum</i>! On the other hand, we saw that Albert’s attitude
to magic varied somewhat in his different works, so it is no
disproof of his authorship of the <i>Speculum</i> that it seems
more hostile to magic than some of Albert’s utterances elsewhere.
The occasion of writing the treatise is probably
sufficient to explain this.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Of Bacon
and the
<i>Speculum</i>.</div>

<p>We have to admit, however, that Roger Bacon almost
invariably spoke of “magic” unfavorably, whereas Albert
a number of times used the word in a good or neutral sense.
Thus there might seem to be some reason for ascribing the
<i>Speculum</i> to Bacon for the exactly opposite reason to that
advanced by Mandonnet, namely, that he displayed more
hostility than Albert to magic. Also there is a certain resemblance
between the attitude of the author of the <i>Speculum</i>
toward books of necromancy and what we saw to be
Bacon’s attitude toward books of magic in his <i>De secretis
operibus artis et naturae et de nullitate magiae</i>. But there
is also a difference, and when Mandonnet asserts, “Both
authors reject books of magic,”<a id="FNanchor_2318" href="#Footnote_2318" class="fnanchor">[2318]</a> he gives a false impression
and overlooks an interesting point. For the <i>De secretis
operibus</i> not only tries to distinguish between books of magic
and others which are unjustly regarded as magical, it also
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_705">[Pg 705]</span>
is largely devoted to an attack upon “magic.” And such
censure of magic is frequent in Bacon’s works. The <i>Speculum</i>,
on the other hand, distinguishes between “necromantic”
and “astronomical” works, and never mentions “magic.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Significance
of
the failure
to mention
magic in
the <i>Speculum</i>.</div>

<p>Is not this significant? Had Bacon written the <i>Speculum</i>,
would he not have indulged in his usual censure of
magicians and their follies? But if Albert wrote the
<i>Speculum</i>, is it surprising that he maintains a discreet silence
concerning that “magic” which he had coupled more than
once with astronomy and had spoken of as a field bordering
upon that of natural science? In undertaking the defense
of “astronomical images” against those who looked at them
askance, would he deem it prudent to repeat his assertion in
the treatise on minerals that to comprehend astronomical
images one must go to “the science of the magi”? In that
treatise on minerals, it will be recalled, he had been bold
enough to propose to discuss the doctrine of images, even
if it was closely associated with necromancy, and he twice
associated in the same phrase “astronomy and magic and
the necromantic sciences.” But then he was writing for his
pupils and associates who were eager to learn of the images
engraved on gems, even if they were connected with necromancy.
In the <i>Speculum</i> he writes for a different audience,
or for an audience in a different mood,&mdash;men inclined to
condemn books of astronomy and astrology along with books
of necromancy. Where before he admitted an association,
he now has to make a contrast and to give the impression of
a great gulf fixed between necromancy and astronomy. To
save astrology from hostile attack he gives up necromancy,
and probably willingly and sincerely enough, since his allusions
to it even in the treatise on minerals were rather unfavorable.
Is it strange that he says nothing of the connecting
link, “magic,” which he perhaps does not wish to
condemn, yet does not feel it expedient to defend? May
it not be one of those reasons, which the author of the
<i>Speculum</i> says he will not disclose, why even the books of
necromancy had better be preserved rather than destroyed?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_706">[Pg 706]</span>
Thus the failure of the author of the <i>Speculum astronomiae</i>
to use the word “magic” does not sound in the least like
Roger Bacon, but does seem to be just about what one
might expect in the circumstances from Albert, whose mentions
moreover of “magic” in his other works are brief and
occasional.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Similarity
of its citations
to
those in
other
works of
Albert.</div>

<p>Finally we may note a positive bit of evidence in favor
of the Albertine authorship of the <i>Speculum</i> which has
hitherto escaped notice. His other writings mention some
of the very books of necromancy which the <i>Speculum</i> lists
and condemns. In his theological <i>Summa</i>, when denouncing
magic as concerned with evil spirits, he supported his
view not merely by the authority of the saints and common
report, but also by “the teachings of that branch of
necromancy” which treats of “images and rings and mirrors
of Venus and seals of demons,” and is expounded in the
writings of Achot of Greece, Grema of Babylon, Hermes the
Egyptian, and other treatises which he mentions.<a id="FNanchor_2319" href="#Footnote_2319" class="fnanchor">[2319]</a> Again
in the treatise on minerals, in investigating why gems are
engraved with images, he cites as authorities Magor Graecus,
Germa Babylonicus, and Hermes the Egyptian.<a id="FNanchor_2320" href="#Footnote_2320" class="fnanchor">[2320]</a> The
<i>Speculum</i> also especially mentions in its list of necromantic
books on images Toz Graeci, Germath of Babylon, Belenus,
and Hermes.<a id="FNanchor_2321" href="#Footnote_2321" class="fnanchor">[2321]</a> Leaving Belenus out of account, there can
be little doubt that the other three names are identical with
the two preceding trios. One also is impelled to believe that
the same Albert wrote <i>Summa</i>, <i>Mineralium</i>, and <i>Speculum</i>,
and it may be added that the variation in the attitude towards
images and necromancy in the latter two is no greater than
the difference in the attitude towards magic which we observed
between the first two of those treatises. This too
makes it plausible that Albert should have adopted a third
attitude of silence concerning “magic” in the <i>Speculum</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_707">[Pg 707]</span></p><div class="sidenote">Is the
<i>Speculum
astronomiae</i>
to
be connected
with the
condemnation
of
1277?</div>

<p>There remains the question, when and why was the
<i>Speculum astronomiae</i> written? Its tone suggests that it
is not merely a general defense of astronomy and astrology
but a specific reply to some particular attack upon astrological
literature made by a party inclined to connect and
condemn astrology together with necromancy and other forbidden
occult arts. Such an attack can perhaps be seen in
the condemnation at Paris in 1277 of two hundred and
nineteen opinions attributed to Siger de Brabant. Many
of them are astrological and with them are condemned a
treatise of geomancy, works of necromancy, and books “containing
experiments of lot-casters, invocations of demons,
and conjurations perilous to the soul.”<a id="FNanchor_2322" href="#Footnote_2322" class="fnanchor">[2322]</a> It is natural to
associate the writing of the <i>Speculum astronomiae</i> with this
affair, and the idea had occurred to me before I read any
of Mandonnet’s works. It is also natural, especially if one
holds the old view that Roger Bacon was persecuted for
science’s sake and suspected of magic, to wonder if there
is not some connection between the condemnation of 1277
and his own condemnation in 1278 “on account of certain
suspected novelties”; and Mandonnet is not the first to do
so.<a id="FNanchor_2323" href="#Footnote_2323" class="fnanchor">[2323]</a> But he is the first to suggest that Bacon was condemned
in 1278 for having written the <i>Speculum astronomiae</i>
in connection with the other condemnation of 1277.
But we have seen that there is little reason for thinking that
Bacon’s condemnation was for astrology or magic. Second,
it may be doubted whether anyone would have been condemned
for so mild a work as the <i>Speculum astronomiae</i>,
nor in 1277 could its contents have been regarded as “novelties.”
Third, we have shown that Albert and not Bacon
wrote the <i>Speculum</i>. Fourth, we have already heard that
in 1270 Albert sent a treatise to Paris to help Aquinas in
connection with the affair of Siger de Brabant, and that in
1277 he came to Paris himself to defend his own Aristotelian
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_708">[Pg 708]</span>
teaching and the memory of Aquinas in connection
with the condemnation of the 219 articles. If so, who could
have been better fitted to write on that occasion as a representative
both of the Faith and of Philosophy than the
venerable dean both of Christian theologians and of Aristotelian
scientists?</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
<i>Speculum</i>
was written
before
1277.</div>

<p>But there is a serious objection to dating the <i>Speculum
astronomiae</i> as late as 1277, especially if Albert is its author,
as we have shown every reason to believe. It is that the
writer of the <i>Speculum</i> speaks of the twelfth and thirteenth
(meaning our thirteenth and fourteenth) books of the <i>Metaphysics</i>
of Aristotle as “not yet translated.”<a id="FNanchor_2324" href="#Footnote_2324" class="fnanchor">[2324]</a> But Albert is
acquainted with these books and gives a paraphrase of them
in his own Commentary on the Metaphysics, which, as
Mandonnet himself has elsewhere shown,<a id="FNanchor_2325" href="#Footnote_2325" class="fnanchor">[2325]</a> was completed in
1256. It is true that Aquinas in his <i>De unitate intellectus
contra Averroistas</i>, written in 1270, still seems to regard
the last books of the <i>Metaphysics</i> as untranslated,<a id="FNanchor_2326" href="#Footnote_2326" class="fnanchor">[2326]</a> which
leads Grabmann to argue that Albert must have revised his
Commentary to include the last books of the <i>Metaphysics</i>
after 1270.<a id="FNanchor_2327" href="#Footnote_2327" class="fnanchor">[2327]</a> But this fails to explain how Albert or anyone
else writing in 1277 or 1278 could still speak of these
books as “not yet translated,” since Albert could neither
have translated nor commented upon them after 1277, since
he died in 1280 and Ptolemy of Lucca tells us that for about
three years before his death his intellectual faculties had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_709">[Pg 709]</span>
declined. Thus the <i>Speculum astronomiae</i> was apparently
written before 1277 and perhaps before 1256.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Condemnation
of
Siger de
Brabant.</div>

<p>Although it thus appears to have no actual connection
with the <i>Speculum astronomiae</i>, we may nevertheless consider
here as bearing on the same topic of theological opposition
to certain occult arts and even to astrology, the
condemnation in 1277 by Stephen, bishop of Paris, and
“doctors of sacred Scripture” of 219 opinions attributed
to “Siger de Brabant, Boetius of Denmark, and others.”
Siger seems to have been an Averroist of somewhat pronounced
type and to have held views more evidently incompatible
with the Christian Faith than most astrologers or
occult scientists. It is possible, however, that his opponents
misinterpreted or exaggerated his views. Mandonnet holds
that he would have disowned many of the articles, and that,
on the other hand, his persecutors inserted also moderate
opinions such as were held by Albertus Magnus and Aquinas,
in an effort to give the impression that infidels, Averroists,
and moderate Aristotelians were all alike, and to discredit
the reconciliation of Aristotle and Christian doctrine which
Albert and Aquinas fathered.<a id="FNanchor_2328" href="#Footnote_2328" class="fnanchor">[2328]</a> Dante speaks well of Siger
in the <i>Paradiso</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Condemned
opinions
connected
with astrology;
with
science
and

<p>We may note those articles which bear upon astrology,
a very considerable number, with the addition of a few
concerned with the relations of science and theology. It
will be observed that the moderate thirtieth article is scarcely
consistent with some others, and that the last clause of the
207th article, which seems an explanation inserted by the
condemners, indicates that even they accept the influence of
the stars within certain limits. In any case, while it is to
be remembered that the condemnation is not primarily directed
against astrology, the articles are of interest as showing
both what adherents of astrology might believe and
what its opponents might accuse them of and condemn them
for.</p>

<p>In our chapter on Raymond Lull we shall speak of a treatise
written by him in 1297 in which he deals with some of these
opinions condemned in 1277.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Other
later
moves
against
magic at
Paris.</div>

<p>With the condemnation in 1277 along with the opinions
of Siger of Brabant of a geomancy, books of necromancy,
and others containing invocations of spirits, may be mentioned
two later attempts of authorities to discourage the
study or practice of magic at Paris. One, to which we
have already alluded in our chapter on Roger Bacon, is a
constitution of the Franciscans on May 25, 1292, forbidding
their students at Paris to spend for other purposes
the money sent them for books or to have curious books
copied.<a id="FNanchor_2333" href="#Footnote_2333" class="fnanchor">[2333]</a> We are, however, more pained than surprised to
learn that such a regulation was necessary in the Order.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_713">[Pg 713]</span>
The other is a letter of April 3, 1318, or 1319, of Pope
John XXII to William, bishop of Paris, thanking him for
a donation received and urging him to attend to the improvement
of the University of Paris and especially to
banish from it and from his diocese “nigromancers, diviners,
poisoners, and others engaged in reprehensible arts of this
sort,” whom the pope further describes as criminals.<a id="FNanchor_2334" href="#Footnote_2334" class="fnanchor">[2334]</a> There
is nothing to suggest that astrologers and their writings are
included in either of these two later moves against superstitious
arts or black magic.</p>

of the second column on fol. 1r is occupied by the text of the

liber hermetis” which are the conclusion of the treatise on

fifteen stars, stones, and herbs at fols. 13v-16v. The Speculum is
followed at fol. 7r by the De urina non visa of William of England
or Marseilles and other astrological treatises. At fols. 38v-40v
and 25r-32v is an astrological passage from what is called in
the headings at the tops of the pages “Meth’a Rog’i” (Metaphysics
of Roger), which Mr. Steele has printed in Opera hactenus
inedita Rogeri Baconi, Fasc. 1. But the occurrence of
this fragment in the same MS with the Speculum can scarcely
be adduced as any indication of the Baconian authorship of the
Speculum, since the same later hand, which has here inserted
“Incipit methafisica Rogeri baconis de ordine predicatorum”
(<i>sic!</i>), wrote in the ascription of the Speculum to Albert.</p>

<p>BN 7408, 15th century. Here the Speculum is bound at the close
of a MS containing astronomical and astrological works. It is
ascribed to Albert not only in the general table of contents for
the MS and in a Titulus written at its beginning in another
hand than its text, but the text itself closes, “Expliciunt liber
dicta speculum alberti magni de nominibus librorum astronomie
tam demonstrativorum quam judicialium quem composuit frater
albertus ut sciatur qui libri sunt contra fidem et qui non.” The
same hand then goes on to cite Albert’s work on minerals concerning
images on stones.</p>

<p>BN 7335, 15th century, fols. 108r-114v, “Incipit libellus alberti
magni de discretione astronomie a falsa aliter intitulatus speculum
... / ... Explicit tractatus qui dicitur speculum domini
alberti.”</p>

<p>Digby 228, 14th century, fol. 76-, no author is named in the text
itself of the Speculum but in the upper margin of this page a
hand of the same century has written the following note: “Tractatus
magistri Philippi cancellarii Parisiensis de libris astronomie
qui tenendi sunt secundum integritatem fidei catholice et qui
non.” This MS seems to give a more correct text than any of
the three following other MSS in the Bodleian.</p>

<p>Ashmole 345, later 14th century (the name, “Kenelme Digby,” is
written at the top of the first page of the MS), fols. 14v-21,
Tractatus in quo corriguntur errores quorundam astrologorum
et philosophorum fidei catholicae repugnantes, “Occasione quorundam
librorum apud quos non est radix scientie ... / ...
sed quod ambo inveniuntur ab eodem creata. Explicit.” Although
it opens as usual, it omits much of the earlier chapters
and bibliography of the Speculum. No author seems to be
named.</p>

<p>Digby 81, on paper, fols. 102-18, “Explicit iste tractatus quem
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_716">[Pg 716]</span>
composuit Albertus frater predicator.” But a hand of the 17th
century adds the note, “Albertus non fuit author huius libri sed
Philippus cancellarius Parisiensis, ut ex vetustissimo exemplari
manuscripto manifestum est,” which I presume is a reference to
the note to that effect in Digby 228. As a table of contents for
this portion of the MS at fol. 101r shows, this “Albertus de
scientiis licitis et illicitis” was once followed by “Cosmographia
Rogeri Bacon”; but it will be noted that although the 17th century
hand questions Albert’s authorship, its writer was not moved
to ascribe the Speculum to Bacon.</p>

<p>Canon. Misc. 517, 15th century, fols. 52v-59v, “Incipit speculum
alberti ... / ... finis Spectubili Alberti.” Written in a print-like
hand which is prettier than Digby 228, but the text nevertheless
contains a good many slips, as in the omission of words
from the Incipits in the bibliographies of deserving and illicit
books. Also it has 19 chapters instead of the usual 17, as in
Digby 228 and the printed text.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="APPENDIX_II_LXII">APPENDIX II</h3>
</div>

<p class="h3sub">GERMATH OF BABYLON, GERGIS, AND GIRGITH</p>

<p>Germa or Grema or Germath of Babylon is a name to
which I believe I have met only one other reference,
namely, in Ceceo d’Ascoli’s <i>Commentary on the De principiis
of Alchabitius</i> (ed. Boffito, p. 19), where for the assertion
that the stone <i>anthrax</i> keeps emitting water and so
also has to attract water to supply the loss are cited “Evax
rex arabum et Zot grecus et Germa babilonensis.”</p>

<p>In another chapter of the <i>Speculum</i> in listing licit works
of “astronomy” the author mentions Gergis, <i>De significatione
planetarum in domibus</i>, which opens, “Sol consurgit.”
It is perhaps the same as Ashmole 393, 15th century(?),
fols. 68v-69v, “Gergis de significatione planetarum ac capitis
et caude in 12 domibus. Sol in ascendente significat principatum
... / ... neque dimittas que dico tibi nec proferes
aliud. Explicit Jergis de significationibus planetarum in
domibus 12.” See also Steinschneider (1906) pp. 23-4,
where other MSS of this treatise are mentioned and also of
a “Girgic, De mansionibus lunae.” Other forms of the
name than Gergis and Girgic mentioned by Steinschneider
are Zergis, Jergis, Jargus (Hyargus, Largus) and Georgius;
also Gugit. Steinschneider further notes that this author
appears in the alchemistic <i>Turba</i>; in which connection I may
add that Albertus Magnus in <i>Mineralium</i> III, i, 4, speaks of
a writer on alchemy from that part of Spain which used
to belong to the Arabs named Gilgil (Gilgil in secretis suis).</p>

<p>Steinschneider does not note Royal 12-C-XVIII where,
following the work of Thebit ben Corat on images, is “another
tract on the same subject, apparently by Jirgis ibn
al-ʿAmid. Inc. ‘Dixit Balemiz qui Apollo dicitur Ymago
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_719">[Pg 719]</span>
prima fit in prima hora.’ Ends, ‘nomen diei Saturni hadah.
Explicit.’” Here then Jirgis is associated with Belenus just
as Germath of Babylon was in the <i>Speculum</i>.</p>

<p>In another MS not mentioned by Steinschneider a <i>Theory
of Magic Art</i>, which reminds one of the work of Alkindi
by that title, is ascribed to a Girgith. Amplon. Quarto 354,
14th century, fols. 60-62, Girgith, Theorica de arte magica,
“Cogitacio fuit: res que me ad hoc opusculum ... / ...
operari voluerit et sic est finis huius tractatus. Deo gratias.”</p>

<p>And in the medieval catalogue of St. Augustine’s, Canterbury,
1545, we find listed “Documenta Girgith filie
Circes,” preceded by “Tractatus de sigillis planetarum.”
That is, Girgith is represented as the daughter of the enchantress
Circe, and is apparently connected with magical
and astrological images. This community of astrological
and magical interest inclines one to believe that all the
aforesaid authors are one.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The three
treatises.</div>

<p>If we have succeeded in showing that there is little reason
for questioning the traditional ascription of the <i>Speculum
astronomiae</i> to Albertus Magnus, and still less reason for
attributing it to anyone else, it must on the other hand be
admitted that the authenticity of three other treatises current
under his name is more dubious. To the consideration
of these three treatises we now come, namely, the <i>Experimenta
Alberti</i>, <i>De mirabilibus mundi</i>, and <i>De secretis
mulierum</i>. <i>The Experiments of Albert</i>, or <i>The Secrets of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_721">[Pg 721]</span>
Albert</i> (<i>Secreta Alberti</i>), as it is usually called in the manuscripts,
in the printed editions is generally entitled <i>Liber
aggregationis</i>, or the book of secrets or virtues of certain
herbs, animals, and stones.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Are
the two
treatises
on magic
by Albert?</div>

<p>When Albertus Magnus in his treatises on the works
of Aristotle in natural philosophy dismissed certain matters
as pertaining to the science of magic rather than to physical
science, and said that they should be considered in other
treatises, it is just possible that he intended to write such
books himself. He does not, however, seem to have cited
any such writings of his own by title in any of his undisputedly
genuine works. Such writings are nevertheless extant
under his name, namely, the above-mentioned <i>Experiments
of Albert</i> and <i>Marvels of the Universe</i>. These two
treatises already circulated under his name in the middle
ages and appeared in numerous editions in the early years
of the printing-press.<a id="FNanchor_2335" href="#Footnote_2335" class="fnanchor">[2335]</a> Indeed, a survey of the catalogue in
such a library as the British Museum indicates that these
treatises were published in about as many editions as all
Albert’s numerous other works put together. This suggests
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_722">[Pg 722]</span>
how much more popular were these brief collections of
superstitious experiments and sensational marvels than
Albert’s longer, more difficult and argumentative, theological
and scientific writings.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Manuscripts
of
the <i>Experiments</i>.</div>

<p>Of these two treatises the <i>Liber aggregationis</i> or <i>Experiments</i>
or <i>Secrets of Albert</i> is found in a number of
manuscripts of the British Museum, Bodleian, and other
libraries.<a id="FNanchor_2336" href="#Footnote_2336" class="fnanchor">[2336]</a> These are dated in the catalogues as mainly of
the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth centuries. The text
is not uniform either in the printed editions or the manuscripts.
Some manuscripts contain only part of the treatise
or arrange its items in a different order, and sometimes
foreign matter is interpolated, but it is clear that they are
all different portions or versions of one work. Indeed the
three Digby manuscripts in the Bodleian contain practically
the same text, and would seem to be copies of one another or
of a common original, since an illegible phrase in one is apt
to be equally unreadable in the rest. They also all entitle
the work the <i>Secrets</i> rather than the <i>Experiments of Albert</i>.
Most of the manuscripts expressly attribute the work to
Albert who is variously styled “Albertus Magnus,” “Brother
Albert,” “Brother Albert of the Order of Preachers,” or
“Brother Albert of Cologne of the Order of Preaching
Friars.” One manuscript says that Albertus Magnus translated
these experiments with herbs, stones, and animals from
the Greek and Arabic. Only one of the manuscripts, where
a part of the experiments with herbs are called <i>Jocalia
Salamonis</i>, ascribes the work to anyone else than Albert.
Borgnet, who did not include either the <i>De mirabilibus mundi</i>
or <i>Liber aggregationis</i> in his edition of Albert’s works, mentions
another manuscript where the latter treatise is ascribed
to “Brother Albert of Saxony.” But aside from the fact
that the evidence of a single manuscript is worth little against
so many others, if we find the <i>Experiments</i> and <i>Secrets</i>
in manuscripts of the thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_723">[Pg 723]</span>
the work cannot possibly be written by Albert of
Saxony who did not flourish until about 1351 to 1361.
Moreover, in the fourteenth century manuscripts our treatise
is found with other experimental and occult treatises of
varied authors, so that it would appear to have been known
for some time and copied from earlier manuscripts into
these collections. Whether the treatise is by Albert or not,
then, there seems no doubt that it was generally ascribed
to him in the later middle ages, and that it was composed
in the thirteenth century, or at least that the nucleus of it
existed then.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Manuscripts
of the
<i>Marvels</i>.</div>

<p>Of the <i>De mirabilibus mundi</i> manuscripts seem much
rarer.<a id="FNanchor_2337" href="#Footnote_2337" class="fnanchor">[2337]</a> I found none in the British Museum, although it
contains so many of the <i>Experiments of Albert</i> which almost
invariably accompanies the <i>Marvels</i> in the printed editions.
It is also rather remarkable that the former treatise
is always called the <i>Experiments</i> or <i>Secrets of Albert</i> in
the manuscripts, and <i>Liber aggregationis</i> in the printed editions.<a id="FNanchor_2338" href="#Footnote_2338" class="fnanchor">[2338]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Evidence
of a
fourteenth
century
bibliography.</div>

<p>Further evidence that the <i>Experiments</i> was at least attributed
to Albert at an early date and on the other hand
that the <i>De mirabilibus mundi</i> was not, is afforded by the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_724">[Pg 724]</span>
bibliography of works by learned Dominicans drawn up
in the second quarter of the fourteenth century. Here we
find listed among Albert’s writings<a id="FNanchor_2339" href="#Footnote_2339" class="fnanchor">[2339]</a> a <i>De lapidibus et
herbis</i> which may well be the <i>Experimenta</i>, since his <i>De
vegetabilibus et plantis</i> and <i>De mineralibus</i> are listed separately,
and a <i>Secretum secretorum Alberti</i> which may indicate
either the <i>Experiments</i> or <i>Secrets</i> or perhaps the <i>De
secretis mulierum</i>. On the other hand, in the same bibliography
we find a <i>De mirabilibus</i> listed not among the writings
of Albertus Magnus but attributed to an Arnold of Liège.<a id="FNanchor_2340" href="#Footnote_2340" class="fnanchor">[2340]</a>
Perhaps this is why Berthelot states, without giving any
reference or reason, that the <i>De mirabilibus mundi</i> was
written in the fourteenth century by a pupil of Albertus
Magnus.<a id="FNanchor_2341" href="#Footnote_2341" class="fnanchor">[2341]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Opinions
of modern
writers.</div>

<p>In modern times some writers have accepted these two
treatises as Albert’s, perhaps unthinkingly, while others have
rejected them as spurious. Thus Cockayne gives the description
of the herb <i>Heliotropium</i> from the <i>De virtutibus
herbarum</i>, another name for the <i>Experiments</i> or <i>Liber
aggregationis</i>, as by Albertus Magnus.<a id="FNanchor_2342" href="#Footnote_2342" class="fnanchor">[2342]</a> And we find Hoefer
reproving Haller and Sprengel for having judged Albertus
Magnus too severely on the basis of the same <i>De viribus
herbarum</i>, “a book of cabalistic recipes” which Hoefer asserts
is not his.<a id="FNanchor_2343" href="#Footnote_2343" class="fnanchor">[2343]</a> Borgnet who, as has been said, excluded
our two treatises from his edition of Albert’s works, held
that the “vain and futile matters” which they contain are
enough to prove that they cannot be by Albert. Of this
the reader may judge for himself by comparing some of the
passages concerning occult virtue, astrology, magic, and
experiments with toads and emeralds which we have already
cited from Albert’s works with those which we shall soon
give from these two treatises. As the <i>Histoire Littéraire de
la France</i> says in its article on Albert, “It must be confessed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_725">[Pg 725]</span>
that all his treatises let be seen too often his leaning toward
the occult sciences; and they contain, at least in part, the
germ of the wretched productions falsely published under
his name.”<a id="FNanchor_2344" href="#Footnote_2344" class="fnanchor">[2344]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Meyer’s
argument
against the
authenticity
of
the <i>Experiments</i>.</div>

<p>Meyer in his <i>History of Botany</i><a id="FNanchor_2345" href="#Footnote_2345" class="fnanchor">[2345]</a> made more detailed
objections to the Albertine authorship of the <i>Liber aggregationis</i>.
He argued that Albert’s genuine works display a
more elegant style and logical arrangement, that the <i>Liber
aggregationis</i> does not depend on Aristotle as the genuine
scientific works do, and that Albert elsewhere condemns the
magic which he here expounds. But we have shown that
Albert does not always condemn even so-called magic in
his other writings, that it is not inconceivable that he may
have written treatises on natural magic himself, and that
he follows Aristotle only where he has works of Aristotle at
hand to follow. Argument from style is always dangerous,
since style is apt to alter with the subject and method of a
treatise. Furthermore, Meyer seems to have judged the style
of the <i>Liber aggregationis</i> from the printed text which often
differs in wording from the manuscripts. However, I do
not know that their style is any more elegant; the manuscripts
are hard to read and often seem incoherent. In
any case the treatise is mainly a collection of brief statements,
largely excerpted from other writings, with little room
either for literary elegance or logical arrangement. Meyer
further noted, however, that the <i>Liber aggregationis</i> gave a
different explanation of two names of herbs, <i>Quinquefolium</i>
and <i>Jusquiasmus</i> (or <i>Jusquiamus</i>), from that given in Albert’s
<i>On vegetables and plants</i>. Even this divergence might,
however, be due to Albert’s having followed different authorities
in the two works; the <i>Liber aggregationis</i> or <i>Experiments</i>
seems to draw largely from <i>Kiranides</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Difficulty
of the
question.</div>

<p>It may be admitted that the <i>Experiments</i> and <i>Marvels</i>
seem in general rather inferior to Albert’s undisputed works,
which embody the same sort of superstitions, it is true, but
are less exclusively devoted to that sort of thing. But we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_726">[Pg 726]</span>
must expect treatises which deal expressly with magic and
marvels to be more superstitious than those which deal professedly
with Aristotelian theories and facts learned by
experience concerning the natural sciences. Compare the
writings of Sir Oliver Lodge on physics and on psychic
research. And if the <i>Experiments</i> and most of the <i>Marvels</i>
seem naïve, simple, and unsophisticated compared to the
more elaborate arrangement and detail and scholastic argument
of the undisputed works of Albert, it is to be noted
that they are like other books of their kind, just as the
others are like other Aristotelian and scholastic treatises.
But from these difficult and hypothetical questions of authenticity
or spuriousness let us turn to the writings themselves.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Introduction
of the
<i>Experiments</i>.</div>

<p>Meyer said that in the <i>Liber aggregationis</i> one did not
find Albert’s chief source, Aristotle. Yet the <i>Experiments
of Albert</i> open in the manuscripts with the words, “As the
philosopher says,” to which one manuscript adds, “in the
first book of the <i>Metaphysics</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_2346" href="#Footnote_2346" class="fnanchor">[2346]</a> The philosopher’s dictum
was to the effect that all science is good but that it may
be employed either for good or evil ends. Our author then
affirms that “magical science”<a id="FNanchor_2347" href="#Footnote_2347" class="fnanchor">[2347]</a> is not evil, since by knowledge
of it one can avoid evil and secure good. This is not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_727">[Pg 727]</span>
unlike the way in which Albert in his <i>Minerals</i> justified the
science of images as good doctrine, even if it was a part of
necromancy, or showed in other passages that astrology was
not contrary to freedom of the will since it enabled one
to avoid evils and to obtain goods. By this statement the
author also serves notice that magical science or the science
of magic is to be the subject of the present treatise. Continuing
his preface, he mentions “inspection of reasons and
natural experiments” as well as “ancient authors” or “doctors”
as sources. He has tested many of the statements of
these authorities and has found truth in many of them. In
the present treatise he intends to make use of the book of
Kiranides and the book of Alcorath, later said to be by
Hermes, and to speak first of certain herbs, then of certain
stones and certain animals and of their virtues. The oldest
manuscript that I have seen also promises to treat of the
virtue of words,<a id="FNanchor_2348" href="#Footnote_2348" class="fnanchor">[2348]</a> but this promise is not fulfilled and is
omitted in the printed text. It may also be remarked now
that other authorities than Kiranides and Alcorath are cited
in the course of the treatise.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Virtues
of herbs,
stones, and
animals.</div>

<p>The author then considers sixteen herbs,<a id="FNanchor_2349" href="#Footnote_2349" class="fnanchor">[2349]</a> about forty-five
stones,<a id="FNanchor_2350" href="#Footnote_2350" class="fnanchor">[2350]</a> and some eighteen animals,<a id="FNanchor_2351" href="#Footnote_2351" class="fnanchor">[2351]</a> many of which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_728">[Pg 728]</span>
are birds. In the printed text and some manuscripts there
are also given the virtues of seven herbs according to the
emperor Alexander, which is really a distinct treatise of
which we have spoken elsewhere. The names are sometimes
given in several languages after the manner of the <i>Herbarium</i>
of the Pseudo-Apuleius. Thus a treatise which began with
justification of magical science turns out to be simply a
treatment of the virtues of natural objects. But this shows
the importance of natural objects in magic, and the virtues
here ascribed to them are often indeed magical. One may
become invisible, escape dangers, travel in safety, conquer
the enemy, win honors, not feel pain, boil water instantly or
freeze boiling water or kindle an inextinguishable fire, make
a rainbow appear or the sun seem blood-red, excite love between
two persons, or arouse joy, sadness, and other emotional
and intellectual states, overpower wild beasts, interpret
any dream, and prophesy concerning the future. In
brief, by the aid of the occult virtues of these natural objects
one can accomplish almost anything that any other form of
magic could procure. Two or three examples may be given
in more detail.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The heliotrope.</div>

<p>The first herb discussed, the heliotrope, if plucked when
the sun is in the sign Leo in August and worn wrapped in
a laurel leaf with the tooth of a wolf, insures that the bearer
of it will be addressed with none but friendly words. If
a person who has been robbed sleeps with it beneath his pillow,
he will see all the circumstances of the theft repeated
in his dreams. If it is placed in a temple, women who have

leave the temple until this herb is removed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The lily.</div>

<p>The lily is an herb which the <i>Magi</i> have greatly lauded.
It, too, should be plucked when the sun is in Leo, then mixed
with laurel juice and buried beneath ordure until worms are
generated therefrom. No one can sleep in whose clothing
or about whose neck is sprinkled some of the powder made
from these worms. Anyone anointed with this powder will
contract a fever. If this powder is put in a jar of milk
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_729">[Pg 729]</span>
covered with the skin of a cow of one color, the entire herd
will cease to give milk. “And this has been tested in our time
by certain sorcerers.”<a id="FNanchor_2352" href="#Footnote_2352" class="fnanchor">[2352]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Two
gems.</div>

<p>The stone Optalmius, wrapped in a laurel leaf, renders
one invisible, as its virtue blinds the sight of onlookers. By
its aid Constantine became invisible in the thick of the fight.
A test of virginity by the stone Galerites is ascribed to
Avicenna. In operating with stones the bearer of the gem
should be free from all pollution in order to secure a good
result, a magic commonplace.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The owl.</div>

<p>If the heart and right foot of an owl are placed upon a
sleeper’s breast, “he will tell whatever he has done and whatever
you ask him.”<a id="FNanchor_2353" href="#Footnote_2353" class="fnanchor">[2353]</a> “And this was tested experimentally
by our brothers recently.”<a id="FNanchor_2354" href="#Footnote_2354" class="fnanchor">[2354]</a> No dog will bark at a person
who carries these same parts of an owl in his armpit, and together
with an owl’s wing they will attract all sorts of birds
to a tree where they are suspended.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Evax and
Aaron,
and the
crow.</div>

<p>It is interesting to note that Evax and Aaron, who were
cited in Albert’s <i>Minerals</i>, are here cited for the virtues of
animals as well, the crow, taxo, and hare.<a id="FNanchor_2355" href="#Footnote_2355" class="fnanchor">[2355]</a> Their crow
story, however, also concerns a stone. If a crow’s eggs are
cooked and then replaced in the nest, the bird flies away to
the Red Sea and returns with a stone whose touch turns the
eggs raw again. This stone is valuable to human beings for
other purposes. Set in a ring with the usual laurel leaf, its
touch opens closed gates and frees prisoners from their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_730">[Pg 730]</span>
chains. If one puts it in one’s mouth, one can understand
the language of the birds. One manuscript<a id="FNanchor_2356" href="#Footnote_2356" class="fnanchor">[2356]</a> speaks of this
procedure with the crow’s eggs as an experiment of a master
Dacus, rather than of Aaron and Evax, and says that the
stone brought by the crow aids conception. To have a
male child the stone should be held in the right hand; in
the left, for a female.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Observance
of
astrology.</div>

<p>Astrological conditions had to be observed in some of
the procedure already recounted. In conclusion the general
principle is also laid down apart from any particular recipe,
that to work a good effect one should operate under the influence
of a benevolent planet like Jupiter or Venus, and
to work an evil effect under a malevolent planet. “Whoever
observes this rule correctly will without doubt find
truth and the greatest efficacy in what we have said, as I
have experienced with our brothers.”<a id="FNanchor_2357" href="#Footnote_2357" class="fnanchor">[2357]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Emphasis
upon experiment.</div>

<p>This last expression and others like it which have been
previously noted, together with the title, <i>Experimenta
Alberti</i>, attest the experimental character of our treatise,
which is to be classed as one of those “books of experiments”
or “experimental books” which we have heard so
often mentioned and of which our next two chapters will
especially treat. This expression and its fellows further remind
us&mdash;perhaps are intended to remind us&mdash;of Albert’s
allusions to the personal experiences of himself or his <i>socii</i>
in his undisputed works. If our treatise is not by Albert,
there can at least be little doubt that it pretends to be a
product of his experimental school among the Dominicans
at Cologne.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>De mirabilibus
mundi</i> is
more theoretical.</div>

<p>The <i>Marvels of the Universe</i> contains more theoretical
discussion of much the usual scholastic sort than the <i>Experiments</i>,
and so approximates rather more nearly to the
form of most of Albert’s works. As against the brief introductory
paragraph of the <i>Experiments</i>, the <i>Marvels</i> enters
upon a long and learned preliminary discussion of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_731">[Pg 731]</span>
validity, causes, and principles of magic before beginning
its list of particular marvels.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How account
for
magic?</div>

<p>The author states that after he knew “that the work
of the wise man is to make marvels cease” by scientific explanation
of them, he searched the writings of authorities
until he understood the causes of most marvelous works.
One extremely marvelous thing, however, continued to
puzzle him, yet its existence he regards as evident to all
men, even the vulgar. This was the binding of men by incantations,
characters, sorcery, words, and by many quite
common objects. For this he could find no sufficient cause
and it seemed impossible. But after he had puzzled long,
he found a plausible statement by Avicenna in the sixth
book of the <i>Naturalia</i> that there exists in the human mind a
certain power of altering objects, and that other objects obey
the human mind when it is aroused to a great excess of love
or hatred toward anyone of them. In such circumstances
manifest experience shows that the mind can bind and alter
objects as it desires. The author, however, for a long time
remained still incredulous. But when he came to read books
of necromancy and images and magic, he found in them this
same theory that the human soul can alter its own body or
exterior objects, especially if its influence concurs with a
favorable astrological hour. Moreover, men differ in their
natural capacity to influence others or to be influenced by
them. Some men cannot be bewitched; others cannot be
freed from the power which another has established over
them; still others can both be bewitched and set free from
sorcery.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Action of
characters
explained.</div>

<p>The discussion then turns for a time from magical influence
in general to that of characters in particular. Their
force depends upon the power of the mind of the operator
and the celestial virtue at the time of their construction. A
distinction is made between characters written blindly in a
frenzy and those constructed scientifically with some likeness
to the object sought, as when embracing figures are placed
in a love charm. Such scientific characters our author prefers
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_732">[Pg 732]</span>
as more rational and possessing greater virtue. He
states that later he will list from various books particular
characters and words for making or destroying this or that.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Incredible
“experiments
of
authorities”
upheld.</div>

<p>Resuming his more general discussion, the author defends
“the many experiments of authorities,”&mdash;a phrase
which should warn us against attempting sharply to distinguish
between medieval trust in authorities and medieval
experimental tendencies. Some deem these “experiments of
authorities” incredible, but he supports them as “most certain
science.” His argument therefor is the too subtle and
ingenious plea that surely no philosopher would purposely
write such apparent falsehoods, unless he were sure of their
truth, since even an ignorant man does not willingly write
what is manifestly false. Hence these seemingly incredible
statements must be true.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Laws of
nature and
of magic.</div>

<p>The author then lays down some general laws of nature
such as that every species seeks its kind, fire moving toward
fire, and water toward water. Also that an object is gradually
changed into likeness to its surroundings. Thus
Avicenna says that an object turns to salt when it has stood
in salt for a long time; and if wild animals remain long
with men, they become domesticated. Philosophers have
discovered “the dispositions of natural entities,” such as
heat, cold, boldness, wrath, fear, sterility, the ardor of love,
or any other virtue. For instance, audacity is a quality
innate in all members of the lion species. Knowledge of
these innate qualities is of great assistance in marvelous
and secret operations. Another great law is that like loves
like. Medical men, alchemists, and scientists generally verify
this assertion. Furthermore, “every nature, particular or
general, has a natural friendship or enmity for some other,
and some have this for the entire species and for all time,
while others have it for an individual only and for a fixed
time.” Proof of this is to be seen in the case of certain animals
who hate each other in life and whose parts, even whose
hairs, retain this repugnance after death. Thus the lion’s
skin injures all other pelts; while sheepskin is consumed by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_733">[Pg 733]</span>
wolfskin, and a drum made of the latter silences one made
of the former.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Man’s
magic
power.</div>

<p>The author then returns to the magic power in man.
He believes that it is clear to everyone that man is the end
of all nature and should be supreme over it. Man possesses
all the marvelous virtues to be found throughout the natural
world; even the demons obey him; “and in the very human
body all the secret arts are worked and ... every marvel
issues from it.” All these powers, however, are not found
in one man at the same time, but in different individuals at
different times. The details of this relationship of man to
the world of nature are revealed not by reason but by
experience,&mdash;a Galenic and Albertine distinction of which
the author of the <i>De mirabilibus mundi</i> is quite fond.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A wonderful
world.</div>

<p>Everything in nature is equally full of marvelous virtue.
Fires are not more marvelous than waters, the virtues of
pepper are no greater than those of jusquiam. One cannot
dispute this, whether one attributes marvelous virtues primarily
to the action of heat and cold, or to love and enmity
between things, or to the influence of the stars, for all things
in nature are subject alike to these three forces. Now,
“when philosophers realized that everything was wonderful,
they began to experiment and to bring forth what there is
in things.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The chief
causes of
marvels.</div>

<p>The author, for his part, cannot agree with those philosophers
and medical men who have tried to explain everything
in terms of hot and cold, dry and moist. He declares that
they met with many phenomena in the course of their experience
which they could not verify upon this basis, so that
“they marveled and were sorrowful incessantly, and often
denied something although they saw it.” On the other
hand, our author does not agree with the astrologers that
everything can be explained by the course of the stars. He
prefers the view of “Plato and Aristotle and the orthodox
(<i>legitimi</i>) and all who pursue the ultimate philosophy” that
there are diverse causes or channels of marvelousness
(<i>mirabilibus</i>). Often marvels are produced by the impression
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_734">[Pg 734]</span>
of the stars, often by heat and cold, often by the virtues
of demons and necromancers, often by virtues innate in
objects and implanted with their substantial forms, often
by the relationship of things to one another. This is why
Plato says <i>in libro tegimenti</i> (or, <i>regiminis</i>) that one who
is not trained in dialectic, natural science, astrology, and
necromancy&mdash;“in which are revealed the immaterial substances
which dispense and administer all that is in things
for good or for evil”&mdash;can explain neither what the philosophers
have written nor what the senses perceive, and will
depart sadly, unable to solve the problems of the marvelous.
Our author also warns his readers to distinguish between the
effects, often contrary, of substance and accident, and to remember
that action is sometimes direct, sometimes indirect.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Marvels
proved by
experience,
not
by reason.</div>

<p>Finally, before beginning his list of specific marvels, the
author reverts to his point concerning reason and experience,
citing the <i>liber tegimenti</i> again to the effect that some things
for which we can give no reason are nevertheless manifest
to the senses, while others which we perceive by no sense or
sensation are manifest to the reason. As usual the power
of the magnet is adduced as an example of things proved by
experience for which reason cannot account. “So no one
should deny what the philosophers have affirmed from experience
until he has tested it in the manner of the philosophers
who discovered it.” It is also pointed out that many
of the ancients told marvelous things which are now verified
and generally accepted. “And I will tell you some in order
that you may strengthen your mind on them and be prepared
to believe what reason cannot confirm.” With this the list
of particular marvels opens.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Borrowing
from the
<i>Liber
vaccae</i> of

<p>At first authorities are cited a good deal; philosophers
in general, Galen, Hermes, the Arabian medical writer <i>filius
Mesue</i> or Yuhanna ibn Masawaih,<a id="FNanchor_2358" href="#Footnote_2358" class="fnanchor">[2358]</a> the Pseudo-Aristotle
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_735">[Pg 735]</span>
and Alexander, whose feat is mentioned of killing the vipers
with the deadly glance by erecting mirrors for them to
look themselves to death in. Less familiar names are
Architas, Belbinus&mdash;who, however, is perhaps the same as
the Belenus of the <i>Speculum astronomiae</i>, Tabariensis, a
<i>Book of Decoration</i>, and the books of Archigenes and Cleopatra,
two authors cited by Galen. These same names of
authors, with precisely the same statements cited from each
and with a similar preceding argument about proving marvels
by experience, occur also in the <i>Liber vaccae</i> or <i>Liber
aggregationum anguemis</i> or <i>Liber institutionum activorum</i>,
ascribed to Plato and Galen,<a id="FNanchor_2359" href="#Footnote_2359" class="fnanchor">[2359]</a> and of which we shall treat
in a subsequent chapter. As this <i>Liber Anguemis</i> seems to
have been known to William of Auvergne and to date back
in Latin translation to the twelfth century, the <i>De mirabilibus
mundi</i> would seem to have copied from it, especially
as its citations of <i>Plato in libro tegimenti</i> (or <i>regiminis</i>),
which I suspected had some connection with Galen before
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_736">[Pg 736]</span>
I became acquainted with the <i>Liber Anguemis</i>, may be
meant for that work, of which both Plato and Galen are
reputed authors. It should be noted, however, that these
citations and the passage introductory to them are entirely
absent from one manuscript<a id="FNanchor_2360" href="#Footnote_2360" class="fnanchor">[2360]</a> of the <i>Liber vaccae</i> or <i>Liber
Anguemis</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Contents
of the
<i>Marvels</i>
characterized.</div>

<p>In the specific marvels ligatures and suspensions are
employed to a large extent, as are parts of animals: the skin
of a wolf or dog, the blood of a hare, bird, bat, or male
turtle, the urine of a mule, and the wax from a dog’s left
ear. There are a number of cures for quartan fever and
some for other diseases, and various methods are recommended
to prevent conception. The philosophers are represented
as saying that if flies are submerged in water, they
appear dead, but if they are buried in ashes, they will rise
again. <i>The Book of Cleopatra</i> advises a husband whose
wife does not love him to wear the marrow from a wolf’s
left foot, “and she will love none but you.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">A mixture
of chemistry
and
magic.</div>

<p>Toward the end of the treatise authorities are no longer
cited and many of the recipes aim at magical or optical illusions
and the fabrication of marvelous candles, lights, and
combustibles. Some are perhaps akin to modern fireworks
and chemical rather than magical. They terminate at any
rate with a recipe for Greek fire and other explosives, including
perhaps gunpowder. Instructions are given how
to make men appear headless or with three heads or with
the face of a dog or the head of an ass or any animal you
wish, or in the form of angels or black men or elephants
and great horses. Also how to write letters which can
be read only at night, how to make a chicken or other animal
dance in a dish, how to make the whole house seem
full of snakes, how to make oneself seem on fire from head
to foot, how to cast an object into the flames without burning
it, how to enable men to walk through fire or carry a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_737">[Pg 737]</span>
hot iron uninjured, how to extinguish a lamp by opening
the hands over it and how to light it by closing them. Other
recipes enable one to catch birds in the hands, to inward off
dogs and snakes, to break a love charm, to loose bonds, see
the future in sleep, catch a mole, and force a confession
from a woman. To make a man forever a eunuch one
should give him a glow-worm in drink. “And they say
that if anyone is anointed with ass’s milk, all the fleas in the
house will gather on him.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Two
specimens
of combustibles.</div>

<p>The following is a specimen of the more superstitious
type of recipe for a candle or combustible. From the first
part of the human head, called <i>sinciput</i> by the philosophers,
worms are generated soon after death. After seven days the
worms become flies and after fourteen days they are great
dragons whose bite is instantaneously fatal to man. “If you
take one of these and cook it with oil and make a candle
of it with a wick of crape, you will thereby behold
with great fear a great thing and indescribable forms.” In
contrast to this recipe may be quoted one of three for making
“flying fire” out of sulphur, charcoal, and saltpeter.
“Take a pound of sulphur, two pounds of willow charcoal,
six pounds of saltpeter. Grind them very fine on a marble
stone. Then put some in a cover of flying-paper or thunder-making
paper. The cover for flying should be long, thin,
and well filled with that powder, but for thunder-making
short, thick, and half filled.” Here we would seem to have
gunpowder and fireworks described.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Further
discussion
of marvelousness
in
general.</div>

<p>In three of the four <i>incunabula</i> editions of the <i>De mirabilibus
mundi</i> which I have examined there occurs toward
the close of the treatise another passage discussing marvelousness
in general, most of which is not contained in the
later editions although they briefly indicate its main point.
The author says that now he understands that a thing is
marvelous only as long as most persons cannot detect its
cause, and that when a sufficient cause for it is shown, everyone
ceases to wonder at it. He then distinguishes three kinds
of marvels: first, those of rare occurrence in which not only
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_738">[Pg 738]</span>
is the cause unknown but the phenomenon itself marvelous
from its very rarity; second, those whose cause is unknown,
although the phenomena are neither new nor unusual; third,
those whose cause is not entirely unknown but seems insufficient
to account for the result. To produce any marvelous
effect the requisites are a strong agent and a well-disposed
material or patient. Sometimes, even when the agent is
weak, the unusual aptitude of the patient compensates for
this. On the basis of this scholastic generalization the author
goes on to advise that, in working any marvel in the
presence of the vulgar, one should center their attention upon
some weak factor which alone is manifestly insufficient to
produce the desired result and conceal the other contributory
factors in the experiment as far as possible.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
<i>Marvels</i> is
an experimental
book.</div>

<p>If the <i>Marvels</i> is a more theoretical treatise than the
<i>Experiments</i>, it is none the less almost equally experimental
in character. Its particular marvels are also put in the form
of experiments, and even in the more scholastic and reasoned
introduction and conclusion the author, as we have seen, constantly
appeals to experience, and closely associates experimentation
and magic by such phrases as “all the marvelousness
of experiments and marvels.” He also employs the verb
<i>experimentari</i> as well as the classical form <i>experiri</i>, thus suggesting
definitely that he means “to experiment” and not
merely “to experience.” The <i>De mirabilibus mundi</i>, in fine,
as well as the <i>Experimenta Alberti,</i> belongs to the category
of “books of experiment” or “experimental books” which we
have heard William of Auvergne and the <i>Speculum astronomiae</i>
mention, and to which our next two chapters will be
further devoted. Some of the items of the <i>De mirabilibus
mundi</i> will be found duplicated or closely paralleled in these
other experimental books, as we have already noted in the
case of the <i>Liber vaccae</i> or <i>Liber Anguemis</i>, and as Berthelot,
in editing <i>The Book of Fires</i> of Marcus Grecus, noted
that a number of its experiments were found also in the
<i>De mirabilibus mundi</i>.<a id="FNanchor_2361" href="#Footnote_2361" class="fnanchor">[2361]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_739">[Pg 739]</span></p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>De
secretis
mulierum.</i></div>

<p>With the later editions of the <i>Liber aggregationis</i> and
<i>De mirabilibus mundi</i> there was usually published a third
treatise ascribed to Albertus Magnus which had already been
printed separately, namely, <i>The Secrets of Women</i>. I am
not quite sure whether this treatise was put on the <i>Index
Expurgatorius</i> because it had become too popular, or whether
its popularity was increased rather than diminished by this
official censure. At any rate the number of extant manuscripts
shows that it was well known before the <i>Index</i> was
ever instituted. Possibly one reason for questioning the authenticity
of the two treatises which we have just considered
was the ill-repute into which they came in consequence of
being so often bound with the <i>De secretis mulierum</i>. Also
its history and the question of its genuineness or spuriousness
may throw some light, if only by way of illustration and
analogy, upon the same problem in their case. Moreover, if
the <i>De secretis mulierum</i> is by Albert or one of his disciples,
it affords some further illustrations of the belief in
occult virtue and astrology of himself or his pupils; and if
not, it at least shows what a great interest such doctrines
had for a large number of readers during the centuries from
the fourteenth to eighteenth inclusive. It is not, however,
either a book of magic or an experimental book like the
two treatises which we have just considered.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The problem
of its
authorship.</div>

<p><i>The Secrets of Women</i> was printed before 1500<a id="FNanchor_2362" href="#Footnote_2362" class="fnanchor">[2362]</a> and in
all has appeared in about as many editions as the other two
treatises. Choulant counted over thirty editions of each.<a id="FNanchor_2363" href="#Footnote_2363" class="fnanchor">[2363]</a>
The <i>De secretis mulierum</i> is found in several manuscripts,
chiefly of the fourteenth century, in the medieval collection
of Amplonius at Erfurt, and in numerous other manuscripts
at Munich, Berlin, Wolfenbüttel, and Vienna.<a id="FNanchor_2364" href="#Footnote_2364" class="fnanchor">[2364]</a> Apparently
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_740">[Pg 740]</span>
the treatise originated in Germany, whether by the hand of
Albert or not, and remained a favorite there. A translation
into German was made for the Count Palatine of the Rhine.<a id="FNanchor_2365" href="#Footnote_2365" class="fnanchor">[2365]</a>
Although sometimes no author is named in manuscripts of
the <i>De secretis mulierum</i>, in the case of those of Amplonius
of the fourteenth century one infers from Schum’s descriptions
that the work is ascribed to Albertus Magnus and to no
one else. Thus no support is given by these early manuscripts
to the theory of Simlerus, Meyer, and Borgnet that
the treatise should be attributed to Henry of Saxony, a disciple
of Albert whose writings contain many excerpts from
Albert’s, because in some old printed editions the work is
assigned to him.<a id="FNanchor_2366" href="#Footnote_2366" class="fnanchor">[2366]</a> This ascription to Henry of Saxony has
already been well characterized by V. Rose in his Catalogue
of the Latin manuscripts at Berlin as “a pure invention of
the editor”<a id="FNanchor_2367" href="#Footnote_2367" class="fnanchor">[2367]</a> of the printed edition of 1499, which the manuscripts
clearly contradict. Thomas of Cantimpré, who devotes
some chapters of his <i>De natura rerum</i> to gynecology
has also been suggested as author of the <i>De secretis mulierum</i>,
but for no further reason.<a id="FNanchor_2368" href="#Footnote_2368" class="fnanchor">[2368]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Its citation
of Albert,
commentary,
opening.</div>

<p>Perhaps the best reason for doubting the authenticity of
<i>The Secrets of Women</i> is that Albert seems to be cited in it,
a point already noted by Albert’s biographer, Peter of Prussia,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_741">[Pg 741]</span><a id="FNanchor_2369" href="#Footnote_2369" class="fnanchor">[2369]</a>
towards the close of the fifteenth century. It is, however,
somewhat difficult to distinguish the text of the original
treatise from that of a commentary upon it which both
accompanies and envelopes it in both the manuscripts and
printed editions. In this commentary Albert is often cited
but apparently he also is cited in the text proper, from
which, however, the commentary after a time ceases to be
adequately distinguished in those copies which I have examined.<a id="FNanchor_2370" href="#Footnote_2370" class="fnanchor">[2370]</a>
Possibly this commentary is by Henry of Saxony
or perhaps it is the commentary by Buridan mentioned in one
of the manuscripts.<a id="FNanchor_2371" href="#Footnote_2371" class="fnanchor">[2371]</a> It states that Albert composed the
treatise at the request of a priest (<i>sacerdos</i>), and the text itself
opens with a salutation “To his dearest friend and associate
in Christ,” after which ensues a divergence, due no
doubt to the carelessness of copyists, as to the name or initial
letter of the cleric in question, as to his place of residence,
and as to his ecclesiastical rank or position.<a id="FNanchor_2372" href="#Footnote_2372" class="fnanchor">[2372]</a> But he appears
to have been a clerk from Erfurt who was studying at Paris.
The text is in the form of a letter to this clerk and the author
states that it is written “in part in physical and in part in
medical style.” He asks the clerk not to reveal it to any depraved
person and promises to send him further writings,
“when providence permitting I have toiled further in the art
of medicine.”<a id="FNanchor_2373" href="#Footnote_2373" class="fnanchor">[2373]</a> This fact that the <i>De secretis mulierum</i> is
addressed to a clerk who seems to be studying at Paris suggests
that in the fourteenth century bibliography of writings
by Dominicans the title, <i>Determinationes quarumdam questionum
ad clerum Parisiensem</i>, as well as another title,
<i>Secretum secretorum Alberti</i>, which are ascribed to Albert,
may refer to our treatise, although the exact title, <i>De secretis
mulierum</i>, does not appear in the bibliography.</p>

<p><i>The Secrets of Women</i> scarcely deserved to be placed on
the Index aside from the suggestiveness of its title and perhaps
the fact that it had become too popular. Meyer, while
regarding it as spurious, rightly remarked that it shared the
common medical knowledge of the time and displayed a
strong astrological superstition, but was neither immoral nor
indecent.<a id="FNanchor_2374" href="#Footnote_2374" class="fnanchor">[2374]</a> As a matter of fact, its astrology is little more
extreme than what we have found in Albert’s undisputed
works. The article upon him in the <i>Histoire Littéraire de
la France</i><a id="FNanchor_2375" href="#Footnote_2375" class="fnanchor">[2375]</a> declared that <i>The Secrets of Women</i> was certainly
not by him, but added that he makes very similar
statements in his commentary on the fourth book of the
<i>Sentences</i>, where he justifies such knowledge on the part of
a priest as essential to his comprehension of what he is liable
to be told in the confessional. This fits in nicely with the
statement that Albert composed the <i>De secretis mulierum</i> at
the request of a priest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Medieval
standards
in such
matters.</div>

<p><i>The Secrets of Women</i> may seem indecent judged by
modern standards, but so do many discussions of sexual
matters by monastic recluses, theologians, and church fathers
of the distant past. Peter of Prussia, Albert’s fifteenth century
biographer, although concerned to establish the saintly
character of his hero, did not question the authenticity of
the <i>De secretis mulierum</i> on grounds of indecency but
thought it “useful and necessary to know the facts of nature,
even if indecent.”<a id="FNanchor_2376" href="#Footnote_2376" class="fnanchor">[2376]</a> In the thirteenth century itself we find
a number of Latin works which are very similar to <i>The
Secrets of Women</i>. There is <i>The Secrets of Nature</i> by
Michael Scot and <i>The Adornment of Women</i><a id="FNanchor_2377" href="#Footnote_2377" class="fnanchor">[2377]</a> by Arnald of
Villanova, a physician of the closing thirteenth century who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_743">[Pg 743]</span>
also wrote on Antichrist, advocated religious reform, and
gave moral and religious exhortation as well as medical care
to his royal patients in Sicily and Aragon. This <i>De ornatu
mulierum</i> was described by the <i>Histoire Littéraire de la
France</i> as “one of Arnald’s most curious treatises, containing
very informing details concerning the arts by which medieval
women corrected the faults of nature or repaired the
ravages of age. But we say no more on this point. We
would not venture the vaguest allusion to the contents of
some paragraphs. They taught publicly in the middle ages
things which respectable persons do not know and do not
wish to know.”<a id="FNanchor_2378" href="#Footnote_2378" class="fnanchor">[2378]</a> Those who are offended at the idea of the
blessed Albert’s discussing such matters in the thirteenth
century should read the highly vivid, realistic, and matter-of-fact
account of male sexual passion in the <i>Causae et curae</i> of
St. Hildegard,<a id="FNanchor_2379" href="#Footnote_2379" class="fnanchor">[2379]</a> the mystic and ascetic, the abbess and
prophetess, in the twelfth century, in which work it follows
a long and circumstantial account of the process of conception
and generation.<a id="FNanchor_2380" href="#Footnote_2380" class="fnanchor">[2380]</a> Or they might note in a sixteenth century
manuscript at Paris that an oration by John Antony
Alatus, doctor of physic, royal and apostolic knight, delivered
when he was chosen orator to Pope Innocent, is immediately
followed by a <i>Book of the Secrets of Women</i> by the same
author.<a id="FNanchor_2381" href="#Footnote_2381" class="fnanchor">[2381]</a> Of another thirteenth century work which attained
extraordinary popularity in almost every European language
and which was most appropriately entitled, <i>De omni re scibili
et quibusdam aliis</i>&mdash;“Of everything knowable and then
some,” the <i>Histoire Littéraire</i> says,<a id="FNanchor_2382" href="#Footnote_2382" class="fnanchor">[2382]</a> “The mysteries of generation
engage its attention more than anything else; like
<i>Timeo</i> it is very detailed upon this point and often borders
upon obscenity.” A fourth work, <i>The Secret of Philosophers</i>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_744">[Pg 744]</span>
written in French by someone who at least pretends to be a
priest and doctor of theology, is also full of unprintable passages
upon sex and generation, and yet shows also, according
to the <i>Histoire Littéraire</i>,<a id="FNanchor_2383" href="#Footnote_2383" class="fnanchor">[2383]</a> the spirit of scientific philosophy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Some
superstitious
recipes.</div>

<p>Our treatise contains some superstitious recipes akin to
those of the <i>Liber aggregationis</i> and <i>De mirabilibus mundi</i>.
To prevent conception for a year women are advised to drink
salvia cooked with wine for three days; or to eat a bee, “and
she will never conceive.” If hairs of menstruating women
are buried in rich soil where ordure lies in winter time, the
sun’s heat will generate a long and strong serpent there the
following spring or summer. To tell if the child will be male
or female one should pour a drop of the mother’s milk or
blood into pure water from a clear spring. If the drop goes
to the bottom, the child will be a boy; if it floats on the surface,
a girl.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Astrology.</div>

<p>Astrology, however, is more prominent in this treatise
than such magical modes of divination. We are told that
“all the virtues which the soul comprehends in the body it
draws from the supercelestial spheres and bodies.”<a id="FNanchor_2384" href="#Footnote_2384" class="fnanchor">[2384]</a> From
the farthest sphere come the powers of being and moving.
From the sphere of the fixed stars the foetus receives its individual
personality. From the sphere of Saturn, the virtue
of discerning and reasoning; from that of Jupiter, magnanimity;
from that of Mars, animosity and irascibility; from
the sun, the power of learning and memorizing; and so on.
We are also told how each planet, starting with Saturn, rules
for a month the formation of the various physical members
of the child in the womb, and the fact that the heart is formed
during the fourth month under the rule of the sun is regarded
as disproving Aristotle’s assertion that the heart is
generated first of all the members. The influence of each
planet at birth is also recorded, and we hear of “the influences
of the planets, whom the ancients called gods of nature,
over man’s body and soul.”<a id="FNanchor_2385" href="#Footnote_2385" class="fnanchor">[2385]</a> Also that man’s intellectual
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_745">[Pg 745]</span>
power is not from matter but from the sky. Saturn’s child
is dark, hairy, well bearded, false, malicious, wrathful,
gloomy, wears unkempt clothing, and so forth. The influences
of the twelve signs are also considered, and the <i>magnus
annus</i> with its repetition of history and Socrates reliving
his life in the same old Athens. The author also declares
that divine sacrifice, immolation of beasts, and the like cannot
be removed from the action of the celestial bodies which
mete out life and death, which perhaps suggests that even
religion and prayer are under the stars. Monstrous births,
such as twins with separate heads and hands but one trunk
and pair of feet, are ascribed to some special constellation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Citations
of Albert
and Avicenna.</div>

<p>Albert is cited, perhaps by the commentator, concerning
twins of whom one had such virtue in his right side that all
bolts and locks on that side of him were opened, while the
virtue of the other’s left side closed all open doors. This
was due not only to a special constellation but to a special
disposition of matter to receive its influence. Peter of
Prussia (Cap. 12) cites the same passage from Albert’s
<i>De motibus animalium</i>. Other citations of Albert in the <i>De
secretis mulierum</i> are one from a treatise on the sun and
moon and the assertion that a child was born with organs
of either sex <i>ita quod potuit succumbere</i>. Avicenna is credited
with having stated in a book on deluges that a flood
might come and drown all living creatures, but that the virtue
of the sky would generate others.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_2335" href="#FNanchor_2335" class="label">[2335]</a> I have examined at the British
Museum four incunabula editions
containing both treatises
and numbered (at the time of my
reading) as follows: IA.6829
(<i>Impressum Auguste per Johannem
schauren feria secunda post
Bartholomei</i>, 1496); IA.46455;
IA.55455 (<i>per me Wilhelmum de

(<i>Imprime pour Thomas Laione

The text in these editions is
nearly identical except for some
divergencies in the one printed
at Rouen. The edition printed at
London is perhaps the most accurate
of the four.</p>

<p>I have not seen the following
edition: <i>Liber aggregationum sive
secretorum de virtutibus herbarum,
lapidum, et animalium</i>,
Naples, 1493-1494: nor an edition
printed at Antwerp, 1485, in
which the <i>Liber aggregationis</i> is
bound with the <i>Quaestiones naturales</i>
of Adelard of Bath. The
<i>Liber aggregationis</i> was published
with the <i>De mirabilibus mundi</i> at
Frankfurt in 1614, and with the
<i>De secretis mulierum</i> at Amsterdam
in 1643 and again in 1662,
but I have not seen these three
editions.</p>

<p>I have seen an edition of sixteen
leaves containing both <i>Liber
secretorum</i> and <i>Liber de mirabilibus
mundi</i>, Venetiis per Marchio
Sessa, 1509. Also an edition of
both these treatises preceded by
the <i>De secretis mulierum</i> and followed
by the <i>De secretis naturae</i>
of Michael Scot, Strasburg, 1607,
per Lazarum Zetzerum; an edition
of Amsterdam, 1740, containing
the same four treatises; and
an edition of Lyons, 1615, where
the <i>Speculum astronomiae</i> replaced
the work by Michael Scot.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_2366" href="#FNanchor_2366" class="label">[2366]</a> This is also suggested by the
old catalogue of Royal MSS at

Alberti Magni discipuli de secretis
mulierum, #2. Anatomia totius
corporis eodem authore,” etc.</p>

<p>The MS itself, however, affords
no ground for this attribution to
Henry of Saxony. On its cover
is written in crowded medieval
letters and with abbreviations,
“De secretis mulierum alberti,
Anathomia secundum albertum,
Expositio de lepra.” In the text
itself this last is stated to be a
gloss on Avicenna’s work on the
cure of leprosy by master Albert
“de sangaciis” or “de zanchariis”
of Bologna, a doctor of the
philosophical faculty. There
seems, however, to be nothing to
connect his name with the two
preceding treatises which respectively
open: “Incipit liber de
secretis mulierum secundum Albertum
magnum,” and “Incipit
Anathomia tocius corporis secundum
Albertum Magnum.” A
Nicolaus has signed his name as
scribe or copyist of the <i>Anatomy</i>
and <i>De lepra</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Books of
“experiments”
or
“secrets.”</div>

<p>In this chapter we continue our examination of the pseudo-literature
current in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries by
considering and distinguishing one from another a number
of books of “experiments” or “secrets” which are mainly
medicinal in character, although some are concerned especially
with the properties of animals, and most of which are
attributed either to Rasis or Galen or to both of them. Some
were included in the early printed editions of their works,
others are found frequently in medieval Latin manuscripts.
Some of them perhaps really are by Rasis or have some connection
with his works. In the next chapter we shall go on
to books of experiments primarily of a chemical and magical
character but some of which also are ascribed to Rasis
or Galen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rasis on
pains in
the joints.</div>

<p>It is essential to distinguish these various treatises from
one another rather carefully, because a number of different
writings are ascribed to Galen or Rasis under the common
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_752">[Pg 752]</span>
title of “Book of Experiments” or words to that effect.<a id="FNanchor_2386" href="#Footnote_2386" class="fnanchor">[2386]</a>
Thus Gilbert of England, a medical writer of the first half
of the thirteenth century, cites “the expert experiments from
Galen’s book of experiments” for the statement that ammonia
is a remedy for pains in the joints,<a id="FNanchor_2387" href="#Footnote_2387" class="fnanchor">[2387]</a> while a fifteenth
century manuscript at Berlin, containing various extracts
from medical works, cites “a certain experimenter of whom
Rasis writes in the book of experiments, ‘He cured many
afflictions by simple medicines.’”<a id="FNanchor_2388" href="#Footnote_2388" class="fnanchor">[2388]</a> We may first note that
the title <i>Liber experimentorum</i> or <i>Experimenta Rasi</i> is sometimes
applied to what is probably a genuine work of Rasis,<a id="FNanchor_2389" href="#Footnote_2389" class="fnanchor">[2389]</a>
namely, the treatise <i>On diseases of the Joints</i> (<i>De egritudinibus
juncturarum</i>), which appears in both early printed
editions of Rasis’ works.<a id="FNanchor_2390" href="#Footnote_2390" class="fnanchor">[2390]</a> I think that this treatise sometimes
is found alone in the manuscripts,<a id="FNanchor_2391" href="#Footnote_2391" class="fnanchor">[2391]</a> but more often it
is followed by, or run together with, as if they formed a
single work, another treatise or portion of a treatise which
more properly deserves the title, <i>Book of Experiments</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Medical
Experiments</i>
of
Galen or
Rasis.</div>

<p>This is the book of medicines tested by experiment or of
medical experimentation<a id="FNanchor_2392" href="#Footnote_2392" class="fnanchor">[2392]</a> or of experiments of the altar. It
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_753">[Pg 753]</span>
constantly talks about experimenters and its contents are arranged
as experiments. The work opens with the statement
that the fire which descended upon the altar burnt the books
of the king or kings, and with these numerous medical works,
including some which the author himself had begun to compose.
This faintly suggests the fire of 192 A. D. mentioned
by Galen which destroyed the shrine of Peace and the libraries
on the Palatine hill and the first two books, which
had already been published, of his own work on compound
medicines. It might therefore seem that the present treatise
is that of a forger trying to pass himself off as Galen, and
in the printed text of 1481 and many manuscripts this opening
statement is introduced by the words, “Said Galen.” In
other manuscripts there is no such mention of Galen and the
treatise is ascribed to Rasis, like the work on diseases of the
joints which so often precedes it. Between these two works
there often intervenes a brief treatise or chapter on the medical
treatment of children (<i>Practica puerorum</i> or <i>parvorum</i>).
Where the <i>Medical Experimentation</i> comes to an end is not
easy to determine. It might seem to be brought to a close
by a sentence reading, “Said Galen”&mdash;or, “Says Rasis”&mdash;“Now
we have said our say in this book which we call the
book of the experimental testing of medicines, which we
have proved and have received from wiser men.” But after
some further lines of text, which scarcely seem the beginning
of a new treatise, we meet in some editions or manuscripts
with an “Explicit” or “Expliciunt experimenta Galenis,”
while in others the text proceeds without a break, although
this sentence occurs, “Now moreover, of those medicines
we have mentioned in this treatise many tested by experience,
but if we acquire yet others, we will write them at
the end of this treatise.” This would seem to indicate that
the work is not yet finished. The text then often continues,
as we have said, discussing such matters as “How to take
medicine without nausea; marvelous pills according to Rasis,”
“Medicines which beautify the face,” “The composition
of many oils,” soporifics invented by Rasis to cure his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_754">[Pg 754]</span>
own insomnia brought on by too intense application to the
medical art, and other remedies for varied complaints. In
the 1497 edition of Rasis’ works, which does not contain
the <i>Medical Experimentation</i> proper, most of this supplementary
material was combined in four chapters under the
separate title, <i>The Antidotarium of Rasis</i>,<a id="FNanchor_2393" href="#Footnote_2393" class="fnanchor">[2393]</a> although that
title apparently belongs to another work, while a passage on
the stone was also printed as a distinct <i>Tractatus Rasis de
preservatione ab egritudine lapidis</i>. But in the 1481 edition
and such manuscripts as I have examined these chapters or
paragraphs are not separated from the <i>Medical Experimentation</i>,
and the whole finally ends, “Expliciunt experimenta
rasis.” Possibly, therefore, everything that we have noted
so far, beginning with the <i>Diseases of the Joints</i>, should be
regarded as part of a composite treatise by Rasis, whose name
occurs most often and prominently. If so, it is a very omnibus
work and loosely hung together, nor when its parts are
found together are they always in the same sequence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Value
of such
medical
experiments.</div>

<p>If we consider that portion which may be described as
the <i>Medical Experimentation</i> proper, we find that the
Pseudo-Galen, or whoever he is, goes on to say that he does
not grieve so much over the loss of other books in the fire
as he does concerning some medical experiments which were
there and which he had acquired from certain good experimenters
(<i>a quibusdam bonis viris experimentatoribus</i>). For
a single one of those experiments he may have had to give
in exchange several good experiments of his own or perhaps
a considerable sum of money. Sometimes a man may make
a fortune and get a name for great learning by knowing just
one experiment which will cure a single disease. Such men
are very reluctant to impart their secret to others and sometimes
it dies with them. Having thus secured the reader’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_755">[Pg 755]</span>
sympathy, attention, and interest, the author discloses the
fact that, despite his losses in the fire which descended upon
the altar, he still has some experiments left. He affirms that
he has composed the present work of medicines tested by his
own experience or received from good medical men, and that
he does not fill up his book with familiar remedies like tyriac
and opiates, but introduces medicines whose existence is generally
unknown.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Experimenters
of many
lands and
cities.</div>

<p>Our author then proceeds to list one medical compound
after another, giving its ingredients and method of preparation,
its effects on various parts and processes of the human
body, and the diseases which it cures. Sometimes he explains
the properties and operation of each constituent. He
usually gives the name and city of the experimenter from
whom he received the prescription, but these proper names
are difficult to decipher, as they vary in the printed editions
and manuscripts<a id="FNanchor_2394" href="#Footnote_2394" class="fnanchor">[2394]</a> and are often abbreviated and probably
misspelled in both. Thus “the experiments of Yrini pigami
romani” are perhaps the same as “the experiments of Urcanus
Romanus” which Gilbert of England cites for some
pills for sciatica.<a id="FNanchor_2395" href="#Footnote_2395" class="fnanchor">[2395]</a> However, we seem to read of Sacon or
Socion, “the greatest of Greek medical men,” whose experiments
our author gets from his disciples; of Gargeus or
Agarges, who was the lord of all the wise men of his time;
of Cateline, physician to King Lithos; and of other physicians
and medicines from Egypt, Macedonia, and Sicily.
Often a number of experiments are taken from a single authority;
eleven from Gereon the Greek which our author has
put to the test and found to be truly marvelous; thirty by
Athaharan, an experimenter of the city of Abthor, some of
which our author apologizes for as well known; three compound
and thirty simple medicines by Achaason, an experimenter
of the city of Athens; twenty from Zeno of Athens, a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_756">[Pg 756]</span>
great physician whom our author says he had never seen because
not contemporary with him, but that his master had
seen him and got good experiments from him and passed
them on to our author who has proved them oftentimes and
found them true. Our author especially esteems the physicians
of the altars, who are reputed superior to other medical
practitioners because they cure by means of the sacrificial
meats. Of a medicine which he received “from an Egyptian
stranger,” he exclaims that it has not its like and that this
stranger had it from one of the physicians of the altars.
These allusions suggest that our author is a pagan, perhaps
a Sabian like Thebit ben Corat, rather than a Mohammedan
or Christian, but are perhaps a dodge of the forger
like his opening allusion to the fire which descended on the
altar&mdash;suggestive of fire-worship in Rasis’ own Persia.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Who was
the Latin
translator?</div>

<p>In several manuscripts<a id="FNanchor_2396" href="#Footnote_2396" class="fnanchor">[2396]</a> the treatise which we have just
been discussing is ascribed to Galen rather than Rasis and
is said to have been translated from Greek into Arabic by
John or Johannitius, that is, by Honein ben Isʿhak or Hunain
ibn Ishak, or Hunayn ibn Ishaq, a Christian Arab who died
in 873,<a id="FNanchor_2397" href="#Footnote_2397" class="fnanchor">[2397]</a> and from Arabic into Latin by a Franchinus or
Farachius or Ferranus or Ferrarus or Frarthacius. Steinschneider<a id="FNanchor_2398" href="#Footnote_2398" class="fnanchor">[2398]</a>
has explained the spellings, Franchinus, Farachius,
Faragut, Fararius, and Ferrarius, as all applying to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_757">[Pg 757]</span>
Faradj ben Salem, a Jew of Girgenti who was connected
after 1279 with Charles of Anjou as a translator. This
Jew, commonly called Faragius or Feragius in the Latin
manuscripts, translated the <i>Continens</i> of Rasis<a id="FNanchor_2399" href="#Footnote_2399" class="fnanchor">[2399]</a> and the
medical treatise entitled <i>Tacuinum Dei</i>.<a id="FNanchor_2400" href="#Footnote_2400" class="fnanchor">[2400]</a> But can he be identified
with the Ferrarius whom De Renzi<a id="FNanchor_2401" href="#Footnote_2401" class="fnanchor">[2401]</a> classed among the
medical writers of the school of Salerno and whose works
are found in a manuscript dated as early as the twelfth century?<a id="FNanchor_2402" href="#Footnote_2402" class="fnanchor">[2402]</a>
Also our treatise would seem to have been translated
into Latin by the first half of the thirteenth century,
since there are several manuscripts of it from that century,
and since Gilbert of England cites either it or the Rasis on
pains of the joints which regularly accompanies it. Perhaps
Faragius made a re-translation, apparently not an uncommon
occurrence in the medieval period. It is also worth recalling
that Peter the Deacon listed among the works translated by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_758">[Pg 758]</span>
Constantinus Africanus a <i>De experimentis</i>. Can this have
been the treatise ascribed to Galen or Rasis, and can Franchinus
and the other names possibly be corruptions of Africanus?
But this is not all. Just as Galen and Rasis have
ascribed to them both medical works and works of alchemy,
so one manuscript contains “Extracts from the treatise on
the art of alchemy of brother Ferrarius,” who, like that other
friar inclined to alchemy, Roger Bacon, “directs his letter
to the Pope.”<a id="FNanchor_2403" href="#Footnote_2403" class="fnanchor">[2403]</a> Nor do these extracts seem to agree with
the treatise in alchemy of Efferarius which has been printed,<a id="FNanchor_2404" href="#Footnote_2404" class="fnanchor">[2404]</a>
although he too is described as a monk who addresses <i>apostolicum
quendam</i>.<a id="FNanchor_2405" href="#Footnote_2405" class="fnanchor">[2405]</a> Probably, however, the same alchemist
is meant in both cases, but it also seems probable that in general
there was more than one writer named Ferrarius. But
from the perplexing problems of who was the translator of
the <i>Medical Experiments</i> and of the identity or different personality
indicated by Ferrarius and other similar names let
us turn to another work attributed to Galen.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The
Secrets
of Galen.</i></div>

<p>The <i>Secrets of Galen</i>, or <i>The Book of Secrets</i>, is a treatise
which seems to occur with fair frequency in the manuscripts<a id="FNanchor_2406" href="#Footnote_2406" class="fnanchor">[2406]</a>
and has also appeared in print.<a id="FNanchor_2407" href="#Footnote_2407" class="fnanchor">[2407]</a> It is perhaps most
found with other works of Galen, but also occurs in manuscripts
containing experimental books, and in particular the
<i>Medical Experiments</i> of Galen or Rasis just considered, or
in manuscripts with other works of Rasis. Gerard of Cremona
is often mentioned in the manuscripts as the translator
of the work from Arabic into Latin, and such a translation is
included in the list of Gerard’s works drawn up by his associates
soon after his death.<a id="FNanchor_2408" href="#Footnote_2408" class="fnanchor">[2408]</a> At the close of the treatise occurs
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_759">[Pg 759]</span>
this statement: “Says Hunayn, son of Isaac, ‘This is
what we have found from the books (or, book) of Galen for
the use of the religious, and it is more glorious and blessed
than his other books, and of aid, so that if another book
were lost, I could supply it from this one.’”<a id="FNanchor_2409" href="#Footnote_2409" class="fnanchor">[2409]</a> This statement
seems to indicate that this treatise, like the <i>Medical Experiments</i>,
had first been translated from the Greek to the
Arabic by Honein ben Ishak, or perhaps rather that Honein,
who was a Christian Arab, has made a compilation of extracts
from the works of Galen for the use of persons of
religion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Addressed
to “friend
Monteus.”</div>

<p>The opening words of the treatise are: “You have asked
me, O friend Monteus, to write you a book on the cure of
diseases in accordance with experimental medicine and rational
considerations from those numerous cases which I
have wisely tested of good men of religion in the service of
the king (or, in the observance of the Faith).”<a id="FNanchor_2410" href="#Footnote_2410" class="fnanchor">[2410]</a> That these
remarks are not the preface of a translator but the words of
the original author is indicated not only by the fact that in at
least one manuscript<a id="FNanchor_2411" href="#Footnote_2411" class="fnanchor">[2411]</a> they are called, “The words of Galen,”
but also by the fact that, after the writer has made a few
general medical observations and allusions to his other writings
on the elements, on aid to the limbs, on disease and
accidents, and on compound medicines, he again addresses
“brother Montheus” under the caption, “Words of Galen
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_760">[Pg 760]</span>
commending his book.”<a id="FNanchor_2412" href="#Footnote_2412" class="fnanchor">[2412]</a> Montheus is now told that “this is
the book of great assistance which I composed in medicine,
for I have tested all its contents many times in similar constitutions.”
Galen, or whoever the writer may be, regards
this treatise as supplementing and rectifying his work on
compound medicines. In yet a third passage “friend Monteus”
is told of an “alcohol” which keeps the eyes in good
condition which the writer has used.<a id="FNanchor_2413" href="#Footnote_2413" class="fnanchor">[2413]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Was he
William
of Saliceto’s
“friend
Montheus”?</div>

<p>But here occurs a difficulty, for we find William of Saliceto,
the noted Italian surgeon of the thirteenth century,
opening his work on surgery with the words, “My intention
is, friend Montheus, to publish for you a work on manual
operation in order to satisfy the petition of our associates.”<a id="FNanchor_2414" href="#Footnote_2414" class="fnanchor">[2414]</a>
It would therefore appear either that William’s work on surgery
is a mere translation of some earlier treatise, or that
William is also largely responsible for the so-called <i>Secrets
of Galen</i>, and that he has throughout added new material
and remarks of his own to those of Honein and the genuine
or pseudo-Galen. This would not surprise us, for we have
evidence that he was not the first to take such liberties with
the work of Galen and Honein. Moses Maimonides, the
Jewish writer of the twelfth century, says in his Aphorisms
that in the treatise of Hippocrates on diseases of women,
upon which Galen commented and which Johannitius translated,
he has found many interpolations of a marvelous character
“which some other person than Johannitius wrote and
some other person than Galen expounded.”<a id="FNanchor_2415" href="#Footnote_2415" class="fnanchor">[2415]</a> But it would
be difficult to explain why our treatise in the manuscripts is
quite generally said to have been translated into Latin by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_761">[Pg 761]</span>
Gerard of Cremona, while William of Saliceto is never mentioned.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Patients
and prescriptions.</div>

<p>The <i>Secrets</i> describes the writer’s treatment of such ills
as stupor and chills, frenzy, headache, sore eyes, white
growths in the eyes, earwigs, earache, bones stuck in the
throat, nosebleed. His patients are likewise regularly mentioned
and include old men of seventy and young men of
twenty, one of the sons of the kings, a king’s daughter, “a
man from the kings of Alexandria,” and another “man from
kings,” orators, and “a man from one of the villas of the
Romans” who was troubled with sciatica. He also describes
pills for pains in the joints which he made for his young
friend Glaucus,<a id="FNanchor_2416" href="#Footnote_2416" class="fnanchor">[2416]</a> a philosopher of Beneventum.<a id="FNanchor_2417" href="#Footnote_2417" class="fnanchor">[2417]</a> But he
tells especially, as he had been asked to do, of his prescriptions
for monks and ascetics, both men and women, who had
ruined their health by their austerities.<a id="FNanchor_2418" href="#Footnote_2418" class="fnanchor">[2418]</a> Be he Honein or
Gerard of Cremona or William of Saliceto, the writer has
no false modesty and says of his “alcohol” for the eyes, for
instance, “This is the last word, and a great secret.” His
recipes, however, are the usual sort of compounds and are
limited to medicinal purposes, so that there is no reason for
us to dwell upon them further.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Liber
Medicinales
de
Secretis
Galieni.</i></div>

<p>From its title one might think that a <i>Medicinal Book of
the Secrets of Galen</i> in an Oxford manuscript<a id="FNanchor_2419" href="#Footnote_2419" class="fnanchor">[2419]</a> would turn
out to be the same treatise as the foregoing, but upon examination
it is found to consist chiefly of the medicinal virtues
of animals and parts of animals, beginning with man. The
names of the animals are given in a foreign language, which
is probably meant to be Arabic, and the text is accompanied
by a series of spirited little miniatures of the animals in the
margin, ending with the transmarine eagle. The work
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_762">[Pg 762]</span>
rather resembles that of Sextus Placitus on medicine from
animals which precedes it in this manuscript and which we
have discussed in an earlier chapter.<a id="FNanchor_2420" href="#Footnote_2420" class="fnanchor">[2420]</a> The closing chapters
of our text deal with the four humors. The superstitious
and fantastic uses to which the parts of animals are put is
indicated by the opening words of the treatise, “Bind on the
tooth of a dead man.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rasis <i>On
sixty
animals</i>.</div>

<p>A very similar work on sixty animals is ascribed to Rasis
in the 1497 edition of his works, and Albertus Magnus cites
“the book of sixty animals” to the effect that the flesh of the
dog is hot and dry.<a id="FNanchor_2421" href="#Footnote_2421" class="fnanchor">[2421]</a> In reality in the treatise as it has reached
us, only fifty-six animals are discussed, the first being the
lion, and the fifty-fifth and fifty-sixth, man and woman.<a id="FNanchor_2422" href="#Footnote_2422" class="fnanchor">[2422]</a>
Most of the animals treated are equally familiar, but some
names have been left in Arabic. The work does not describe
the animals and their habits, still less draw moral lessons
or spiritual illustrations from them, but limits itself to their
medicinal properties, or in a few cases, such as ants or mad
dogs, to remedies against their bites. Much of the contents
is of the same sort as Pliny’s discussion of the medical virtues
of parts of animals, but the few authorities cited are
Arabic or Greek,&mdash;Aristotle, Dioscorides and Galen. The
work is very superstitious. With the right eye of a hedge-hog
and other ingredients an eyewash is made which is supposed
to enable one to see in the dark, while if the left eye of
the same animal is fried in oil and a little of it inserted in a
person’s ear on the point of a stylus, he is supposed to drop
off to sleep at once.<a id="FNanchor_2423" href="#Footnote_2423" class="fnanchor">[2423]</a> Eating a frog is recommended as a restraint
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_763">[Pg 763]</span>
upon sexual passion and upon conception.<a id="FNanchor_2424" href="#Footnote_2424" class="fnanchor">[2424]</a> It is said
that everyone will be terrified who enters a house that has
been sprinkled with the water in which the animal called
<i>iaroboath</i> has been drowned.<a id="FNanchor_2425" href="#Footnote_2425" class="fnanchor">[2425]</a> If a man’s tooth and a hoopoe’s
wing are suspended over a sleeper, he will not awake
until they are removed.<a id="FNanchor_2426" href="#Footnote_2426" class="fnanchor">[2426]</a> To cure tertian or quartan fever
one places on the back of one’s neck with the left hand a
powder made of a spider who has been captured while in the
act of catching flies, pulverized, and stored in linen.<a id="FNanchor_2427" href="#Footnote_2427" class="fnanchor">[2427]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Eberus <i>On
the virtues
of animals</i>.</div>

<p>Very similar to, indeed perhaps in large measure identical
with one or the other of the two foregoing treatises or with
the <i>De medicina ex animalibus</i> of Sextus Placitus, judging
from the description of it given by Valentinelli, is a work on
the virtues of about seventy animals in a manuscript of the
fifteenth century at Venice.<a id="FNanchor_2428" href="#Footnote_2428" class="fnanchor">[2428]</a> Like the work of Sextus
Placitus it opens with “the little beast which some call the
<i>taxo</i>.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Galen and
Honein
<i>On Plants</i>.</div>

<p>To Galen was ascribed not only the work on the occult
medicinal virtues of animals already noted, but also a like
treatise on plants.<a id="FNanchor_2429" href="#Footnote_2429" class="fnanchor">[2429]</a> It was translated from the Arabic into
Latin by <i>Grumerus Index de Placentia</i> (Grumerus, a judge
of Piacenza) and Master Abraham the physician, and is in
the form of a Gloss or Commentary by Honein ben Ishak or
Johannitius, whom we again encounter as the translator or
adapter of Galen from the Greek. Honein states that Galen’s
wish in this work was to set down some medicines of marvelous
properties which he had collected in the course of his
lifetime, and which Honein too has often put to the test,
“and experience never fails.” These medicines are not commonly
known, because Galen wished them divulged only to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_764">[Pg 764]</span>
men of wisdom and discretion. Others, however, before
Honein have translated the treatise from Greek into Arabic,
and a preceding glossator has dealt with it in a way of which
Honein does not approve and which he intends to rectify, including
only what is true and what he has himself tested.
Forty-six specimens are then treated, of which a few are
stones or parts of animals rather than plants.<a id="FNanchor_2430" href="#Footnote_2430" class="fnanchor">[2430]</a> Honein’s
gloss is mainly devoted to explaining what plant or tree
Galen had in mind in each case, or, where Galen does not
give an exact name, to stating its Arabic equivalent. In a
few cases the opinion of Abraham the Jew is briefly added.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Secrets</i>
or <i>Aphorisms</i>
of
Rasis.</div>

<p>To Rasis is attributed not only a work on animals much
like that ascribed to Galen; there also is a <i>Book of Secrets
in Medicine</i> printed under his name.<a id="FNanchor_2431" href="#Footnote_2431" class="fnanchor">[2431]</a> But to avoid confusion
with the two books of secrets ascribed to Galen, we shall
henceforth speak of Rasis’ treatise by its alternative title of
<i>Aphorisms</i>. The following is a literal translation of its
preface, interesting for its attitude to science and books, and
both original and at the same time occasionally a bit incoherent
and abrupt or strange and mystical in tone. Perhaps
these characteristics are to be partly accounted for by awkwardness
of the Latin translator in grappling with the
Arabic, or, if we assume that the work is by Rasis, to the
coming on of old age, or perhaps they are merely the mystic
and boastful style characteristic of pseudo-literature.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A literal
translation
of its
preface.</div>

<p>“I have collected and classified diseases, and I have shown
cures and the natures of cures from the canons of the ancients
and from treatises and chapters to the best of my ability;
and I beseech God to supply me with the additional
strength and power to complete this book and make it a useful
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_765">[Pg 765]</span>
one. Already we have completed a compilation of things
tested by experience in the arts, namely, philosophy and
physics, two subjects in which words and facts are infinite.
And men can never make an end of those subjects (<i>Nec
etiam homines in eis complementum habere possunt</i>.) But
our intention in this book is to show things useful to humanity.
And in this we differ from the ancients who hid
things that were essential to know and deprived of light the
path of science and virtue. And witness to this point is our
big book of divine science, which is the Book of Spirituals,
and our book Of the Spirit. And our discussion in the
Book of Diets, namely, how indulgence may be removed
from these for all time. And I have condensed the language
so that one can get to the point more easily. And I expect
retribution from God who will furnish me aid. For without
Him nothing has effect.”</p>

<p>“Says Abu Bekr: the wise man is not occult and in every
age, despite frauds and concealments of the paths of science
and of the ancient arts, compilers have collected their doctrines
and discovered their ways whether hidden or manifest.
And this book of ours is first and is secret and is handy. And
show it not to undeserving persons. In it is contained reason,
it adds something to the ancients, and as long as there shall
be days and years I shall live and gain through this book of
mine, and I have no doubt that this book of mine is something
secret. For it has been my plan to tell some secrets in
it, both in prognostics of the future and in confidential information
and some of my own cases. Said confidences I
acquired and collected from the books of sages who had
not perfectly revealed them. And from what I have experienced
myself and acquired by my reason. And witness
thereof is my rational language, and I have spoken in collections
of medicines and foods, and I want to strike a golden
mean between these and free my words entirely from the accidental.
And know that this is the pith of all utility and
the pearl of clarity which brings light out of darkness.
Which book the ancients would have praised had they lived
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_766">[Pg 766]</span>
till now, and I have divided it into six chapters without superfluity;
with comprehensiveness and brevity I now begin
to speak with my excessive virtue and occult science.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Contents
of its six
chapters.</div>

<p>The first chapter on prognostics deals with the weather as
a sign or cause of disease and also with bodily symptoms.
The next two chapters on experiments, confidences, and Rasis’
own cases, contain some close resemblances to two treatises
already described in this chapter, listing marvelous oils,
plasters, confections, and suffumigations like the latter part
of the <i>Experimental Medicines</i> of Galen or Rasis, making
the same citations of Haly, and giving Rasis’s prescription
for his own insomnia; and also the alcohol (here spelt <i>alcofol</i>)
for white growths of the eyes of the <i>Secrets of Galen</i>,
which is again called “the last word” (<i>Scias quod hoc est
ultimum</i>). The fourth chapter speaks of the great force of
occult virtues in natural substances, the difficulty of measuring
and comprehending such occult virtue, and the consequent
need of moderation and caution in the use of medicines
and the danger of rash experiment. The author’s advice
that “of medicines everyone should take less” was certainly
sound amid the extravagances of ancient and medieval pharmacy.
He gives an interesting list of drugs which may
safely be employed.<a id="FNanchor_2432" href="#Footnote_2432" class="fnanchor">[2432]</a> The fifth chapter, after a brief introduction
by Rasis, consists of the <i>Secrets</i> or <i>Prognosticon</i> of
Hippocrates, which we have already met following or in the
midst of the <i>Experimental Medicines</i> of Galen. The sixth
chapter is a collection of miscellaneous aphorisms such as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_767">[Pg 767]</span>
that in the practice of medicine “Laymen and those would
judge by their intuition and young men who have not had
practical experience are no better than murderers,”<a id="FNanchor_2433" href="#Footnote_2433" class="fnanchor">[2433]</a> and
that “women who are accustomed to sleep a great deal on
the right side will hardly bear a female child.” In both the
sixth and second chapters the need of a doctor’s knowing
astronomy and the importance of observing the planets and
the moon are touched on. Appeals for divine aid and the
rendition of thanks to God occur occasionally throughout
the treatise.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Experimentator.</i></div>

<p>Withington states in his <i>Medical History</i> that Rasis
was sometimes called <i>Experimentator</i>. Now among the
many medieval “experimental books” was one which is cited
simply as <i>Experimentator</i> by two thirteenth century
writers, Petrus Hispanus, afterwards Pope John XXI, in his
<i>Thesaurus Pauperum</i>,<a id="FNanchor_2434" href="#Footnote_2434" class="fnanchor">[2434]</a> a medical compendium of great popularity,
and Thomas of Cantimpré in his encyclopedia entitled
<i>De natura rerum</i>.<a id="FNanchor_2435" href="#Footnote_2435" class="fnanchor">[2435]</a> In his preface Thomas describes
<i>Experimentator</i> as “a book without name of the author,
which I have heard was compiled in modern times.”<a id="FNanchor_2436" href="#Footnote_2436" class="fnanchor">[2436]</a> No
manuscript of a work so entitled seems to be extant. The
citations of Thomas and Peter from the work deal largely
with animals, their habits and semi-human characteristics,
and the virtues medicinal and otherwise of various parts of
their carcasses. <i>Experimentator’s</i> prescriptions included eating
the heart of a wolf and the gall of a bear, taking a powder
compounded of the burnt hoof of an ass, the ashes of a
weasel, and swallows burnt alive, touching an aching tooth
with that of a dead man, and even more disgusting remedies.
Some of these suggest the <i>Sixty Animals</i> of Rasis, but it will
be remembered that that treatise did not touch upon the
habits of the animals but only their medicinal uses. Moreover,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_768">[Pg 768]</span>
Peter of Spain cites herbs and other non-animal remedies
from <i>Experimentator</i> for paralysis of the tongue,
toothache, and constipation, while Thomas of Cantimpré
repeats “the properties of air according to <i>Experimentator</i>.”
Thomas does well to speak of the book as <i>compiled</i> in modern
times, for many of its statements have a familiar sound
and suggest use of such authors as Pliny and Marcellus Empiricus.
For instance, Thomas cites <i>Experimentator</i> for the
account found in Pliny’s <i>Natural History</i>&mdash;and described by
Pliny himself as an “experiment”&mdash;of marking a dolphin’s
tail in order to learn its age, if it should chance to be caught
again. On the whole, if neither Peter nor Thomas knew
who wrote the <i>Experimentator</i>, it is probably idle for us to
make surmises, unless possibly it may have been by Thomas
himself, whose authorship even of the <i>De natura rerum</i> is
seldom recognized either in the manuscript catalogues or in
the manuscripts themselves.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Experiments</i>
of
Nicholas
of Poland
and Montpellier.</div>

<p>Of medieval collections of experiments which are medicinal
in character we may further include some which do
not fall under the head of pseudo-literature but are ascribed
to a writer of the thirteenth or early fourteenth century.<a id="FNanchor_2437" href="#Footnote_2437" class="fnanchor">[2437]</a>
Such are “The Experiments of Brother Nicholas, a physician
of Poland, who was at Montpellier thirty (or, twenty) years
and who had such efficiency (or, was a man of so great experience)
that neither before him is there believed to have
been his like, nor is it hoped for the future, as is patent in
his marvelous works in divers provinces and regions in easily
expediting great and sudden cures.”<a id="FNanchor_2438" href="#Footnote_2438" class="fnanchor">[2438]</a> Nicholas is here
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_769">[Pg 769]</span>
spoken of as “brother” because he was a Dominican friar.
In one manuscript this Nicholas of Montpellier is further
called “de Bodlys.” Serpents are used a great deal in his
experiments. Thus to break the stone in the reins or bladder
he recommends that the patient drink a little “snake-dust”
(<i>pulverem serpentis</i>)<a id="FNanchor_2439" href="#Footnote_2439" class="fnanchor">[2439]</a> in wine early in the morning and late
at night. Or a pulverized toad or scorpion would be even
more efficacious.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His <i>Antipocras</i>.</div>

<p>In one manuscript the <i>Experiments</i> of Nicholas are immediately
followed by his <i>Antipocras</i> or <i>Book of Empirical
Remedies</i>.<a id="FNanchor_2440" href="#Footnote_2440" class="fnanchor">[2440]</a> This work, in form a poem with a prose prologue,
in content is in part an invective against the physicians
of the Hippocratic school, who, whether on rational grounds
or from motives of professional jealousy, have questioned
the marvelous cures which Nicholas has wrought by unusual
pills or drugs, or by external applications in rings and
brooches. In part it is a listing of these empirical methods,
ligatures and suspensions, employment of occult virtues and
amulets, by means of which Nicholas asserts that he has
wrought so many marvelous cures, and which he declares
are based on repeated experiment and solid experience,
whether they seem reasonable <i>a priori</i> or not. He assails
the authority of Galen who said, “Physician, how can you
cure, if you are ignorant of the cause?” He makes much of
the doctrine of occult virtues in many things, and “more in
despised than in precious and famous things.” As authorities
in his support he cites Tobias, Ptolemy, Hermes and
“master Albert.” The magnet, as usual, is brought forward
as a proof of the existence of occult virtue.</p>

<p>A treatise entitled, <i>Fates of the Stars</i>, is ascribed to a
Nicholas of Poland in a manuscript at Munich, but if the
date given, 1477 A. D., be that of composing the treatise,

from Syriac into Arabic, the
Arabic version being then revised
by Hunayn, who, however, sometimes
translated directly from
Greek into Arabic. All three languages
were known to most of

as Leclerc suggests, that
whether the translation was made

whether it was primarily designed

</div>

<p class="h3sub">THE MANUSCRIPTS OF THE MEDICAL EXPERIMENTS</p>

<p>The <i>Medical Experimentation</i> is printed in the 1481 edition
of Rasis but not in that of 1497. It also is found in old
editions of Galen, such as that of Venice, 1609, VIII, Spurii
libri, fols. 108v-113v; and that of Renatus Charterius, Paris,
1679, X, 561-70.</p>

<p>It occurs frequently in the MSS. In the following list
I have endeavored to indicate the other treatises accompanying
it, since they are perhaps all sections of one work. I
note first those MSS which I have personally examined.</p>

<div class="hangingblockquote">

<p>St. John’s College 85, late 13th century, fol. 157v-, “Incipiunt
experimenta rasi. Dicit rasis volo in hoc capitulo dicere medicinas
que sunt necessarie in doloribus iuncturarum scilicet
medicinas laxativas” ... (the Incipit of the De egritudinibus
iuncturarum): fol. 167r-, “De experimentis altaris. Dixit G.
quod ignis qui descendit ...” (the Incipit of the De medicinis
experimentatis): fol. 172v-, “De aptatione medicine ut sine horribilitate
possit sumi secundum Rasim pillule mirabiles”: fol. 178v,
“Expliciunt experimenta rasis. amen dicant omnia.” Steinschneider
(1905), p. 12, was in error in describing the “experiments”
of Rasis in this MS as alchemistic; nor do I understand
why he said (1906), p. 47, “Ein medizinisches liber Experimentorum
von Razi ist sonst kaum bekannt; wenn St. Johns
Coll. 85 ein solcher enthält, so ist wohl der Titel neu,” especially
since he himself some pages later (1906), p. 85, associates with
the name of Rasis a lib. Experimentorum in Wolfenbüttel 479,
fols. 304-16.</p>

<p>Arundel 115, 1327 A. D., fol. 108v-, Practica puerorum; fol. 110-,
Tractatus de iuncturis dolorum curatione; fol. 116v-, Liber experimentorum;
fol. 121r- De aptatione medicine ut sine horribilate
sumi secundum Rasim pillule mirabiles; fol. 125r, “Expliciunt
experimenta rasys. deo gratias.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_772">[Pg 772]</span></p>

<p>Sloane 1933, 13th century, fol. 99r-, Antidotarium of Rasis, some
50 or 60 chapters from diseases of the scalp to sciatica, opening
and closing, “Iam quidem pervenimus ad expositionem resonis
... / ... imspissetur deinde repone. xplicit antidotarium
rasi”: fol. 105v-, “Incipiunt experimenta rasi. Dixit rasis volo
in hoc capitulo....” The MS is imperfect, if not mutilated:
at fols. 111-12 it seems to run into the Practica puerorum and
at fol. 114v stops in the midst of the De medicinis experimentatis.</p>

<p>BN 7046, 13th century, following the Divisiones and Antidotarium
of Rasis come at fol. 157-, Rasis de iuncturarum egritudinibus;
fol. 165-, Practica puerorum; fol. 169-, Experimenta seu ipsius
seu Galeni.</p>

<p>BN 6906, 14th century, following the Antidotarium, at fol. 164r-,
de iuncturarum egritudinibus; fol. 175r, “Explicit practica parvorum.
Incipiunt experimenta;” fol. 188r, “Explicit experimenta
rasis.”</p>

<p>Other Paris MSS where the Diseases of the Joints and Medical
Experiments are joined together as a single work are BN
6902, fols. 106-129v; 6903, fols. 75r-92r; 6904, fols. 141r-159v:
all of the 14th century. In BN 6902, fol. 117r, the caption,
“Here Rasis begins to tell various experiments which he acquired,”
precedes the usual Incipit of the Medical Experiments,
“Said G(alen) Fire descended on the altar....” In the other
two MSS the usual Incipit occurs alone and there is no rubric
or break in the text to mark it.</p>
</div>

<p>The following MSS I have not seen:</p>

<div class="hangingblockquote">

<p>BN 6893, 14th century, #3 Rhazis experimenta de doloribus juncturarum;
#4 Galeni liber de medicinis experimentatis sive experimentatio
medicinalis e graeco sermone in arabicum a Johannicio
et ex arabico in Latinum a Magistro Franchino conversa.</p>

<p>Balliol 285, 13th century, fol. 198, Liber Galieni de medicinis experimentatis
qui intitulatur experimentatio medicinalis quem
transtulit Johannes de Greco in Latinum (Arabicum?) et magister
Farachius de Arabico in Latinum; Incipit, “Dixit Galenus
ignis qui descendit....”</p>

<p>CLM 372, 15th century, fol. 185-, Galeni liber ... “experimentatio
medicinalis” quem transtulit Johannicius de Greco in arabicum
et mag. Ferranus de arabico in latinum.</p>

<p>CLM 666, 15th century, fol. 288-, Excerptum ex Galeni libro de
medicinis experimentatis a magistro Ferraro translato.</p>

<p>CLM 19901, 15th century, fol. 209-, Liber Ga(leni) de medicinis
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_773">[Pg 773]</span>
experimentatus qui intitulatur experimentatio medicinalis quem
transtulit Johannicius de Graeco in Arabicum et mag. Frarthacius
de Arabico in Latinum.</p>

<p>Merton College 228, 14th century, fol. 51-, Avicennae liber experimentorum,
interprete Gerardo Cremonensi, but the Incipit shows
it to be the De medicinis experimentatis, “Dixit Galienus; ignis
qui descendit....” It is interesting to note that it is preceded
by the Divisiones of Rasis and followed by his work to Almansor,
which are the only other treatises in the MS and are also
said to be translated by Gerard of Cremona.</p>

<p>Amplon. Folio 260, 13-14th century, fols. 344-52, experimenta de
doloribus juncturarum, fols. 355-66, Galieni experimentatio
medicinalis (ab aliis Rasi attributa).</p>

<p>Amplon. Folio 265, early 14th century, fols, 111-19, liber experimentorum
Rasis, fols. 121-26, de cura dolorum iuncturarum
Rasis. It is unusual for the <i>Cure of Pains in the Joints</i> to follow
the other treatise.</p>

<p>Berlin 899, 13th century, fol. 89-, Experimenta, or, De doloribus
iuncturarum; fol. 96-, Liber G. experimentationis medicinarum.
This MS also has the usual supplementary matter beginning
with the “De aptatione medicine ut sine horribilitate possit sumi,”
etc., although just before this another hand has inserted the
word “Explicit” and drawn a red line.</p>

<p>CU Trinity 1473, 15th century, fols. 116-31, Experimenta rasis,
opens, “Dixit rasis volo in hoc capitulo ...” (the Incipit of the
Diseases of the Joints), closes, “... per vias urinales” (the
Explicit of Rasis’ passage on the cure of the stone) “Expl.
antidota.” (over an erasure) “Rasi et cum hiis totus libellus Deo
gracias.”</p>

<p>Peterhouse 101, 13-14th century, fols. 98v-116, is like the MS just
described, except that it closes “... per vias urinales. Expl.
experimenta Rasis,” and then follows the Antidotarium of Rasis.</p>

<p>CLM 3520, 14th century, fol. 61-, Liber experimentorum Rasis,
fol. 63-, Medicinae Zenonis de Athenis, is presumably simply
a part of the former, since it includes twenty experiments or
recipes by Zeno of Athens.</p>

<p>CLM 13026, 14th century, fol. 1, Liber de secretis G(alen)i; but
the Incipit, “Dixit G; ignis qui descendit ...” is that of the
Experiments.</p>

<p>Wolfenbüttel 2156, 15th century, fols. 427-35, Experimenta varia
Rasis, Vsion Rision (qui erat de Armenia anteriori), Asariton,
Anuleth de Macedonia, Acharaan de civitate Apthor, aliorumque
medicorum. These seem to be some of the authorities cited in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_774">[Pg 774]</span>
the Medical Experiments. The same MS also contains Rasis’
Divisiones and a part of the Secrets of Galen of which we shall
speak later.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The <i>Liber
Vaccae</i>.</div>

<p>Of the books of experiments of a chemical or magical character
which we have to consider in this chapter the earliest,
as far as our available information goes, is the <i>Liber Vaccae</i>,
with which the name of Galen is associated and which is
primarily a collection of magical and necromantic experiments.
The original author, however, was the philosopher
Plato whose work, according to a long, rambling, and confused
prefatory statement, Galen had revised and abbreviated.
Steinschneider held that our treatise was cited under
the title <i>Liber de prophetiis</i> by Pedro Alfonso in the <i>Disciplina
clericalis</i> at the close of the eleventh century,<a id="FNanchor_2442" href="#Footnote_2442" class="fnanchor">[2442]</a> but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_778">[Pg 778]</span>
perhaps Pedro knew it in Arabic or Hebrew<a id="FNanchor_2443" href="#Footnote_2443" class="fnanchor">[2443]</a> rather than
Latin translation. The manuscripts of the Latin translation,
however, go back to the thirteenth, if not to the twelfth
century,<a id="FNanchor_2444" href="#Footnote_2444" class="fnanchor">[2444]</a> while for most of the other treatises to be considered
in this chapter the oldest extant manuscripts seem to
be of the fourteenth century. Moreover, William of
Auvergne refers to our treatise in his work written in the
first half of the thirteenth century.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its other
titles.</div>

<p>The work has many other alternative titles besides <i>Liber
Vaccae</i>, which seems to be suggested by its first experiment
which is concerned with a cow, and <i>Liber de prophetiis</i>,
which I do not remember to have seen in any Latin manuscript.
Another common title is <i>Liber Anguemis</i> or
<i>Anequems</i> or <i>Anegnems</i> or <i>Anagnenis</i>,<a id="FNanchor_2445" href="#Footnote_2445" class="fnanchor">[2445]</a> although the preface
explains that the treatise was not called the <i>Liber Anguemis</i>
in the first place. The manuscripts also call it <i>The Book of
Active Institutes</i> and <i>The Book of Aggregations of Divers
Philosophers</i>. William of Auvergne spoke with disapproval
of our treatise as a book of mixtures employed in
magic, which was ascribed to Plato and called <i>Liber Neumich</i>
or <i>Nevemich</i>, or the <i>Laws</i> of Plato. “And,” adds
William sarcastically, “it is called the <i>Laws</i> of Plato because
it is contrary to the laws of nature.”<a id="FNanchor_2446" href="#Footnote_2446" class="fnanchor">[2446]</a> Steinschneider has
pointed out that in Arabic <i>Nawamis</i> means “laws” and that
both <i>Neumich</i> and <i>Anguemis</i> are probably Latin corruptions
of the Arabic word. And of course <i>Laws</i> and <i>Institutes</i> are
practically the same thing. Pico della Mirandola, writing
against astrology at the close of the fifteenth century, refers
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_779">[Pg 779]</span>
to our treatise by the two titles <i>De vacca</i> and <i>Institutes</i>, warning
his readers that astrologers palm off their volumes as
the writings of great authorities like Aristotle, “just as
magicians carry about the books of Plato <i>De vacca</i> and
what they call the <i>Books of Institutes</i>, stuffed with execrable
dreams and figments.”<a id="FNanchor_2447" href="#Footnote_2447" class="fnanchor">[2447]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Its two
prologues.</div>

<p>Honein ben Ishak again appears in connection with a
supposititious work of Galen. The long and repetitious prefatory
statement, to which we have already alluded, is professedly
by him, and we are told what Honein said and what
Galen said and what Honein says Galen said in great profusion.
The Latin translator, however, not to mention
subsequent copyists, has perhaps taken liberties with the
wording of this preface and corrupted an original Arabic
clarity. Who the Latin translator is we are not told, but in
some manuscripts the prefatory statement to which we have
thus far alluded is proceeded by an even longer prologue
which opens with the pious wish, “May God confer noble
morals upon you.” This is probably the same as a prologue
by “Farachius” opening, “Friend, may God grant you noble
morals,” which Steinschneider held belonged with the <i>Medical
experiments</i> of Galen or Rasis.<a id="FNanchor_2448" href="#Footnote_2448" class="fnanchor">[2448]</a> But our prologue seems
to contain a direct allusion to the following <i>Liber vaccae</i><a id="FNanchor_2449" href="#Footnote_2449" class="fnanchor">[2449]</a>
as well as to be generally appropriate to it. The name of
the writer of this first prologue is not given in the manuscripts
I have seen, but he refers to his books concerning
animals and poisons and simple medicines, which last is also
called the <i>Book of Sustenance</i> (<i>liber sustentationis</i>). He
appears to have been criticized for his propensity toward
marvels and occult virtues and his inconsistency in at the
same time censuring vulgar suspensions, incantations, and
cures. His defense of occult properties is the usual one
that even if reason cannot account for them, they are supported
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_780">[Pg 780]</span>
both by the testimony of the ancients and by experience.
As usual the property of the magnet is adduced; the
Pseudo-Aristotle is cited “in his books on stones,” and the
genuine Aristotle in the <i>History of Animals</i> concerning the
narce’s power of stupefying. The remainder of the prologue
consists chiefly of a series of citations from various
authors which are largely duplicated in the <i>De mirabilibus
mundi</i> ascribed to Albertus Magnus. This first prologue
cannot be by Honein, since it cites not only Costa ben Luca
but <i>filius messie</i>, that is, Yuhanna ibn Masawaih who died
at Cairo in 1015, or some Latin writer of the eleventh
or twelfth century who pretended to translate his works
from the Arabic. Presumably therefore it is by the Latin
translator of the <i>Liber vaccae</i>. This could not be Faradj
ben Salem under Charles of Anjou if the translation was
known to William of Auvergne early in the thirteenth century.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Experiments
in
magic generation
and rainmaking.</div>

<p>The experiments of the <i>Liber vaccae</i> are hardly such as
can be described in detail in English translation. Some of
them are elaborate experiments in unseemly generation and
obstetrics, having for their object “to make a rational animal”
from a cow or ape or other beast,<a id="FNanchor_2450" href="#Footnote_2450" class="fnanchor">[2450]</a> or “to make bees.”<a id="FNanchor_2451" href="#Footnote_2451" class="fnanchor">[2451]</a>
By a similar procedure a liniment is obtained which has such
virtue that if one is anointed with it, one feels no pain from
blows, while it blunts the edge of a sword with which one is
struck. Or by suffumigations with it rain may be produced.<a id="FNanchor_2452" href="#Footnote_2452" class="fnanchor">[2452]</a>
A less unmentionable method of rain-making is that which
is “famous among the wise” and which, the author says,
some employ in his own time. First a black crow without a
speck upon it is to be “submerged in water until it dies.”
Then a very black dog is to be imprisoned in a dark house
and given the crow to eat and the water in which it was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_781">[Pg 781]</span>
drowned to drink on the third day. By the eleventh day,
we are assured, only the whites of his eyes will show and
he will be unable to bark. Then one takes a small tree called
<i>mephus</i> with small leaves like rue and a flower like the bean,
and gives the dog about an ounce of its juice, which will
cause him to recover his voice and bark mightily. He should
then be bound “hand and foot” (<i>manus et pedes</i>) and boiled
in a big pot. The broth thus obtained is to be used to bring
rain.<a id="FNanchor_2453" href="#Footnote_2453" class="fnanchor">[2453]</a> Other procedures are described to stop a rainy spell
and restore fine weather.<a id="FNanchor_2454" href="#Footnote_2454" class="fnanchor">[2454]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">More
magic
with
animals</div>

<p>In order to see spirits a white cock with a round crest
which is concave in the middle is put in a place where neither
the bark of a dog nor the voice of a crow is heard, whereby
this experiment is sharply distinguished from the dog-and-crow
procedure. For three successive days the cock is to
be fed on the eyes of three fish of the species known as
<i>alliataiu</i>, and the eyes must have been removed while the
fish were living. On the third day the cock will swell up
and become aggressive and his crest will grow inflamed.
After three hours he is to be decapitated and fed to a wild
cat, which is then to be beheaded in its turn. Its blood and
gall are to be dried and from them a concoction is to be prepared
which will enable one to see spirits.<a id="FNanchor_2455" href="#Footnote_2455" class="fnanchor">[2455]</a> A frog figures
as an ingredient in a mixture which, if one merely writes
with it on parchment and throws the same into a den of
snakes or vipers, will excoriate and kill them instantly.<a id="FNanchor_2456" href="#Footnote_2456" class="fnanchor">[2456]</a> The
congealed blood of an ass is a constituent of a suffumigation
which enables one to learn what the future holds in store of
good or evil.<a id="FNanchor_2457" href="#Footnote_2457" class="fnanchor">[2457]</a> Indeed throughout the work parts of animals
are the favorite substances employed, although stones and
herbs are also used.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_782">[Pg 782]</span></p><div class="sidenote">Other
marvelous
experiments.</div>

<p>The <i>Liber Vaccae</i> abounds in suffumigations, marvelous
houses, golden or otherwise, and magic lamps and fires. One
makes men appear in any form desired;<a id="FNanchor_2458" href="#Footnote_2458" class="fnanchor">[2458]</a> another makes a
house seem to be full of snakes;<a id="FNanchor_2459" href="#Footnote_2459" class="fnanchor">[2459]</a> or a lamp is extinguished
by opening the hands over it and is relighted by closing
them.<a id="FNanchor_2460" href="#Footnote_2460" class="fnanchor">[2460]</a> Such marvels we shall find frequently repeated in
our following books of experiments. That of holding fire
in the hand and not being burnt by it is here described as if
quick-lime were used rather than alcohol.<a id="FNanchor_2461" href="#Footnote_2461" class="fnanchor">[2461]</a> Other paragraphs
tell how to plant seed and have it grow instantly,<a id="FNanchor_2462" href="#Footnote_2462" class="fnanchor">[2462]</a>

recipe calls for the teeth, nose, and bones of a dead man.
But perhaps we have sufficiently illustrated the character of
the <i>Liber Vaccae</i>. Its necromancy should have at least
“provoked the silent dust” of Plato and of Galen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Plato
as an
alchemist.</div>

<p>To Plato and Galen, though never apparently again in
partnership, were also attributed various works of alchemy
in the middle ages. Most widespread would seem to have
been <i>The Fourth Book</i> or <i>Four Books</i>, which is found both
in the manuscripts and in print. In an Oxford manuscript<a id="FNanchor_2466" href="#Footnote_2466" class="fnanchor">[2466]</a>
it opens by Thebit, presumably ben Corat, asking Hasam to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_783">[Pg 783]</span>
“tell us briefly what you have learned of the revelation of
things occult and expound the book of old Plato.” Thebit
also introduces both of the other parts of the book in this
manuscript, but for the most part Hames tells us what Plato
said. This indirect form of presentation is somewhat similar
to that of the <i>Liber Vaccae</i>, and there is also much talk
of abbreviating even in the fuller and different printed version,<a id="FNanchor_2467" href="#Footnote_2467" class="fnanchor">[2467]</a>
which is divided into four books, but the contents
are entirely alchemical and there is no mention of Galen.
The work seems to be a translation from the Arabic and not
a Latin forgery. Berthelot placed the Latin translation of
the alchemical treatise of the Pseudo-Plato about 1200.<a id="FNanchor_2468" href="#Footnote_2468" class="fnanchor">[2468]</a> But
there are in the manuscripts yet other works of alchemy ascribed
to Plato, one of which, <i>The Thirteen Keys of Greater
Wisdom</i>, is said to have been translated from Arabic into
Latin about 1301 A. D.<a id="FNanchor_2469" href="#Footnote_2469" class="fnanchor">[2469]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Galen
as an
alchemist</div>

<p>As for Galen, a <i>Commentary of Galen upon Hermes’
Book of Secrets</i><a id="FNanchor_2470" href="#Footnote_2470" class="fnanchor">[2470]</a> turns out to be an alchemy of the incoherent
and mystical variety. A <i>Practice in the Secrets of
Secrets of Nature</i> ascribed to him is obviously spurious,
since it opens by citing Geber. It is accompanied by a
<i>Theorica</i>.<a id="FNanchor_2471" href="#Footnote_2471" class="fnanchor">[2471]</a> Indeed, the <i>Practica</i> is really the same as the
treatise usually ascribed to Archelaus.<a id="FNanchor_2472" href="#Footnote_2472" class="fnanchor">[2472]</a> There was perhaps
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_784">[Pg 784]</span>
a medieval alchemist named Galen, since a manuscript at
Paris states that “Master Galienus the writer who is used
in the episcopate is an alchemist and knows how to whiten
<i>eramen</i> so that it is as white as ordinary silver.”<a id="FNanchor_2473" href="#Footnote_2473" class="fnanchor">[2473]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
<i>Eighty-eight
Natural
Experiments</i>
of
Rasis.</div>

<p>The <i>Eighty-eight Natural Experiments</i> of Rasis<a id="FNanchor_2474" href="#Footnote_2474" class="fnanchor">[2474]</a> are
not medical but a series of magic tricks and chemical experiments.
Yet they are not only ascribed to Rasis, or at least
are said to be a selection from a larger work of his recently
translated from Arabic into Latin at Toledo,<a id="FNanchor_2475" href="#Footnote_2475" class="fnanchor">[2475]</a> but the translator
seems to be the same mysterious Ferrarius<a id="FNanchor_2476" href="#Footnote_2476" class="fnanchor">[2476]</a> of the
<i>Experimental Medicines</i>, while the opening words<a id="FNanchor_2477" href="#Footnote_2477" class="fnanchor">[2477]</a> are very
similar to those of the <i>Secrets</i> of Galen which Gerard of
Cremona is supposed to have translated, except that here
we read, “You have asked me, friend Anselm” instead of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_785">[Pg 785]</span>
Monteus.<a id="FNanchor_2478" href="#Footnote_2478" class="fnanchor">[2478]</a> Only fragments of the treatise seem to be extant
but enough of the eighty-eight experiments are preserved to
illustrate their character. Serpents are assembled at a given
spot by placing a snake in a perforated pot about which a
slow fire is built in order to make him hiss and attract his
kind. Fish are made to congregate similarly beneath the
surface of a river by letting down into the water at night
a lighted lantern with glass windows in its four sides.<a id="FNanchor_2479" href="#Footnote_2479" class="fnanchor">[2479]</a>
The property of alcohol (<i>aqua ardens</i>) of burning on the
tip of a finger or from a cloth which has been dipped in it
without consuming the cloth or burning the finger is termed
magical. To cook an egg in cold water, it is placed in quick-lime
in a vessel, then cold water is poured in and the vessel
tightly closed. Other experiments are to make a ring hop
about the house like a locust, to carry live coals without
injury, to light a candle from the rays of the sun, to blacken
the face completely. More useful seem those experiments
which consist in making alcohol, turpentine, or Greek
fire.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Liber
ignium</i> of
Marcus
Grecus.</div>

<p>Following the three experiments just mentioned, in both
the manuscripts of the <i>Eighty-eight Natural Experiments</i>
which we have just been describing, comes <i>The Book of
Fires for Burning Enemies</i> of Marcus Grecus.<a id="FNanchor_2480" href="#Footnote_2480" class="fnanchor">[2480]</a> Since it is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_786">[Pg 786]</span>
also found in other manuscripts,<a id="FNanchor_2481" href="#Footnote_2481" class="fnanchor">[2481]</a> it would appear to be a
distinct treatise from the <i>Eighty-eight Natural Experiments</i>,
although its form is similar. Berthelot already has been
impressed by the close association in this treatise of “purely
scientific compounds of combustible or phosphorescent substances
and the preparations of prestidigitateurs and
magicians.”<a id="FNanchor_2482" href="#Footnote_2482" class="fnanchor">[2482]</a> For instance, in an effort to make an inextinguishable
fire glow-worms are pulverized and mixed with
other substances and then warmed for a certain number
of days in horse manure.<a id="FNanchor_2483" href="#Footnote_2483" class="fnanchor">[2483]</a> A lamp that will shed a silvery
light on everything in the house is obtained by smearing the
wick with a liquid similar to quicksilver supposed to be obtained
by cutting off a lizard’s tail.<a id="FNanchor_2484" href="#Footnote_2484" class="fnanchor">[2484]</a> Or everything around
will appear green, if the brain of a bird is wrapped in cloth
and burned with olive oil on a green stone. If the hands are
rubbed with an Indian nut or chestnut and “water of
camphor,” a candle may be extinguished by opening them
above it and relighted by closing the hands.<a id="FNanchor_2485" href="#Footnote_2485" class="fnanchor">[2485]</a> Other ointments
are said to keep one from being burned by a flame or
by the red-hot iron in the ordeal.<a id="FNanchor_2486" href="#Footnote_2486" class="fnanchor">[2486]</a> More scientific are the
recipes for oil of sulphur, gunpowder, Greek fire, alcohol.<a id="FNanchor_2487" href="#Footnote_2487" class="fnanchor">[2487]</a>
Two of the more fantastic experiments are said to have been
discovered by Aristotle for Alexander,<a id="FNanchor_2488" href="#Footnote_2488" class="fnanchor">[2488]</a> and another cites
Hermes and Ptolemy for its “prodigious and marvelous
works.”<a id="FNanchor_2489" href="#Footnote_2489" class="fnanchor">[2489]</a> The reader will have noticed the recurrence of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_787">[Pg 787]</span>
some of the matters treated in the <i>Natural Experiments</i> of
Rasis. Such repetitions and resemblances are common in
the medieval collections of recipes and experiments.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Further
experiments.</div>

<p>At the close of the <i>Book of Fires</i> of Marcus Grecus, in
one of the two manuscripts<a id="FNanchor_2490" href="#Footnote_2490" class="fnanchor">[2490]</a> where it follows the <i>Eighty-eight
Natural Experiments</i> of Rasis, the listing of experiments
of the same sort continues without any new title and
the consecutive numbering of them in the margin goes on
up to one hundred and forty-four in all. It is doubtful, however,
how far we may regard these additional experiments
as a resumption of the text of Rasis, which had been interrupted
by the work of Marcus Grecus, since we cannot arrive
at an even number of eighty-eight experiments by any combination.
These additional experiments instruct us how
to paint an image on the wall from which a candle may be
lighted, how to write letters that cannot be read unless the
material upon which they are written is placed near a fire
or touched with a rod, how to make cooked meat seem raw
and wormy.<a id="FNanchor_2491" href="#Footnote_2491" class="fnanchor">[2491]</a> This trick, which is found frequently in
medieval manuscripts, is performed by making mince meat
of the heart or dried blood of some animal and strewing the
particles upon the piece of cooked flesh, whose heat will
make them move like worms, while their color is that of
raw meat. We are also instructed how to cook meat of a
sudden, how to turn a red rose white&mdash;apparently by fumigating
it with sulphur, and how to make “marvelous bottles”
(<i>ad faciendum ampullas mirabiles</i>)&mdash;the directions seem to
tell how to blow soap bubbles.<a id="FNanchor_2492" href="#Footnote_2492" class="fnanchor">[2492]</a> How to emit fire from the
mouth, to heat a bath, to construct an artificial mill in a
camp, and to make all the bystanders appear headless.<a id="FNanchor_2493" href="#Footnote_2493" class="fnanchor">[2493]</a> A
score of experiments are concerned with colors and dyes.<a id="FNanchor_2494" href="#Footnote_2494" class="fnanchor">[2494]</a>
To make a dog follow you, place a piece of bread and butter
under your armpit, “that it may receive the odor of the
sweat,” and then feed it to the dog.<a id="FNanchor_2495" href="#Footnote_2495" class="fnanchor">[2495]</a> A magical experiment
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_788">[Pg 788]</span>
to deprive a man of his urine consists in taking urine and
earth on which someone has made water and enclosing them
together in the skin of a camel’s womb or a dog’s paw; “and
he will have no urine as long as the earth is enclosed in
the skin.”<a id="FNanchor_2496" href="#Footnote_2496" class="fnanchor">[2496]</a> The last experiment, “that a wife may live a

it was perhaps composed in England in the thirteenth
century. At any rate it claims no connection with Galen
or Rasis. It is longer than most medieval collections of
experiments and subdivides into seven sections, each named
after one of the liberal arts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Experiments
connected
with
writing.</div>

<p>Under the heading “Grammar” materials and instruments
used in writing are first spoken of, then methods of
writing, especially those employed by the wise to conceal
their meaning, as when the alchemists use the names of
planets to denote the seven chief metals. Instructions are
given for making colors employed in illuminating, ink, white
tablets, and glues. We are told again how to write letters
which are invisible until touched with a rod or exposed to
fire. Also how to write so that the writing can be read only
in a mirror, how to erase writing without leaving any mark,
how to engrave steel and other metals, and how to color the
letters so engraved. A paragraph on the right way of speaking
might seem to belong under the head of rhetoric rather
than of grammar, but just precedes the section of rhetoric
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_789">[Pg 789]</span>
in such manuscripts as I have examined. It warns against
much speaking, citing Aristotle’s advice to Alexander in
the <i>Secret of Secrets</i>, and ends with the familiar couplet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“If you would be wise, observe my five commands,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What you say, where, of whom, to whom, and when.”<a id="FNanchor_2504" href="#Footnote_2504" class="fnanchor">[2504]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Riddles: a
trick with
a knife.</div>

<p>The section on “Rhetoric,” which is defined as speaking
ornately, is devoted to riddles, verbal deceits, quibbles, and
catches. Under one of its sub-heads, Of Weights, we are
told how to balance a knife, although its center is to project
beyond the edge of a table and although a weight is to be
hung on this projecting end. “The way to fulfill the doctrine
of this thing is to fix the blade of the knife in the end
of a rod so that it makes an acute angle with the rod, and
you will see how the rod will hang with the knife.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Deceiving
the
senses.</div>

<p>“Dialectic” is concerned in our treatise not with logical
fallacies but with deception of the senses by various tricks.
To make water look and taste like wine, a bottle half full
of water should be held or left inverted for a time over the
orifice of a jar of wine. This procedure is recommended
in cases where a patient wants to drink wine and the doctor
knows that it would not be good for him. In order to determine
whether a patient is really dead and to prevent cases
of burial alive, it is recommended to hold a mirror to his
nostrils and see if it will be clouded by a faint breath. This
comes under the sub-head, <i>De olfactus deceptione</i>, breathing
as well as the sense of smell evidently being included under
the olfactory organs. The sense of hearing is deceived
by an echo, and the sense of sight by mirrors which enlarge
or multiply objects or make an image appear outside the
mirror. The use of burning glasses is also discussed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tricks of
jugglers.</div>

<p>Under the sub-head, “Sophistries called sleight-of-hand,”
(<i>De sophisticationibus que vocantur iugulationes</i>), come the
tricks or <i>cautelae</i> of the jugglers. An apple is made to move
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_790">[Pg 790]</span>
on a table by preparing a hole in the center beforehand and
placing a beetle inside. To construct a cross that will seem
to turn to right or left automatically in answer to questions
put to it concerning hidden or future matters, one builds
it up of wax about the tail of some insect or tiny animal<a id="FNanchor_2505" href="#Footnote_2505" class="fnanchor">[2505]</a>
which is also concealed in wax and irritated with sage<a id="FNanchor_2506" href="#Footnote_2506" class="fnanchor">[2506]</a> so
that it wiggles its tail and the cross. Hands that have been
bound may be freed by cutting the rope against a prearranged
knife. Again we meet the experiments to make cooked meat
seem raw or full of worms and directions for blowing soap-bubbles,
a process which is spoken of as “making a golden
sphere appear flying in the air.” Other illusions under
“Dialectic” are to seem on fire and not be burned, to see
stars in the daytime by multiplying the reflections of the sun,
to make a silver coin seem copper, and to deceive the sense
of touch by such methods as holding an object between two
crossed fingers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mathematical
problems.</div>

<p>The headings, Arithmetic, Music, and Geometry, are
more exactly appropriate to their contents than Dialectic
was. One problem in arithmetic is to tell how many knights,
esquires, and pages will be required to divide twenty loaves
of bread, if each knight receives two loaves, if two pages
share a loaf, and if four esquires share a loaf. Under
geometry are calculated surfaces, the cubic contents of various
receptacles, and the altitudes of inaccessible objects.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Astronomy:
experiments
with air:
the
magnet.</div>

<p>Under “Astronomy” the rule of superiors over inferiors
is affirmed and the various attributes, properties, and effects
of the planets are listed. Then come “experiments with air”
and many figures of vessels partly filled with water or other
liquids. Siphoning is explained under the heading, “Of the
ascent of water on account of the consumption of the air
lest a vacuum be left.” By employing the same principle
that Adelard of Bath observed in the magic water-jar of
the enchantress, any one of four different liquids that the
spectators choose can be poured from a single faucet. Inside
the jar are four compartments each with its own airhole
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_791">[Pg 791]</span>
above and outlet below, and beneath all four a common
chamber into which they open and from which the
common faucet pours. The four air-holes are covered with
the fingers, and as one of these is raised, the liquid will flow
from the corresponding compartment. This is illustrated
by a diagram of the contrivance. The magnet is discussed
under “Astronomy” “because it bears in itself a likeness of
the sky.” This discussion of the magnet and some of the
accompanying figures resemble the treatise of Peter Peregrinus
on the magnet, which was written in the thirteenth
century.<a id="FNanchor_2507" href="#Footnote_2507" class="fnanchor">[2507]</a> Here the work ends in two of the three manuscripts
which I have used,<a id="FNanchor_2508" href="#Footnote_2508" class="fnanchor">[2508]</a> but in the third further experiments
are added.<a id="FNanchor_2509" href="#Footnote_2509" class="fnanchor">[2509]</a> Some of these have occurred before in
the <i>Secretum philosophorum</i> itself, or in other experimental
treatises of which we have already spoken. Others are to
make fireworks,<a id="FNanchor_2510" href="#Footnote_2510" class="fnanchor">[2510]</a> to soften steel, to drive away crows, and
to tell whether a person is a leper.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Le Secret
aux philosophes.</i></div>

<p>Not to be confused with the Latin <i>Secretum philosophorum</i>,
which we have just described and which seems to
be of English origin, is a work in the French vernacular
written at the end of the thirteenth century and entitled <i>Le
Secret aux philosophes</i>.<a id="FNanchor_2511" href="#Footnote_2511" class="fnanchor">[2511]</a> It is not a collection of experiments
but rather an encyclopedic discussion of theological
and metaphysical as well as natural problems in the form
of a dialogue, presumably imaginary, although sometimes
represented as a translation, between Placides, the promising
son of a petty king, and his master Timeo, who chose
him as his pupil in preference to the stupid son of a great
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_792">[Pg 792]</span>
emperor. Through this medium is retailed for less learned
perusal much of the knowledge and superstition, especially
astrological, to be found in the Latin and Arabic learning
of the time. Perhaps the resemblance is greater to the
<i>Secret of Secrets</i> of the Pseudo-Aristotle than to any other
treatise that we have considered. The author, very weak
and meager on theological and metaphysical matters, shows
a much greater interest in natural science and something
of the spirit of experimental research. Yet in a prologue
“the compiler” gives his name as Jehan de Bonnet, priest,
doctor of theology, and native of Paris. Ernest Renan
was impressed by the curiosity shown concerning problems
of natural science, by the “search after realities” and by
the experimental spirit of the book. The solutions, as in
the <i>Natural Questions</i> of Adelard of Bath, often make one
smile, but “this naïve composition ... is superior to many
scholastic treatises in Latin which deal purely with abstractions
and where modern thought has not its true antecedents.”
In this treatise, on the other hand, “the science of
reality has taken the upper hand” and “the idea of research
is born.”<a id="FNanchor_2512" href="#Footnote_2512" class="fnanchor">[2512]</a> But Renan was mistaken in thinking such scientific
curiosity a new thing as late as the close of the thirteenth
century, and perhaps on that account overestimated
its importance in this case.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Natural
Experiments
of
Solomon.</i></div>

<p>Returning to books of experiments, we may note a treatise
whose contents are very similar to the <i>Eighty-eight
Natural Experiments</i> of Rasis, the <i>Book of Fires</i> of Marcus
Grecus, and the <i>Secretum philosophorum</i>, namely, <i>Some experiments
which King Solomon composed because of his love
for, and the imploring of, a most excellent queen, and they
are experiments of nature</i>.<a id="FNanchor_2513" href="#Footnote_2513" class="fnanchor">[2513]</a> Instead of the experiment with
the snake in the pot we now have rats in a cage, whose
squealing when a fire is heated is supposed to attract other
rats. Again we are told how to write invisible letters, how
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_793">[Pg 793]</span>
to make a candle burn in water,<a id="FNanchor_2514" href="#Footnote_2514" class="fnanchor">[2514]</a> how to light a candle from
the mouth of an image painted upon the wall. This is done
by painting the mouth with sulphur and turpentine and applying
the wick of the candle to it just after the candle has
been blown out and before it has quite ceased to glow.
Quicklime as well as sulphur and turpentine are used in an
image that will illuminate and take fire when water is poured
over it. Quicksilver is placed with saltpeter and sulphur
inside a ring in order that it may hop about when put near
a fire.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Experiments
without
title or
author.</div>

<p>Such experiments sometimes occur without any title as
well as without name of author, as in a manuscript where
there are a dozen leaves filled with them between the treatise
on plantations and the experiments or secrets ascribed to
Albert.<a id="FNanchor_2515" href="#Footnote_2515" class="fnanchor">[2515]</a> Again we encounter the jumping ring, the cooked
meat turned raw, men made to appear headless, and artificial
thunder which seems produced by use of gunpowder. There
is much discussion of colors and alchemy and we are told
how to make <i>sal ammoniac</i> and “the best bitumen.”<a id="FNanchor_2516" href="#Footnote_2516" class="fnanchor">[2516]</a> But
the virtues of herbs and animals are not forgotten and many
of the experiments are medical or magical. Instructions
are given for making a white crow by tampering with the
crow’s egg, and how to make human hair grow again by
the application of the ashes of a mole, burned in a new pot,
mixed with honey. A cure for diarrhoea is to drink milk in
which a glowing iron has been quenched. Suspending the
tongue of a goose over a sleeper has the appropriate effect
of causing him to reveal all his secrets, while the suspension
of the head of a bat prevents his waking. The bearer of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_794">[Pg 794]</span>
the herb <i>aristologia</i> is safe from demons whether awake or
asleep. To escape from chains one should employ an incantation
which contains allusions to the rescue of the apostle
Peter from the sea and from prison.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Twelve
experiments
with
snakeskin
of John
Paulinus.</div>

<p>Frequently found in the manuscripts are twelve experiments
with pulverized snakeskin which John Paulinus or
John of Spain excerpted from the book in Arabic of the
physician or physical scientist, Allchamus or Alchanus or
Alanus or Alganus, or whatever his name may have been,<a id="FNanchor_2517" href="#Footnote_2517" class="fnanchor">[2517]</a>
a book entitled <i>Life-Saver</i> (<i>Salus vitae</i>).<a id="FNanchor_2518" href="#Footnote_2518" class="fnanchor">[2518]</a> This work, as
John further informs us at its beginning, he discovered
when he “was in Alexandria, a city of the Egyptians.”<a id="FNanchor_2519" href="#Footnote_2519" class="fnanchor">[2519]</a>
Steinschneider listed this John Paulinus as a different person
from the well-known twelfth century translator, John
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_795">[Pg 795]</span>
of Spain, but at least in one manuscript<a id="FNanchor_2520" href="#Footnote_2520" class="fnanchor">[2520]</a> he is called both
John of Spain and John Paulinus.<a id="FNanchor_2521" href="#Footnote_2521" class="fnanchor">[2521]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Marvelous
virtues of
snakeskin.</div>

<p>Another manuscript<a id="FNanchor_2522" href="#Footnote_2522" class="fnanchor">[2522]</a> presents our treatise under the
amusing caption, “Twelve experiments with snakeskin and
some of them true.” All due credit should be given for
such partial scepticism but it might well have been made
more sweeping. The snakeskin is to be pulverized when
the moon is in the first degree of Aries, and one manuscript
adds that this must be the full moon.<a id="FNanchor_2523" href="#Footnote_2523" class="fnanchor">[2523]</a> This powder will
heal a wound in the head, or will keep the head from being
wounded, if it is sprinkled on the hair. A face, washed with
it and water, is terrible to foes and secures the faithful allegiance
of friends. If the powder is scattered in an enemy’s
house, he will be unable to remain there. To secure an
attentive hearing in a council, sprinkle a little at your feet.
Place some on the tip of the tongue, and you will be invincible
in scientific disputations. “And this has been tested
many times.” This healing and magic powder also enables
one to see into the future, to learn another’s secrets, to
insure the fidelity of a servant or messenger, to guard against
poison, to win the love of a woman. If a leper eats some
of it, his disease will grow no worse. This last experiment
is perhaps suggested by Galen’s story of the cure of skin disease
by drinking wine in which a viper had died.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Other

<p>At the end of these twelve experiments one manuscript
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_796">[Pg 796]</span>
adds that “John in the same book gives additional statements
which Alcanus composed,” and continues with further
suggestions concerning the medicinal preparation and uses
of snakes and their skins and blood.<a id="FNanchor_2524" href="#Footnote_2524" class="fnanchor">[2524]</a> Similar are <i>Secrets

gave to a doctor of sacred theology of the order of Friars
Minor at Nürnberg,<a id="FNanchor_2525" href="#Footnote_2525" class="fnanchor">[2525]</a> and which direct how to prepare
snakes and recount their medicinal virtues. It will be recalled,
too, that in our preceding chapter we treated of the
<i>Experiments</i> of Nicholas of Poland which made considerable
use of pulverized snakes or toads or scorpions, and which
are sometimes found in the same manuscripts<a id="FNanchor_2526" href="#Footnote_2526" class="fnanchor">[2526]</a> as the <i>Twelve

<div class="sidenote">Chemical

<p>Perhaps this is the same Nicholas to whom chemical experiments
are attributed in two Oxford manuscripts.<a id="FNanchor_2527" href="#Footnote_2527" class="fnanchor">[2527]</a> In
the fuller manuscript these experiments are numbered in the
margin from one to twenty,<a id="FNanchor_2528" href="#Footnote_2528" class="fnanchor">[2528]</a> but sometimes more than one

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_797">[Pg 797]</span>
alchemistic generalizations, such as the opening sentence
which states that there are seven bodies, namely, Saturn,
Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, and Moon, and a
recipe or two for making gold and silver, the treatise consists
of instructions for the preparation of such chemicals as
<i>sal ammoniac</i>, quicksilver, arsenic, sulphur, and common
salt, and of other recipes similar to those in the <i>Book of
Fires</i> of Marcus Grecus.<a id="FNanchor_2530" href="#Footnote_2530" class="fnanchor">[2530]</a>The author frequently cites the
books and experiences of the philosophers but also speaks
of his own experiments. Once, for example, he supports
the assertions of the philosophers by adding, “And I, Nicholas,
say that I have tested these two operations experimentally”:<a id="FNanchor_2531" href="#Footnote_2531" class="fnanchor">[2531]</a>
in another place he says of a powder recommended
“by a very wise philosopher” that he has not yet
experienced it himself as the operation is long and difficult.<a id="FNanchor_2532" href="#Footnote_2532" class="fnanchor">[2532]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Books of
waters.</div>

<p>In addition to the <i>Book of Fires</i> of Marcus Grecus and
the experiments with air in the <i>Secret of Philosophers</i>, we
must not forget the treatises in medieval manuscripts devoted
to marvelous waters, medical and chemical. We have already
seen such works attributed to Aristotle<a id="FNanchor_2533" href="#Footnote_2533" class="fnanchor">[2533]</a> and to Peter
of Spain.<a id="FNanchor_2534" href="#Footnote_2534" class="fnanchor">[2534]</a> At that time, of course, various liquid compounds
and acids were known as “waters”; alcohol, for instance,
was called <i>aqua ardens</i>; and in one manuscript some
of the “waters” are really dry or solid.<a id="FNanchor_2535" href="#Footnote_2535" class="fnanchor">[2535]</a> As in the case of
the treatises ascribed to Aristotle and Petrus Hispanus,
twelve seems to be the favorite number in these medieval
collections of waters, but the twelve are not always the same,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_798">[Pg 798]</span><a id="FNanchor_2536" href="#Footnote_2536" class="fnanchor">[2536]</a>
and sometimes, while the title says twelve, the text will include
more than that number.<a id="FNanchor_2537" href="#Footnote_2537" class="fnanchor">[2537]</a> Such a collection of twelve
waters is sometimes ascribed to Rasis,<a id="FNanchor_2538" href="#Footnote_2538" class="fnanchor">[2538]</a> and once to Vergil,<a id="FNanchor_2539" href="#Footnote_2539" class="fnanchor">[2539]</a>
but often occurs anonymously.<a id="FNanchor_2540" href="#Footnote_2540" class="fnanchor">[2540]</a> Other treatises on waters
in general and the fountain of youth in especial are ascribed
to famous names, Albert Magnus,<a id="FNanchor_2541" href="#Footnote_2541" class="fnanchor">[2541]</a> Arnald of Villanova,<a id="FNanchor_2542" href="#Footnote_2542" class="fnanchor">[2542]</a>
and Thaddeus of Florence<a id="FNanchor_2543" href="#Footnote_2543" class="fnanchor">[2543]</a> and of the University of
Bologna, a thirteenth century writer upon anatomy and
medicine who lived from 1223 to 1303. We also encounter
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_799">[Pg 799]</span>
<i>Nine Waters of the Philosophers</i>,<a id="FNanchor_2544" href="#Footnote_2544" class="fnanchor">[2544]</a> <i>Physical Waters</i>,<a id="FNanchor_2545" href="#Footnote_2545" class="fnanchor">[2545]</a> and
a <i>Book of Saint Giles concerning the virtues of certain waters
which he made while dwelling in the desert</i>.<a id="FNanchor_2546" href="#Footnote_2546" class="fnanchor">[2546]</a> The saint
would scarcely seem to have chosen the best place for the
investigation of his subject. Such are a few specimens of
medieval works on waters; many more might be collected.<a id="FNanchor_2547" href="#Footnote_2547" class="fnanchor">[2547]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Colors.</div>

<p>Experiments with colors are also of rather frequent occurrence
in medieval manuscripts, and seem to a large extent
to be anonymous. I have not sufficiently examined them
to be able to say what additions may be made in the manuscripts
of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries to the
recipes already given in the <i>Compositiones ad tingenda</i>,
<i>Mappe clavicula</i>, and works of Heraclius and Theophilus
of which we have already spoken. Like the <i>Book of Twelve
Waters</i>, but not so widespread, is a treatise on twelve colors
and their virtues,<a id="FNanchor_2548" href="#Footnote_2548" class="fnanchor">[2548]</a> while a Virgilius appears again as the
author of <i>Pictorial Waters for Painting on Linen and
Cloth</i>.<a id="FNanchor_2549" href="#Footnote_2549" class="fnanchor">[2549]</a> The works on colors of Peter of St. Audemar, of
John Alcerius, and of John le Bègue have been printed by
Mrs. Merrifield,<a id="FNanchor_2550" href="#Footnote_2550" class="fnanchor">[2550]</a> but many brief anonymous collections of
recipes concerning colors still remain in manuscript.<a id="FNanchor_2551" href="#Footnote_2551" class="fnanchor">[2551]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_800">[Pg 800]</span></p><div class="sidenote">Necromantic
experiments.</div>

<p>Other examples of necromantic experiments are found
in the manuscripts than those of the <i>Liber sacratus</i>, <i>Picatrix</i>,
and the <i>Liber Vaccae</i>, or those which are attributed to
Michael Scot and Peter of Abano. An anonymous collection
of “conjurations and invocations of spirits to discover thefts
and other things of the sort” contains “among many other
experiments” some concerning three angels in a crystal, a
sibyl in a candle, four kings in a crystal, “a bearded old
man,” and the <i>ars episcopalis</i>.<a id="FNanchor_2552" href="#Footnote_2552" class="fnanchor">[2552]</a> A manuscript at Munich
contains “A probable experiment to provoke spirits from all
four quarters of the universe, whatever their condition,
order, and station, by means of the mass.” “A good experiment
in astrology of Master John of Belton” turns out
to be necromantic, consisting largely in writing and repeating
such words as the Tetragrammaton.<a id="FNanchor_2553" href="#Footnote_2553" class="fnanchor">[2553]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Experimentum
in dubiis.</i></div>

<p>An “Experiment in cases of doubt” from an early thirteenth
century manuscript at Erfurt<a id="FNanchor_2554" href="#Footnote_2554" class="fnanchor">[2554]</a> may perhaps be described
more fully. It should be begun during the March
equinox early in the night with psalms and prayers. Starting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_801">[Pg 801]</span>
forth to a spot where potter’s clay may be found, one
repeats the Paternoster and Credo as one leaves his house
or church. On the road he repeats seven psalms, and if he
meets any passers-by, returns no answer to them. Having
reached the potter’s earth, he plants his heel upon it and
turning successively to the East, South, and North, repeats
the magic word “Syos” to each of those cardinal points.
Turning to the East again, he utters a short prayer beginning,
“Force eternal, innumerable power, true presence of
things, I suppliantly beg your clemency.” Then with a
trowel with a white handle he cuts the earth about his heel,
and digs up enough of it for his purpose, repeating the
while a “Te Deum” and “Gloria in excelsis.” Having secured
the clay by this ceremony, when he wishes to settle
any doubtful question, he writes the words “Yes” and “No”
on two bits of parchment, encloses these in pastilles of the
clay, places a dish of holy water between the two pastilles,
saying, “In the name of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost” and
another pious phrase. Then he puts the pastilles in the
water, adjuring them by the names of Elias and Moses to
show him the truth of the matter in question, and opens for
his answer the first pastille which floats towards him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“A natural
experiment.”</div>

<p>What we should regard as specimens of downright
sorcery and magic are sometimes presented in the manuscripts
not merely as “experiments,” but as instances of
purely scientific procedure. Under the title, “A natural experiment,”
which, however, is likewise called “ineffable,” a
writer in a Paris manuscript<a id="FNanchor_2555" href="#Footnote_2555" class="fnanchor">[2555]</a> describes three <i>Practicae</i>
which may be used against enemies or serpents. Of these
practical experiments the most interesting is the first, which
the writer learned of when he was at Paris from Thomas
de Pisan. This Thomas is also spoken of as of Bologna and
as the physician of the French king. Evidently he is the
father of the poetess, Christine de Pisan, Thomas of
Bologna, who made astrological predictions and composed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_802">[Pg 802]</span>
philters for the learned king, Charles V of France, and the
duke of Burgundy, and who also wrote a letter on the philosopher’s
stone.<a id="FNanchor_2556" href="#Footnote_2556" class="fnanchor">[2556]</a> The object of Thomas’ “experiment”
was the expulsion of the English companies of mercenaries
from the French kingdom. He procured earth from the
center and the four quarters of France and under a selected
constellation made five images of lead or tin in the form of
nude men. On the forehead of each he wrote the name of
the king of England or one of the captains of the companies
and on the jaw and breast astrological characters and names.
These images were hollow and were filled with the aforesaid
earth and at the proper astrological moment were buried
in the five aforesaid regions with an incantation to the effect
that this was the perpetual burial and total destruction and
annihilation of the said captain and king, and the permanent
expulsion of him and every official or adherent of his “so
long as this work shall endure by God’s will, Amen.” The
images were buried face down with their hands behind their
backs, “and within a few months all the said companies had
fled from the realm.” The writer states that all three of his
<i>Practicae</i> are based on the first <i>Practica</i> of Thebit ben
Corath, and notes that Albert the commentator has said in
his <i>Mirror</i><a id="FNanchor_2557" href="#Footnote_2557" class="fnanchor">[2557]</a> that such images are purely natural like medical
recipes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Variety of

<p>It is hard to tell where to make an end of describing or
even of merely illustrating the many collections and isolated
examples of “experiments,” medical, chemical, culinary,
artistic, magical, and necromantic, both of spurious and of
anonymous authorship, to be found in medieval manuscripts.
There are “experiments, good and best” which include such

this and that,” which opens with instructions how to dissolve
phlegmatic humors.<a id="FNanchor_2562" href="#Footnote_2562" class="fnanchor">[2562]</a> In a single manuscript are “incantations
and other experiments,” “Experiments of Alexander,”
“experiments from Galen’s book of <i>Dinamidia</i>,” “general
experiments,” “Experiments of Rusticus” who is perhaps
Rusticus Elpidus, physician to Theodoric, king of the
Ostrogoths, and “Experiments of Parisius, Abbot of St.
Mark’s.”<a id="FNanchor_2563" href="#Footnote_2563" class="fnanchor">[2563]</a> A certain group of experiments seems to be
associated in some way with the emperor Frederick, presumably
the Second.<a id="FNanchor_2564" href="#Footnote_2564" class="fnanchor">[2564]</a> Another group of perhaps twenty-five
experiments was collected at Paris about 1331 and
“approved by divers doctors of the same dear university.”<a id="FNanchor_2565" href="#Footnote_2565" class="fnanchor">[2565]</a>

<div class="sidenote">An experimental
manuscript.</div>

<p>A manuscript which belonged to an English family in
Northamptonshire in the fifteenth century and received some
additional entries in the sixteenth provides a good example
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_804">[Pg 804]</span>
of the scope and character of the experimental interest of
those times. Omitting some brief family records, we find
its main contents to be a calendar, list of eclipses, table and
chart of the influences of planets and signs on the human
body, treatises on flebotomy, on colors, a problem credited
to Aristotle, verses on the seven liberal arts, medical recipes,
a <i>compotus</i>, arithmetics, a <i>Sphere of Pythagoras</i>, the treatise
of John Paul on experiments with snakeskin, Alfraganus
on signs from thunder, what seem to be extracts from
the <i>Herbarium of Apuleius</i> and perhaps from the treatise
of Sextus Papirius Placitus on animals which so often accompanies
it. This last is accompanied by a memorandum
to the effect that there are many true things here and also
many false ones. Charms and further recipes are followed
by a treatise on the conduct of waters and siphoning and
how to learn the altitude of objects, which is not unlikely to
be an extract from the <i>Secretum philosophorum</i>. A treatise
on the moon in the twelve signs is followed by one “on
philosophy according to Aristotle with cases and experiments
proving its thesis.” It opens with the words, “In
these things nature works in an occult fashion.” Next
comes a charm in English, then more recipes in Latin, the
<i>Physiognomy</i> of Aristotle, a treatise of chiromancy, a
<i>Dream Book of Daniel</i>, a further discussion of colors, the
familiar charm to find a thief by means of a loaf of bread,
and various tricks and fireworks.<a id="FNanchor_2567" href="#Footnote_2567" class="fnanchor">[2567]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Experimental
character
of the
Sloane
manuscripts.</div>

<p>How long this experimental literature, which we have
been describing for the medieval period, retained its popularity,
and how large a place it had even in the esteem of
celebrated scholars and scientists, may be inferred from the
very prominent place which it occupies in the manuscript
collection of Sir Hans Sloane, which with his books and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_805">[Pg 805]</span>
scientific collections formed the nucleus of the present British
Museum. Sir Hans Sloane, who lived for nearly a
century from 1660 to 1753, won such a reputation both as
a medical man and a naturalist that in 1727 he became
physician to the king and succeeded Sir Isaac Newton as
president of the Royal Society. Yet the manuscripts collected
by this distinguished scientist contain about as much
alchemy and astrology as they do medicine, while even in
those of the seventeenth century experiments of every sort
continue to play as great a part as ever before. Indeed the
general tenor of the seventeenth century manuscripts in the
collection seems rather more superstitious than in those of
any previous century. This may be due to the fact that
superstition is being crowded out of the printed page by
that time, and finds a refuge only in private manuscripts,
but I am doubtful if such was the fact. We must remember
that the seventeenth century was marked by the witchcraft
delusion, and even Boyle had not quite lost faith in alchemy
despite his <i>The Sceptical Chemist</i>. Perhaps, however,
the combined influences of the <i>Index Expurgatorius</i>, English
censorship of the press, and the natural tendency or
pretense of alchemy and magic to adopt secret and cryptic
methods, were enough to keep a number of works or
“secrets” in manuscript form. Be that as it may, it certainly
seems as if the recipe notion dominated the catalogue
of the Sloane manuscripts and especially so in those of the
seventeenth century. I have not begun to note all the titles
with the word or idea of experiment in them, but I should
like to run over a considerable number of the subjects of
seventeenth century manuscripts which I have jotted down,
and which I think will serve to illuminate the character of
the science of that time, and its relation to the preceding
medieval literature in the same field.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Magic

<p>We come to the books of magic in the manuscripts of
the seventeenth century in the Sloane collection and find
them full and running over with “experiments.” “An excellent
approved experiment to cause a thief to come again
with the goods.” “An experiment to call out spirits that are
keepers of treasure trove, either by an artificiall inchantment
magically, or otherwise by Divine justice.” “An introduction
teaching the use of the foregoing treates and thereby
other experiments.”<a id="FNanchor_2586" href="#Footnote_2586" class="fnanchor">[2586]</a> Another manuscript has “some experiments
and incantations and imperfect conjurations written
by John Evans,” “some experiments for sport,” “an
experiment with book and key to reveal the thief by the
names of the suspects,” and the equally superstitious experiments
of William Bacon.<a id="FNanchor_2587" href="#Footnote_2587" class="fnanchor">[2587]</a> Elsewhere we meet “A magical
treatise containing a number of experiments and directions
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_808">[Pg 808]</span>
to those that will call any spirit,”<a id="FNanchor_2588" href="#Footnote_2588" class="fnanchor">[2588]</a> “Experiments for finding

Amplon. Quarto 361,
English cursive hand of early 14th
century, fol. 24, I have not seen,
and follow the description of it
by V. Rose in his “Ptolemaeus und
die Schule von Toledo,” <i>Hermes</i>,
VIII, 338-40, which is fuller than
the notice in Schum. Rose knew
of no other MS of the treatise,
but I have examined it in the following:
Digby 67, 15th century,
fol. 32.</p>

<p>Both MSS have the same prologue
by Ferrarius, in which the
number of experiments is stated
as eighty-eight, and both open
with the same experiment. Rose
gives the headings of only fourteen
others, and then begins the
Book of Fires of Marcus Grecus,
“Nunc incipiet liber ignium a
marcho greco descriptus,” which,
as Rose says, follows the same
form of a series of experiments
as the preceding Rasis. Indeed,
in Digby 67 the experiments of
both treatises are numbered continuously
in the margin. The
Rasis seems to end with the experiment
numbered 33, a circumstance
which led Macray to describe
it as containing 33 instead
of 88 experiments. Digby 67,
however, does not at present contain
experiments 1-33 inclusive,
but only 1-5 and 27-33; apparently
a sheet is missing. The
<i>Liber ignium</i>, beginning at experiment
34 and at the same juncture
as in the Amplon. MS, since
the preceding experiments in both
cases were concerned with alcohol
(<i>aqua ardens</i>), turpentine,
and Greek fire, comprises twenty-five
experiments, after which miscellaneous
experiments carry the
total number recorded in the margin
up to one hundred and forty-four.
In the Amplon. MS the
<i>Liber ignium</i> is followed by another
experimental treatise entitled
<i>Secreta philosophorum</i>, of
which more will be said presently.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2480" href="#FNanchor_2480" class="label">[2480]</a> First printed in 1804 by La
Porte du Theil at the wish of
Napoleon who had heard of the
old recipes for Greek fire. Hoefer
gave a faulty edition of it in his
<i>History of Chemistry</i>, 2nd edition,
I, 517-24. I have employed
the text printed by Berthelot
(1893) I, 89-135, from four continental
MSS: BN 7156, 13-14th
century; BN 7158, 15th century;
CLM 267, about 1300 A. D.; CLM
197, about 1438 A. D. This text is
accompanied by a French translation,
introduction, and notes.
Berthelot’s discussion of Marcus
Grecus suffers from his ignorance
of the existence of other collections
of experiments similar to it
in MSS contemporary with it. He
notes only its resemblance to the
<i>De mirabilibus mundi</i> ascribed to
Albertus Magnus and to the books
of secrets printed in the sixteenth
century. Marcus Grecus seems
not the same as Mark, the canon
of Toledo (Marcus Canonicus
Toletanus) in the twelfth century
who translated into Latin the Koran
and works of Hippocrates,
Galen, and Honein ben Ishak:
see Steinschneider (1905), p. 54.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2481" href="#FNanchor_2481" class="label">[2481]</a> Besides the MSS used in his
text Berthelot alludes to some MS
of the <i>Liber ignium</i> in England
which belonged to a Mr. Richard
Mead (probably, Professor D. B.
Macdonald suggests, Dr. Richard
Mead, the eighteenth century
London physician, many of whose
books are now in the Hunterian
Museum, Glasgow), but does not
mention Digby 67 and Amplon.

is reduced to ten experiments.
There may be other MSS of the

been a different person from John
of St. Paul’s, a medical writer
whose works will be found in a
number of MSS in the collections
of Amplonius and Sir Hans
Sloane, and whom Scott in his
<i>Index</i> to the Sloane MSS has
identified both with the translator
of the snakeskin experiments and
with John Platearius.</p>

<p>And still different from any of
these would seem to have been
“Ioannis Paulus de Fundis,” doctor
of arts and lecturer on medicine
and astronomy in the university,
and astrologer of the
commune, of Bologna, whose
<i>Tacuinus astronomico-medicus</i>,
written in his own hand in February,
1435, is preserved in a MS
of the University Library at Bologna.

confused with the earlier work

Faradj ben Salem for Charles of

</div>

<p class="h3sub">MANUSCRIPTS OF THE LIBER VACCAE</p>

<p>The three first MSS in the list are those which I have
used. Steinschneider (1906), p. 43, listed four MSS: Digby
71, Corpus Christi 125 and 132, and Montpellier 277. The
three which I examined were wretchedly written and full
of abbreviations.</p>

<div class="hangingblockquote">

<p>Arundel 342, 14th century, Italian hand, fols. 46r-54v. The
<i>Titulus</i> is “Incipit liber institutionum activorum (<i>sic</i>) Platonis
in quo Humayn filius Zacarie sic loquitur dicens.” The <i>Incipit</i> is
“Galienus cum praeparavit ut abreviaret librum Platonis physici,
qui nominatus est liber anguemis.” The <i>Explicit</i> is “Expletus
est liber aggregationum Anguemis Platonis cum expositione
Humayn filii Ysaach gratia Dei.”</p>

<p>Digby 71, 14-16th century, fols. 36r-56, Liber Vaccae, precepta
et experimenta alchemica et magica, praemisso prologo (ut
videtur) longo. Incipit prologus, “Conferat tibi Deus mores
nobiles.” Incipit liber (fol. 40v) “Galienus cum propter amatum
voluit abbreviares (<i>sic</i>) librum Platonis philosophi qui nominatus
est liber anequems.” Ad calcem (fol. 56) “Completur liber
anequems Platonis id est liber vacce.”</p>

<p>Corpus Christi 125, 13-15th century, fols. 121v-141r (141-60, according
to the system of numbering which I have followed in
the foot-notes of the preceding chapter). This MS repeats the
first prologue, found in Digby 71 but missing in Arundel 342.
It ends, “Completus est liber Anaguenis, id est, liber vaccae.”</p>

<p>Corpus Christi 132, 15th century, fols. 139-66, has the same title
and opening as the preceding.</p>

<p>CLM 22292, 12-13th century, fol. 68, Epistola de medicina, opening,
“Conferat tibi deus mores,” and ending, “Explicit epistola
Ameti” (a name which usually means the astrologer Alfraganus);
fol. 70, Prologus in librum Anguemis, of which the
text does not seem to follow, since at fol. 72 comes a commentary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_810">[Pg 810]</span>
on the Aphorisms of Hippocrates. In this early MS therefore
we seem to have only the two prologues.</p>

<p>Amplon. Quarto 188, written in 1267 A. D., 1319, and later, fols.
103-4, Liber vacce seu liber aggregacionis diversorum philosophorum,
opening, “Primor queritur quare risus magis sequitur
titillacionem,” and closing, “significet fleubotomia predominari
et odor debet et etiam.” From its brevity and opening and
closing words this would seem to be only a fragment of our
treatise. Schum states that it was originally followed in the
MS by another treatise on nigromancy, since torn out, and that
in the sixteenth century the two works were given the common
title, “Liber vacce nigromanticus.” But perhaps it is only a part
of the <i>Liber Vacce</i> that has been torn out.</p>

<p>Florence II-iii-214, 15th century, fol. 57-, “Liber institutionum activarum
Platonis in quo Hunayn filius Ysac sic loquitur;” fols.
59-72, “Inquit Hunayn, Galenus dixit ... / ... completus est
liber agregationis aneguemis maioris et minoris Platonis cum
expositione Unayn filii Ysac et declaratione Galieni.”</p>

<p>The treatise was once found in the library of St. Augustine’s
Abbey, Canterbury, 1275, vacca platonis.</p>

<p>Among MSS which T. Allen had in 1622 but which are no longer
in the Digby collection was, in 16mo, Liber Anequems Platonis,
id est, Liber vaccae.</p>

<p>CU Trinity 1214, good hand of late 12th century, fols. 71-82, is
perhaps an earlier precursor of our treatise, judging from the
following headings given by James: “De aque ductibus, de

... de calce ... de fabrica ville rustice disponenda, de balneis

of the manuscripts,<a id="FNanchor_2594" href="#Footnote_2594" class="fnanchor">[2594]</a> and is called “very wise,” “a philosopher,”
“most skilled in mathematics,” and “very learned in
the arts of necromancy.” The treatise is also said to have
been compiled by Norbar the Arab in the twelfth century.<a id="FNanchor_2595" href="#Footnote_2595" class="fnanchor">[2595]</a>
The Latin manuscripts state that in 1256 it was translated
from Arabic into Spanish by order of Alfonso the Wise;
but when it was translated into Latin is not stated. There
seem to be no Latin manuscripts older than the fifteenth century,
and none of our thirteenth century Latin writers seems
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_814">[Pg 814]</span>
to have been acquainted with the work. Peter of Abano, it
is true, is charged by Symphorien Champier, writing in
1514,<a id="FNanchor_2596" href="#Footnote_2596" class="fnanchor">[2596]</a> with having borrowed from <i>Picatrix</i>, but Champier
does not substantiate his charge and I have found no unmistakable
evidence of it in Peter’s works. Evidently, however,
<i>Picatrix</i> was well-known in Latin by 1514. Rabelais,
who lived from 1495 to 1553, speaks of “le reuerend pere en
Diable Picatris, recteur de la faculté diabolologique” at
Toledo.<a id="FNanchor_2597" href="#Footnote_2597" class="fnanchor">[2597]</a> A Cambridge doctor about 1477 cites “Picatrix
in his third book of magic.”<a id="FNanchor_2598" href="#Footnote_2598" class="fnanchor">[2598]</a> The work seems never to
have been printed and J. Wood Brown expresses the hope
that it may never be translated into any modern language.<a id="FNanchor_2599" href="#Footnote_2599" class="fnanchor">[2599]</a></p>

<p>Law of
Alfonso
the Wise
concerning
magic
and
astrology.</p>

<p>It was fitting that such a work should have been translated
from the Arabic under the patronage of Alfonso X, the
Wise or Learned, who is noted for his astronomical tables,
and whose favorable attitude toward astrology and magic
may be seen from the law on those subjects in his code of
the Seven Parts.<a id="FNanchor_2600" href="#Footnote_2600" class="fnanchor">[2600]</a> Divination of the future by the stars is
sanctioned in the case of persons properly trained in astronomy,
although other varieties of divination are forbidden.
And while those who conjure evil spirits or who make waxen,
metallic, or other images with the aim to harm their fellows
are to be punished by death; those who employ incantations
with good intentions and good results are pronounced deserving
of reward rather than penalty. Thus no objection
is made to magic procedure but only to evil intentions and
results.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Picatrix</i>
a confused
compilation.</div>

<p><i>Picatrix</i> divides into four books and is accompanied in
the manuscripts by tables of contents which, however, are
not as helpful as might be expected, since the work really has
no plan and the division into books and chapters is quite
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_815">[Pg 815]</span>
arbitrary.<a id="FNanchor_2601" href="#Footnote_2601" class="fnanchor">[2601]</a> In short, the work is a confused compilation of
extracts from occult writings and a hodgepodge of innumerable
magical and astrological recipes. The author states
that he “has compiled this book,” that he intends to set forth
“in simple language” what past sages have concealed in
cryptic words, and that he has spent some six years in reading
two hundred and twenty-four books by “ancient sages.”<a id="FNanchor_2602" href="#Footnote_2602" class="fnanchor">[2602]</a>
Whenever modern compilers of the notions of folk-lore and
the magical customs of aborigines shall have exhausted their
resources, a rich mine will still await them in this book of
magic. We can give but a few specimens of its contents
here.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mentions
of magic.</div>

<p>For <i>Picatrix</i> is openly and professedly a book of magic.
At the close of the first of its four books we are told that
its contents are “the roots of the magic art” and that “without
them one cannot become perfect in such arts.”<a id="FNanchor_2603" href="#Footnote_2603" class="fnanchor">[2603]</a>
Throughout all four books such phrases are used as “magic
works,” “magic effects,” “magical sciences,” and “the operator
of magic,” and books of magic are cited by Abrarem
(Abraham?), Geber, and Plato.<a id="FNanchor_2604" href="#Footnote_2604" class="fnanchor">[2604]</a> It is true that the term
necromancy is also employed frequently and a chapter devoted
to its definition,<a id="FNanchor_2605" href="#Footnote_2605" class="fnanchor">[2605]</a> and that astrological images and invocations
of demons are the subjects most discussed. So in
a way the work is primarily a treatise of astrological necromancy.
But it is said on the supposed authority of Aristotle
that the first man to work with such images and to
whom spirits appeared was Caraphrebim, the inventor of
the magic art.<a id="FNanchor_2606" href="#Footnote_2606" class="fnanchor">[2606]</a> It is also affirmed that the science of the
stars is the root of magic, that the forms of the planets or
astronomical images “have power and marvelous effects in
magic operations;” while after announcing his intention of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_816">[Pg 816]</span>
listing “the secrets of ancient sages in the magic art,” the
first thing that our author divulges is that the influence of
Saturn exceeds the influence of the moon.<a id="FNanchor_2607" href="#Footnote_2607" class="fnanchor">[2607]</a> Evidently little
distinction is made between astrology and magic. On the
whole then, although magic is not defined at length in <i>Picatrix</i>,
it seems justifiable to apply it as a general term covering
the contents of the book, and to regard astronomical
images and invocations of demons as two leading features
of the magic art.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Magic and
science.</div>

<p>Picatrix regards magic as a science, as a superior branch
of learning, to excel in which one must first master many
other studies. He believes that the greatest philosophers of
antiquity, such as Plato and Aristotle, have written books
of magic. Hermes is also cited frequently. Our author also
has a high appreciation of science which in his first chapter
he declares to be God’s greatest gift to man. “It always is
making acquisitions and never diminishes; it ever elevates
and never degenerates; it is always clear and never conceals
itself.”<a id="FNanchor_2608" href="#Footnote_2608" class="fnanchor">[2608]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Use of
natural
virtues.</div>

<p>Much use of natural objects is made in the various recipes
of <i>Picatrix</i>. Here is one brief example: Adam the prophet
says that if you take fourteen grains of the fruit of the
laurel tree, dry them well and pulverize them and put the
powder in a very clean dish in vinegar, and beat it with a
twig from a fig tree, you can make anyone you wish possessed
of demons by giving him this powder to drink.<a id="FNanchor_2609" href="#Footnote_2609" class="fnanchor">[2609]</a> One
chapter is especially devoted to “the virtues of certain substances
produced from their own peculiar natures,” and the
author further explains that “in this section we shall state
the marvelous properties of simple things, as well of trees
as of animals and of minerals.”<a id="FNanchor_2610" href="#Footnote_2610" class="fnanchor">[2610]</a> Hermes is quoted as saying
that there are many marvels for necromancy in the human
body,<a id="FNanchor_2611" href="#Footnote_2611" class="fnanchor">[2611]</a> and various parts thereof are often employed by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_817">[Pg 817]</span>
Picatrix. Thus in making a magic mirror a suffumigation
is employed of seven products of the human body, namely,
tears, blood, ear-wax, spittle, <i>sperma</i>, <i>stercus</i>, <i>urina</i>.<a id="FNanchor_2612" href="#Footnote_2612" class="fnanchor">[2612]</a> Indeed,
vile and obscene substances are in great demand for
purposes of magic throughout the book. Picatrix, like the
<i>De mirabilibus mundi</i>, considers heat an important force in
magic and mentions both elemental and natural heat, the
former referring to the use of the element fire in sacrifice,
suffumigation, and the preparation of magic compounds,
the latter designating the heat of digestion when simples or
mixtures must be eaten to take effect.<a id="FNanchor_2613" href="#Footnote_2613" class="fnanchor">[2613]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Magic
compounds.</div>

<p>Although we have found one chapter devoted to the virtues
of simples, in actual magical procedure several things
are generally combined, as in a suffumigation with fourteen
dead bats and twenty-four mice, to give a comparatively simple
example.<a id="FNanchor_2614" href="#Footnote_2614" class="fnanchor">[2614]</a> On the supposed authority of Aristotle in a
book written to Alexander, detailed instructions are given
how to make four “stones” of great virtue and of elaborate
composition by procedure more or less alchemistic.<a id="FNanchor_2615" href="#Footnote_2615" class="fnanchor">[2615]</a> Indeed,
there are listed all sorts of “confections,” compounds, and
messes, either to burn or to sacrifice or to eat or to drink
or to smell of or to anoint oneself with, in order to bring
various wonders to pass. The ingredients employed include
different oils and drugs, butter, honey, wine, sugar, incense,
aloes, pepper, mandragora, twigs, branches, adamant, lead,
sulphur, gold, the brains of a hare, the blood of a wolf, the
urine of an ass, the filth of a leopard, and various portions
of such further animals as apes, cats, bears, and pigs. Besides
the actual ingredients all sorts of receptacles and material
paraphernalia are called into requisition: vessels, jars,
vases, braziers, crosses, candles, crowns, and so on.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Things
required
of the
magician.</div>

<p>Much is said of the magician himself as well as of the
materials which he employs. He should have faith in his
procedure, put himself into an expectant and receptive mood,
be diligent and solicitous.<a id="FNanchor_2616" href="#Footnote_2616" class="fnanchor">[2616]</a> Often chastity is requisite, sometimes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_818">[Pg 818]</span>
fasting or dieting, sometimes the wearing of certain
garments.<a id="FNanchor_2617" href="#Footnote_2617" class="fnanchor">[2617]</a> He must have studied a long list of other sciences
before he can attempt necromancy, but then he must
drop all other studies and devote himself to it exclusively.
A little knowledge of necromancy is a dangerous thing, and
the ignorant meddler therein is liable to be violently slain by
indignant demons.<a id="FNanchor_2618" href="#Footnote_2618" class="fnanchor">[2618]</a> Much depends also upon the magician’s
personality and natural fitness. No one can succeed in the
science of images unless his own nature is inclined thereto
by the stars. Some men are more subtle and spiritual, less
gross and corporeal than others, and hence more successful
in magic.<a id="FNanchor_2619" href="#Footnote_2619" class="fnanchor">[2619]</a> The ancients, when they wished to employ a boy
in magic, used to test his fitness by fire as well as make sure
that he was physically sound.<a id="FNanchor_2620" href="#Footnote_2620" class="fnanchor">[2620]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Magic
procedure.</div>

<p>It has already been implied that great stress is laid upon
procedure in <i>Picatrix</i>. Extensive use is made of images of
the person or thing concerned. Thus an image of a fish is
employed to catch fish, and to bewitch a girl a waxen image
of her is made and dressed in clothes like hers. In both
cases, however, there is additional ceremony to be observed.
In the image of the fish the head should first be fashioned;
furthermore the image of the fish is to be poised on a slender
rod of silver and this is to be stood erect in a vessel filled
with water. This vessel is then to be hermetically sealed
with wax and dropped to the bottom of the stream in which
it is proposed to fish.<a id="FNanchor_2621" href="#Footnote_2621" class="fnanchor">[2621]</a> In the bewitching of the girl, which
is recounted as an actual occurrence, the object was to make
her come to a certain man. Hence another image was made
of him out of a pulverized stone mixed with gum, and the
two images of man and girl were placed facing each other
in a vase where seven twigs of specified trees had been arranged
crosswise. The vase was then buried under the
hearth where there was a moderate fire and a piece of ice.
When the ice had melted, the vase was unearthed and the
girl was immediately seen approaching the house. In the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_819">[Pg 819]</span>
reverse process to free her from the spell a candle was lit on
the hearth, the two images were taken out and rudely torn
apart and an incantation uttered.<a id="FNanchor_2622" href="#Footnote_2622" class="fnanchor">[2622]</a> To make a spring that
is going dry flow more freely a small and comely virgin
should walk up and down beating a drum for three hours,
and then another small and good-looking girl should join in
with a tambourine for six hours more. To ward off hail
storms a company of people should go out in the fields, half
of them tossing handfuls of silk or cotton (<i>bombix</i>) toward
the sky and the other half clapping their hands and shouting
as rustics do to frighten away birds.<a id="FNanchor_2623" href="#Footnote_2623" class="fnanchor">[2623]</a> Tying seven knots
and saying an incantation over each is another specimen of
the ceremonial in <i>Picatrix</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Invocation
of spirits.</div>

<p>Ritual also plays an important part in the invocation of
spirits. If one wishes to invoke the spirit called “Complete
Nature” he must enter a spick and span room while the moon
is in the first degree of Aries. Various receptacles filled with
different foods and combustibles must be arranged in a certain
way on a table. Then he must stand facing the east and
invoke the spirit by its four names seven times and repeat a
prescribed form of prayer for increase of knowledge and of
moral strength.<a id="FNanchor_2624" href="#Footnote_2624" class="fnanchor">[2624]</a> To draw down the virtue and power of
the moon one crowns oneself in the favorable astrological
hour and goes to a green spot beside a stream. There he beheads
with a bone&mdash;under no circumstances employing iron&mdash;a
cock with a divided crest. He stands between two
braziers filled with live coals on which he casts grains of
incense gradually until smoke arises; then, looking toward
the moon, he should say, “O moon, luminous and honored
and beautiful, thou who shatterest darkness by thy light,
rising in the east and filling the whole horizon with thy
light and beauty, I come to thee humbly asking a boon.”
Having stated his wish, he withdraws ten paces, facing the
moon the while and repeating the above formula. Then
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_820">[Pg 820]</span>
more incense is burned and a sacrifice performed and characters
inscribed on a leaf with the ashes of the sacrifice
and a bit of saffron. This leaf is then burned, and as its
smoke rises the form of a well-dressed man will appear, who
will answer the petition.<a id="FNanchor_2625" href="#Footnote_2625" class="fnanchor">[2625]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Necromancy
and
astrology.</div>

<p>Throughout <i>Picatrix</i> planets and spirits are closely associated.
Many instructions are given how to pray to each
of the planets and to work magic by their aid, just as if they
were demons. It is hard to say whether the spirits are more
thought of as forces in nature or the stars as gods. A necromancer
who does not know astronomy is helpless, and
each planet has a list of personal names associated not only
with itself but with its every part and position.<a id="FNanchor_2626" href="#Footnote_2626" class="fnanchor">[2626]</a> Lists are
also given of the boons which one may ask from each planet,
and of the stones, metals, animals, trees, colors, tinctures,
odors, places, suffumigations, and sacrifices appropriate to
each planet and sign of the zodiac, in order that one may use
the proper materials, eat the right food, and wear the right
clothes when petitioning any one of them.<a id="FNanchor_2627" href="#Footnote_2627" class="fnanchor">[2627]</a> Let us remember,
too, that the natural qualifications of the magician depend
upon his horoscope.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Astronomical
images.</div>

<p>Finally <i>Picatrix</i> devotes much space to astronomical
images,<a id="FNanchor_2628" href="#Footnote_2628" class="fnanchor">[2628]</a> which, engraved preferably upon gems in accordance
with the aspect of the sky at some instant when the constellations
are especially favorable, are supposed to receive
the celestial influences at their maximum and store them up
for future use. That they receive “the force of the planets”
and produce marvelous works, such as the invocation of
demons, is in our author’s opinion “proved by nature and
by experiment.” He lists images for forty-eight figures
made from the fixed stars, for the twenty-eight mansions of
the moon, for the signs of the zodiac and for the planets.
One of the images for Saturn will suffice as an example: “A
man erect on a dragon, holding a sickle in his right hand
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_821">[Pg 821]</span>
and a spear in his left hand, and clad in black clothing and
a panther skin.” This image “has power and marvelous effects
in magic works.”<a id="FNanchor_2629" href="#Footnote_2629" class="fnanchor">[2629]</a> Characters composed of lines and
geometrical figures are also derived from the constellations
and are supposed to possess marvelous efficacy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Aims and
results
of magic.</div>

<p>Some of the results attributed to images and characters
are to drive away mice, free captives, throw an army into a
town, either render buildings safe and stable or impede the
erection of them, the acquisition of wealth, making two persons
fall in love, making men loyal to their lord, making the
king angry with someone, curing a scorpion’s sting, walking
on water, assuming any animal form, causing rain in dry
weather and preventing it in rainy weather, making the stars
fall or sun and moon appear divided into many parts. The
possessor of such images can further ascend into the air
and take on the form of a falling star, or speak with the
dead, or destroy an enemy or city, or traverse great distances
in the twinkling of an eye. The aims of incantations, invocations,
and recipes are similar, as has already been indicated
in several cases. Ten “confections” are listed that stop
evil tongues; eight, that generate discord and enmity; six,
that cure impotency, if taken in food; seven, that induce a
sleep like unto death; ten, that induce a sleep from which one
never wakes.<a id="FNanchor_2630" href="#Footnote_2630" class="fnanchor">[2630]</a> Others prevent dogs from barking at you,
produce green tarantulas or red snakes, remove bothersome
frogs from pools, cause water to burn and appear red, enable
you to see small objects a long way off, make the winds
and tempests obey you, deprive others of memory or sense
or speech or sight or hearing, and so on through a long list.
The aims are infinitely varied, and are sometimes good,
sometimes evil.</p>

<p class="h3sub">MANUSCRIPTS OF PICATRIX</p>

<p>I have chiefly used Magliabech. XX, 20 and XX, 21, two
MSS now preserved at the National Library at Florence
and originally written at Rome in 1536, as an identical colophon
in either MS states. Otherwise, however, their contents
are often not identical although roughly corresponding.
I have also examined Sloane 1305 and found it in general
similar to the other two.</p>

1256, referring to the Spanish rather than Latin translation).
The foregoing occurs two leaves before the book proper begins
and is in a larger print-like hand than the text itself, which
opens: “Alibi incipit liber excellentissimi viri picatrix picatrici

Johannis Argentin, where there is a citation of “Picatricem

<div class="sidenote">Guido
Bonatti
and Dante.</div>

<p>With these words Vergil calls the attention of Dante and
ourselves to the presence of that astrologer in the fourth
division of the eighth circle of the Inferno among those
spirits who in life had tried to pry too far into the future
and were condemned henceforth to look backwards with
turned heads. This is all that Dante says of Bonatti, although
Benvenuto of Imola, the fourteenth century commentator
upon the <i>Divine Comedy</i>, adds a number of tales
concerning him, some of which may be true but most of
which are stock stories like that of the speaking brazen head,
told of many other medieval men of learning. But we may
perhaps associate Bonatti and Dante in our minds a little
further. Forlì, Bonatti’s native city, lies almost in a
direct line between Florence, where Dante lived his early
life, and Ravenna, where he ended his exile. Indeed, Filippo
Villani<a id="FNanchor_2631" href="#Footnote_2631" class="fnanchor">[2631]</a> and Fossi<a id="FNanchor_2632" href="#Footnote_2632" class="fnanchor">[2632]</a> would persuade us that Guido Bonatti,
too, was born a Florentine but, like Dante, became an exile
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_826">[Pg 826]</span>
from the town of his birth and called himself a native of
Forlì because he came to hate the place of his birth which
he had left on account of the strife of political factions.
Finally, Bonatti and Dante had a common interest in astronomy.<a id="FNanchor_2633" href="#Footnote_2633" class="fnanchor">[2633]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The <i>Liber
astronomicus</i>
of Guido
Bonatti.</div>

<p>The most important astrological work produced in Latin
in the thirteenth century seems to have been the <i>Liber astronomicus</i>
of this Guido Bonatti,<a id="FNanchor_2634" href="#Footnote_2634" class="fnanchor">[2634]</a> which is a voluminous
work divided into some ten or a dozen treatises.<a id="FNanchor_2635" href="#Footnote_2635" class="fnanchor">[2635]</a> In the
preface, after some of the usual devout opening phrases of
medieval authors, Guido states that he writes the book particularly
for the use of his nephew, that the work will
be “long and prolix” and that on this account he will not
include “disputations nor many proofs.” He proposes to
compile a work from past authors which can be understood
by those who do not yet know much of other sciences “and
especially for your use, Bonatus, my nephew.” Indeed, the
annalist of Forlì states that Bonatti expounded the doctrine
of astrology so clearly in this book that “it seemed as if
he wished to teach women astrology.”<a id="FNanchor_2636" href="#Footnote_2636" class="fnanchor">[2636]</a> Guido employs
such classical authorities as Ptolemy, Hermes, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_827">[Pg 827]</span>
Dorotheus, but still more such Arabian astrologers as Alcabitius,
Albumasar, Messahala, and Thebit ben Corat.<a id="FNanchor_2637" href="#Footnote_2637" class="fnanchor">[2637]</a> He
also states that he has made additions of his own,<a id="FNanchor_2638" href="#Footnote_2638" class="fnanchor">[2638]</a> and many
passages demonstrate that he has made detailed practical
application to the present problems of medieval life of the
principles of his art established in the past. The popularity
and influence of Guido’s work is attested by the numerous
manuscripts, including an interesting <i>de luxe</i> manuscript
of it and other astrological treatises made for the use of
Henry VII of England, whose picture is given in the midst
of Bonatti’s text.<a id="FNanchor_2639" href="#Footnote_2639" class="fnanchor">[2639]</a> There are also several printed editions of
the Latin text and translations of the work into several modern
languages. There is an Italian translation of it in a
manuscript in the Laurentian library at Florence; a German
translation was printed at Basel in 1572; and an English
translation by William Lilly appeared in print at London in
1676.<a id="FNanchor_2640" href="#Footnote_2640" class="fnanchor">[2640]</a> Thus Dante’s consignment of Bonatti’s soul to hell
does not seem to have kept people from reading his <i>Liber
astronomicus</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Career
of Bonatti.</div>

<p>The battle of Valbona, fought in 1277, seems to be the
latest event mentioned by Bonatti. He also speaks of having
himself seen many evidences of the cruelty of Ezzelino,
and of that tyrant’s death, which occurred in 1259. He was
alive as early as 1223, when he mentions having seen a certain
man.<a id="FNanchor_2641" href="#Footnote_2641" class="fnanchor">[2641]</a> Guido seems to have been a professor at the
university of Bologna. He must have died before 1300,
when Dante’s visit to the Inferno is supposed to have occurred.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_828">[Pg 828]</span>
Bonatti’s death, however, would seem to have been
comparatively recent, since the <i>Annals of Forlì</i><a id="FNanchor_2642" href="#Footnote_2642" class="fnanchor">[2642]</a> represent
him as playing a prominent part in the defense of that town
in 1282 by the famous captain, Guido of Montefeltro,
against a large force sent by Pope Martin IV. Though
Bonatti himself was loyal, it was in a wheat field belonging
to him that conspirators gathered in a vain attempt to betray
the town, while the enemy later encamped outside the city
in another field belonging to him and called, “Of the oak
tree.”</p>

<p>Then Guido of Montefeltro, we are told, “captain of the
people of Forlì, together with lord Guido Bonatti, a citizen,
philosopher, and most eminent astrologer, having called the
people together in the public square,” instructed them as to
the strategem of a mock withdrawal from town and subsequent
return by which he intended later to take the superior
forces of the enemy unawares after they had entered the
town in triumph and were overcome by feasting and drinking.
The strategem turned out a complete success, and the
<i>Annals</i> give much of the credit to Bonatti, by whose counsel,
art, and forecasting the future it is said to have been planned.
He was wounded in the battle, while carrying medicines, but
this too he had foreseen and foretold. Later, when the pope
sent more mercenary troops into Romagna, Forlì deemed
it prudent to submit, and Guido of Montefeltro transferred
his military activities elsewhere and finally, we are told, made
his peace with the pope and spent his declining years in the
Franciscan Order. Some say that Bonatti followed his
patron into the convent, but it seems very improbable in view
of the hard things which he had said of the friars. On the
other hand, judging from the number of Franciscans who
have written works on astrology and astrological medicine,
he might not have found such retirement entirely uncongenial,
and need scarcely have surrendered his astrological
views in consequence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_829">[Pg 829]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Arrangement
of the <i>Liber
astronomicus</i>.</div>

<p>But we turn to the contents of the <i>Liber astronomicus</i>.
Bonatti’s first treatise is a general introduction in which he
defines his subject, discusses its utility, and meets the objections
of its opponents. The second treatise<a id="FNanchor_2643" href="#Footnote_2643" class="fnanchor">[2643]</a> deals with
the signs of the zodiac and their characteristics and subdivisions.
The third treatise, in two parts,<a id="FNanchor_2644" href="#Footnote_2644" class="fnanchor">[2644]</a> deals with the
planets, their influences on things on earth and their effects
on one another. The fourth treatise deals chiefly with
conjunctions. The remaining treatises comprise 146 considerations
affecting astrological judgments, another brief
introduction of three chapters to the subject of judgments,<a id="FNanchor_2645" href="#Footnote_2645" class="fnanchor">[2645]</a>
discussions of the four chief departments of astrological
prediction, interrogations, elections, revolutions, and nativities,
and a final treatise upon prognostication of changes in
the weather.<a id="FNanchor_2646" href="#Footnote_2646" class="fnanchor">[2646]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Astronomy
and
astrology.</div>

<p>As the title, <i>Liber astronomicus</i>, shows, Bonatti generally
uses the word “astronomy” where we should say “astrology”
and <i>vice versa</i>. He states, for instance, that nativities,
elections, interrogations, and revolutions are four varieties of
“astronomy,” which he distinguishes from other forms of
divination.<a id="FNanchor_2647" href="#Footnote_2647" class="fnanchor">[2647]</a> He also says, however, that the words “astronomy”
and “astrology” may be used interchangeably. He
regards both as of great value in the study of first philosophy.
Through these sciences we come to know impassive
and unalterable creatures who cannot be changed into any
other essence, and through these creatures we can attain to
as much knowledge of the Creator as the human mind can
reach. Nobler than the profession of the physician who
deals with the four inferior and corruptible elements is that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_830">[Pg 830]</span>
of the astrologer whose concern is with superior and incorruptible
bodies composed of the fifth essence.<a id="FNanchor_2648" href="#Footnote_2648" class="fnanchor">[2648]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Truth of
astrology.</div>

<p>Bonatti asserts confidently and vehemently all the
main suppositions of the astrological art. He affirms that
its principles ought not to be proved but assumed, since they
all reduce to one point which he does not believe that anyone
doubts, namely, that the motion of the heavens surrounding
the elements alters fire and air and that these alter
the other elements, earth and water.<a id="FNanchor_2649" href="#Footnote_2649" class="fnanchor">[2649]</a> “All wise men agree
in this, that inferiors are ruled by superiors.”<a id="FNanchor_2650" href="#Footnote_2650" class="fnanchor">[2650]</a> The astrologer
understands every motion of each heavenly body; therefore
he knows what impressions they make and what their
significations are. “Therefore all things which are being
done now or have existed in the past or will be done in the
future, can be known by the astrologer.”<a id="FNanchor_2651" href="#Footnote_2651" class="fnanchor">[2651]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Theological
opposition.</div>

<p>It will hardly be profitable for us to follow Bonatti’s rehearsal
of familiar arguments for and against the influence
of the stars and the practicability of the art of astrology.
But we may well note those passages in which he suggests
the existence of a contemporary ecclesiastical and theological
opposition to his art. Bonatti at least does not appear to
have any fear of the clerical detractors of astrology, of whom
he speaks quite disdainfully, hurling back at them the charges
of heresy which they had perhaps directed at him. “I would
have you know,” he affirms in the introduction to his treatise
on Elections, “that fortune rules in everything, although
some fools among those wearing the tunic (that is, the
friars) may say that fortune does not exist, but only what
God wills. But the wiser of them dissent from this in secret,
although they may seem to assent in public, rather from fear
that their Orders be thought less of than from a conviction
of its truth. For if fortune did not exist, who would be so
stupid as not to know how to acquire at will an abundance
of the necessaries of life? Yet we daily see quite the contrary.
For do you not see wise men of integrity and intelligence
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_831">[Pg 831]</span>
who do not have enough to eat?” Bonatti consequently
contends that those who deny the existence of fortune
“impute madness to their Creator, falsely representing
Him as unjust, and falling into a hateful heresy.” He then
continues, “And although at times many fools and idiots
in tunics have arisen against me, declaring elections to be
of absolutely no value, nevertheless elections and the other
parts of astronomy have stood in their strength, nor has their
truth diminished any on this account.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bonatti’s
defiant
rejoinder.</div>

<p>As for those self-styled theologians who object that the
stars are so countless in number that their influence cannot
be measured and estimated, Bonatti assures them that astrologers
know vastly more about the stars than the theologians
do about God, “Of Whom they none the less preach daily.”<a id="FNanchor_2652" href="#Footnote_2652" class="fnanchor">[2652]</a>
He further asserts that the holy fathers of old employed astrology,
that Abraham taught it to the Egyptians, and that
Christ implied the truth of the doctrine of elections. For
when the disciples endeavored to dissuade Him from returning
to Judea, where recently He had been nearly stoned to
death, He replied, “Are there not twelve hours in the day?”
meaning that He might now select a more fortunate time than
before. “And this makes it plain that He used elections and
did not blaspheme astronomy as some jealous detractors do
today.” Bonatti then mentions “some silly fools, of whom
that hypocrite, John of Vicenza, of the Order of Preaching
Friars was one, who said that astrology was neither an art
nor a science.” Guido scarcely thinks it worth while to notice
such men.<a id="FNanchor_2653" href="#Footnote_2653" class="fnanchor">[2653]</a> This John of Vicenza mentioned by Bonatti
was the well-known friar of that name to whom manifold
miracles were attributed and who in the Alleluia year of
1233 had been made duke of Vicenza, but so abused his
power that he was soon imprisoned and discredited. Bonatti
complains that no one had ever seen a single one of the
eighteen men whom John was said to have raised from the
dead, and affirms that he himself long sought in vain for
anyone who had either been cured by John or had himself
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_832">[Pg 832]</span>
witnessed one of John’s miracles.<a id="FNanchor_2654" href="#Footnote_2654" class="fnanchor">[2654]</a> On the other hand, the
friar Salimbene tells us in his <i>Chronicle</i> that Guido Bonatti,
who reviled the preaching of the friars, “was so confounded
by” a “Brother Ugo before the university and people of
Forlì that he not only feared to speak, but even to show himself
during all the time that the Brother was in those parts.”<a id="FNanchor_2655" href="#Footnote_2655" class="fnanchor">[2655]</a>
But perhaps Brother Hugo was one of those persons whom
Guido thought it scarcely worth while to notice.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Astrological
predictions
for
Christians
and the
clergy.</div>

<p>Against these allusions to an opposition to astrology
among the friars, or at least, among the Dominicans, should
be set other passages which indicate that Bonatti’s book is
intended for the use of Christians and even of the clergy,
whose preaching and practice anent astrology seem divergent.
One of the illustrations which he employs against those who
argue that it is better not to know the future, since to learn
of ills beforehand will only make one so much the sadder,
is that even if one learns that his disease is fatal, he is forewarned
to make his will and receive the last sacrament in
season.<a id="FNanchor_2656" href="#Footnote_2656" class="fnanchor">[2656]</a> Among the interrogations which Bonatti lists are
whether a bishopric or abbotship or cardinalate, or other
clerical dignity, rank, or order, even up to the papacy, will
be attained by the inquirer.<a id="FNanchor_2657" href="#Footnote_2657" class="fnanchor">[2657]</a> In this connection Guido grants
that it may not seem honorable to seek ecclesiastical offices,
but that the fact is that many clergy do it and that it is necessary
for the astrologer to be prepared to answer them, if
they consult him as to their prospects. In the treatise on
elections instructions are given how to choose the favorable
hour for building churches as well as castles and cities. The
treatise on revolutions tells what will be the state during any
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_833">[Pg 833]</span>
year of the bishops and other secular clergy or the religious
and regular clergy, as well as of other social classes such as
kings or princes, rich men or magnates, soldiers, women,
merchants, populace, and serfs. Indeed, that even a Preaching
Friar in the middle ages was not necessarily opposed to
astrology, is seen from an Oxford manuscript of the fifteenth
century, where not far from <i>Rules one should know concerning
various matters relating to the sick, according to Guido
Bonatti and others</i>, is a treatise in astrological medicine by
Nicholas of Aquila of the Order of Preachers.<a id="FNanchor_2658" href="#Footnote_2658" class="fnanchor">[2658]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Instances
of Bonatti’s
detailed
treatment.</div>

<p>We may not follow Bonatti through his long technical
discussions of houses and exaltations of the planets, of
<i>triplicitates</i> and <i>termini</i>, of why the naming of the signs of
the zodiac begins at Aries and not at any other sign, or of
what part of the body each planet signifies in each sign, and
a hundred other similar questions. It must suffice to give
a few suggestions of the thoroughness of his detailed treatment.
The treatise on nativities promises to reveal everything
which will “naturally”&mdash;a saving word for those who
insist on freedom of the will&mdash;befall the child from birth to
death, “and also what will be said of him after death.” Pursuant
of his promise, Guido considers such topics as length
of life, physical and mental qualities, offices and property to
be held by the person concerned, the fate of his brothers,
parents, and children, serfs, and domestic animals, his sickness
or health, mental afflictions, marriage, feuds, death, religion,
learning, and journeys. The treatise on interrogations
answers questions on all sorts of matters from winning
crowns or gaining one’s freedom to learning how many
courses and what kind of food there will be at a dinner to
which one has been invited and which one is in a quandary
whether to accept or not. The treatise on elections selects
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_834">[Pg 834]</span>
favorable hours for any and every act of life from weaning
and circumcising infants to trimming one’s nails, hair, and
beard. The treatise on revolutions descends from the fate
of monarchs and nations during the year in question to such
matters as the prospects for a good crop of melons or cucumbers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The planet
Jupiter.</div>

<p>Some further idea of Bonatti’s method and content may
be derived from the following translation of his account of
the properties, significations, and effects of the planet Jupiter.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Alchabitius has said that Jupiter is fortunate, masculine,
diurnal; and is by nature significant of property, since
property is the second accident that happens to the child
after birth ... and Jupiter is second in the order of the
planets. Jupiter is likewise the second planet to exert its
influence on the child before birth, giving it spirit and
life. And its nature produces heat and moisture, and is
temperate, aerial, and sanguine. Of man’s age Jupiter
signifies the period called <i>iuventus</i> from youth to the prime
of life, namely, from fourteen or twenty-one to forty or
forty-five years. It governs those offices pertaining to
law and just and honest judgments. And it attends when
it sees any persons engaged in altercation or litigation,
and makes peace between them and bestows harmony upon
them, and ever is engaged in good pursuits. And it signifies
abundant property. And such business occupations
as are performed without deceit.</p>

<p>“It signifies spirit, life, joy, religion, truth, patience, and
every precept that is good, lovely, and precious, and everything
that is honorable. It indicates abundant charm. Of
infirmities it signifies those due to excess of blood....
It is the planet of wisdom, of intellect, of sound practice.
Moreover, if Jupiter be well disposed and in the east and
at a favorable angle, the child will be of good quality,
benign, just; he will honor the aged, and will be a good
counselor, a helper of the needy, and of good repute. He
will cherish his friends; he will be of good intellect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_835">[Pg 835]</span></p>

<p>“But if Jupiter shall be unfavorable, Ptolemy is witness
that the child will be ignorant of well doing, versed in
diabolical practices, that he will intrigue under a hypocritical
exterior, will linger in places of prayer, will gladly
live in crypts and caverns and caves, and there will predict
the future. He will love no one, though he may have
a few friends; he will abhor his children, will shun human
conversation, will seek no honors from anyone, will be
untrustworthy, and no one can depend on him. In fine, he
will be bad, weak, stupid, weary and heavy-laden, of evil
election.”</p>
</div>

<p>Having thus considered the properties of Jupiter <i>per se</i>, Bonatti
next proceeds to record its tendencies when in conjunction
with Saturn and the other planets.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An astrological
image.</div>

<p>One of the stories told of Bonatti may be noted in conclusion,
since it concerns an astrological image. Pitying a
poor apothecary with whom he used to play chess, Guido
gave him a wax image of a ship, telling him to keep it hid
in a box in a secret place and he would grow rich, but that
if he removed it, he would grow poor again. True enough,
the man became wealthy, but then began to fear lest the
image be the work of witchcraft. So, having made his fortune,
he decided to save his soul and confessed concerning
the image to a priest who bade him destroy it. But then,
as Bonatti had predicted, he rapidly lost his entire fortune.
He then begged Guido to make him another image, but
Bonatti cursed him and told him that the image had been
no magic one but had derived its virtue from constellations
which would not recur for another fifty years.<a id="FNanchor_2659" href="#Footnote_2659" class="fnanchor">[2659]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
geomancy
of Bartholomew
of Parma.</div>

<p>If the <i>Liber astronomicus</i> of Guido Bonatti was the leading
Latin work on astrology in the thirteenth century, probably
the most elaborate treatise in the associated art of
geomancy was that by another Italian, Bartholomew of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_836">[Pg 836]</span>
Parma, who appears to have written a long <i>Summa</i><a id="FNanchor_2660" href="#Footnote_2660" class="fnanchor">[2660]</a> on the
subject in 1288 in Bologna at the request of Theodosius de
Flisco, bishop-elect of Reggio in northern Italy;<a id="FNanchor_2661" href="#Footnote_2661" class="fnanchor">[2661]</a> and then
in October, 1294, a briefer treatment for two German
friends and disciples named John and Paul,<a id="FNanchor_2662" href="#Footnote_2662" class="fnanchor">[2662]</a> and again in
November, 1295, another abbreviated treatment for the beginner.<a id="FNanchor_2663" href="#Footnote_2663" class="fnanchor">[2663]</a>
Titles in manuscripts at Vienna indicate that Bartholomew
also wrote astrological treatises,<a id="FNanchor_2664" href="#Footnote_2664" class="fnanchor">[2664]</a> but perhaps they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_837">[Pg 837]</span>
would prove to be merely extracts from his longer work on
geomancy, although Houzeau and Lancaster give the date of
a <i>Liber de occultis</i> by him as 1280.<a id="FNanchor_2665" href="#Footnote_2665" class="fnanchor">[2665]</a> None of Bartholomew’s
works seems to have been printed. The interest of the canon
of Laon and bishop elect of Reggio in the art of geomancy
is another of numerous indications that we have had that
such occult and superstitious arts were at least not consistently
condemned by the church and clergy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How to
proceed in
geomancy.</div>

<p>Bartholomew of Parma tells us that the art of geomancy
originated from God and was taught to the sons of Noah by
an angel who took on human form before the time of the
flood. Whoever intends to practice that art should be “a
friend of God” and a good man of praiseworthy life. No
one should make use of it without real necessity of knowing
the future and geomancers should beware of persons who
try to catch them in error by asking questions about sure
things. On the other hand, in certain cases one may ask
questions for another person, and even without his knowledge,
and questions may be put at any time and place, for
the art of geomancy is simple and easy of operation. The
only instrument needed is something to make a series of
points or marks with. These dots should be set down in
four rows like the four fingers of a hand, but at random
without noting how many dots one puts in each row or how
long the row is.<a id="FNanchor_2666" href="#Footnote_2666" class="fnanchor">[2666]</a> These four rows indicate the elements,
points of the compass, and so on. Next one cancels the
points in each line, cancelling two at a time until only one
or two points remain in each line. When this is done we
have one of the following sixteen possible geomantic figures,
which I have indicated numerically rather than graphically:
2121, 2212, 1211, 1222, 2111, 2222, 2112, 2211, 1212,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_838">[Pg 838]</span>
2122, 1121, 2221, 1112, 1111, 1221, 1122. Of these the
first eight are favorable, the last eight are unfavorable. They
bear such names as gain, white, childhood, joy, head (<i>acquisitio</i>,
<i>albus</i>, <i>pueritia</i>, <i>laetitia</i>, <i>caput</i>). The first inventors
of the art are supposed to have worked out these figures
“with great ingenuity and subtlety” from careful observations
of the stars and of the virtues of the sky. Hence these
figures have the property of signifying much concerning the
future. Each is associated with some particular sign of the
zodiac and with one of the planets. Also with a day, month,
color, odor, taste, stone, tree, metal, and human type.<a id="FNanchor_2667" href="#Footnote_2667" class="fnanchor">[2667]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Questions
answered
by
geomancy.</div>

<p>Among the questions which geomancy undertakes to answer
are how long one will live, whether one will better one’s
present position, whether one should enter the clergy or remain
a layman, whether a journey will be dangerous,
whether a rumor is true or false, whether to buy or not,
whether the year will be a fertile one, and concerning gain
and loss, hidden treasure, the condition of a city or castle,
and which side is stronger in a war. Whether a child will
be born or not, of what sex it will be, and whether it is legitimate
or a bastard. Which of two magistrates is superior
in wisdom, whether a scholar can by study become an honor
to the convent or not, whether the soul of some dead person
is in paradise or before the doors of paradise or in purgatory
or in hell. In answering such questions the figure found by
chance from the points is compared with and related to
figures appropriate to the person inquiring and the thing
sought, and a decision is rendered according as enmity or
friendship is found to exist between them. In determining
this the figures are reduced to terms of the twelve signs of
the zodiac, and the astrological aspects are thus investigated.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Recent
research
into his
life.</div>

<p>Arnald of Villanova has been rather unusually fortunate
among medieval men of learning in the accurate research
which within the last fifty years scholars have made into the
sources for the facts of his career. Before that time all sorts
of assertions and dates were current concerning his life, although
even then those who took the pains to turn back to
Astruc,<a id="FNanchor_2668" href="#Footnote_2668" class="fnanchor">[2668]</a> could find in his work a tolerably correct account
of Arnald’s biography. But now we have a much fuller
treatment of his life and works by Hauréau in the <i>Histoire
Littéraire de la France</i>,<a id="FNanchor_2669" href="#Footnote_2669" class="fnanchor">[2669]</a> while the researches of Menéndez
Pelayo<a id="FNanchor_2670" href="#Footnote_2670" class="fnanchor">[2670]</a> in the Vatican library and the crown archives of
Aragon have brought to light new documents of importance.
Subsequently Chabás has discovered an old and authentic
copy of Arnald’s last will and testament in the cathedral
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_842">[Pg 842]</span>
archives of Valencia.<a id="FNanchor_2671" href="#Footnote_2671" class="fnanchor">[2671]</a> Further materials bearing upon his
career appeared in Finke’s <i>Acta Aragonensia</i>,<a id="FNanchor_2672" href="#Footnote_2672" class="fnanchor">[2672]</a> and have
been written up by Diepgen in a monograph on Arnald’s
political and theological activity after 1299.<a id="FNanchor_2673" href="#Footnote_2673" class="fnanchor">[2673]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">His
twofold
importance.</div>

<p>Arnald’s personality and career have long attracted attention,
not only because of his prominence as a practicing
physician and writer on medicine and alchemy, and because
of his close relations with several kings and popes. He also
is noted for his connection with ecclesiastical history, his relations
with the Spiritual Franciscans and the theologians
of Paris, and for his criticisms of existing conditions in the
church of his time,&mdash;criticisms which he combined with
Joachimite ideas of a speedy end of the world and coming
of Antichrist. These points long ago caused his inclusion in
Matthias Illyricus Flacius’s <i>Catalogue of Witnesses to the
Truth who before our time attacked the primacy of the
Roman pontiffs and the various superstitions, errors, and impious
frauds of Popery</i>,<a id="FNanchor_2674" href="#Footnote_2674" class="fnanchor">[2674]</a> and more recently in Menéndez
Pelayo’s <i>Historia de los heterodoxos españoles</i>. And it is
true that Arnald composed a violent diatribe against the
regular clergy of his day and also a <i>Sword of Truth against
the Thomists</i>.<a id="FNanchor_2675" href="#Footnote_2675" class="fnanchor">[2675]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Narrative
of his life.</div>

<p>Arnald was a Catalan, although Pope Clement V speaks
of him as “a clerk of Valencia.” Arnald writes of his youth
as a time of hardship and of himself as “a country practitioner”
without literary culture. Yet he came to shine at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_843">[Pg 843]</span>
courts and to defy synods of learned doctors of theology.
He also mentions his early education in a Dominican convent
and his study of medicine at Naples under John Calamida.
During his entire life he seems to have been continually
moving about, and his works speak of observations and
operations in many towns of Spain, Italy, and France. Some
of his treatises were written in Valencia, others in Barcelona,
others in Naples, or in Gascony, Piedmont, Bologna, Rome,
and even Africa. He was often called abroad to render medical
services to popes and other potentates and was frequently
employed in foreign diplomacy by the kings of Aragon
and Sicily. By 1285 he had won a sufficient reputation as
a physician to be called from Barcelona to attend Peter III
of Aragon in his last illness. Peter gave him a castle in
Tarragona. After that Arnald seems to have taught at
Montpellier which was then under the jurisdiction of Aragon.
Three later bulls of Clement V in 1309 making regulations
for the medical faculty at Montpellier mention Arnald of Villanova
as one of the persons by whom the pope has been advised
in the matter, and speak of him as having “once long
ruled” in that university.<a id="FNanchor_2676" href="#Footnote_2676" class="fnanchor">[2676]</a> Astruc tells us that in the eighteenth
century the house where he had lived was still shown
in Montpellier, ornamented with sculptured figures which
were interpreted as magic symbols.<a id="FNanchor_2677" href="#Footnote_2677" class="fnanchor">[2677]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">In theological
difficulties.</div>

<p>In 1292 Arnald composed a treatise on the significance
of the holy name, <i>Tetragrammaton</i>, both in Hebrew and
Latin, and on the declaration of the mystery of the Trinity.
This and later essays of his in the field of religion were not
well received by most theologians, who would have preferred
that he confine his efforts to medicine. In 1299 Arnald was
sent to Paris with a message from James II of Aragon to
Philip the Fair. Here he was arrested by the inquisition,
but was bailed out the next day, Nogaret being among those
who stood security. Presently he was brought to trial before
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_844">[Pg 844]</span>
the bishop and the theological faculty of Paris for a
work predicting the coming of Antichrist about the middle
of the fourteenth century upon the basis of passages in
Daniel and the Erythrean sibyl, and his book was ordered
to be burned.<a id="FNanchor_2678" href="#Footnote_2678" class="fnanchor">[2678]</a> Arnald protested to the king of France and
later to a crowd of distinguished people at the bishop’s palace
and appealed to Pope Boniface VIII. Finally he was allowed
to leave France and in November, 1301, is found at
Genoa.</p>

<p>Arnald submitted to Boniface VIII a slightly modified
version of his work on Antichrist, accompanied by a tone of
pious self-abnegation and considerable shrewd flattery of the
pope as “Christ on earth” and “God of gods.” The theologians
of Paris, however, had sent a portion of the original
text to the pope with the result that Boniface kept Arnald in
prison for a time and forced him to abjure his work in
secret consistory, but finally said that Arnald had erred only
in not submitting the work to him in the first place. After
Arnald had treated Boniface successfully for the stone, that
pontiff’s estimation of him greatly improved, and he received
favorably a new work which predicted the history of the
Mediterranean world for the next century until the coming
of Antichrist, bewailed the worldliness of the clergy, but upheld
the papal power, to which, of course, Arnald looked to
further the ecclesiastical reforms which he had at heart.
Boniface also presented Arnald with a castle at Anagni, but
the sun proved too hot there for Arnald’s head. Early in
1302 he left the papal curia, in April he received permission
from King James II to dispose of his property in Valencia.
His writings on Antichrist and against certain of the clergy
continued, and in February, 1304, he was at Marseilles complaining
before the bishop of some Dominicans who had attacked
his treatises. He then addressed himself to the new
pope, Benedict XI, at Perugia, but was not well received,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_845">[Pg 845]</span>
and complained that the pope had judged and punished him
before hearing him. But Benedict’s brief pontificate was
soon over and Clement V showed himself more gracious.<a id="FNanchor_2679" href="#Footnote_2679" class="fnanchor">[2679]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Events
of 1305.</div>

<p>Meanwhile in April, 1305, Arnald returned to Barcelona
where he found James II sick abed and very glad to see him
and to entrust himself to his medical care rather than that
of Ermengard Blasius (or Blasii)<a id="FNanchor_2680" href="#Footnote_2680" class="fnanchor">[2680]</a> who had hitherto attended
James. About this time Arnald seems to have interpreted
a dream for James, but that monarch later repudiated
Arnald’s account of the affair and they were estranged for a
time.<a id="FNanchor_2681" href="#Footnote_2681" class="fnanchor">[2681]</a> Arnald’s will, drawn up on July 20, 1305, by a public
notary of Barcelona, informs us concerning his library, other
property, generosity to the poor, and reveals the fact that he
had a wife and children.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
close of
his life.</div>

<p>Arnald, however, still had several years of life before
him. A declaration has been preserved which he made in
1306 concerning the observance of certain statutes at the
University of Montpellier.<a id="FNanchor_2682" href="#Footnote_2682" class="fnanchor">[2682]</a> James II employed him in 1306-1307,
and he corresponded with Clement V and Philip IV.
In 1308-1309 he interpreted a dream for Frederick of Sicily
and with him concocted a scheme for a crusade and reform
of the church, in pursuance whereof he went to Rome, Barcelona,
and Avignon, and carried letters back and forth between
James and Frederick.<a id="FNanchor_2683" href="#Footnote_2683" class="fnanchor">[2683]</a> Arnald had been with Clement
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_846">[Pg 846]</span>
V at Bordeaux and seems to have been with him again
at Avignon in 1309, but he does not appear to have been
the pope’s official physician,<a id="FNanchor_2684" href="#Footnote_2684" class="fnanchor">[2684]</a> although very probably he rendered
him some medical service. About this time he also
seems to have written several treatises in medicine and alchemy,
including his <i>Preservation of Youth</i>, for King Robert
at Naples. Raymond Lull speaks of meeting him there
and acknowledges his debt to his friend Arnald for one of
his “Experiments.” A letter of December 6, 1311, from
Escarrer at Naples to King James shows that Arnald died
in the closing months of that year.<a id="FNanchor_2685" href="#Footnote_2685" class="fnanchor">[2685]</a> In 1312 we find Clement
V advertising by public letter for a medical treatise by
Arnald intended for his perusal but which the death of the
author had prevented from reaching its destination.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Arnald
and the
Inquisition.</div>

<p>Already during Arnald’s lifetime in 1305 the inquisitor
of Valencia forbade the possession or reading of his books,
a decree against which King James protested. Five years
after Arnald’s death the inquisitor and provost of the
church at Tarragona declared some statements in Arnald’s
writings heretical, and Diepgen thinks that we have lost a
number of his religious writings in Catalan in consequence;<a id="FNanchor_2686" href="#Footnote_2686" class="fnanchor">[2686]</a>
but this sentence appears to have no more lessened his medical
influence than his trial at Paris had prevented his having
intimate relations with the popes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His
works.</div>

<p>One indication of Arnald’s long continued influence in
the learned world is that some seven so-called complete editions
of his works were printed in the course of the sixteenth
century.<a id="FNanchor_2687" href="#Footnote_2687" class="fnanchor">[2687]</a> Besides this, some of his writings were published
separately or appeared in miscellaneous collections, and some
were translated into the vernacular languages. Some, however,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_847">[Pg 847]</span>
still remain in manuscript form. The majority of his
writings are medical, such as the <i>Mirror of Medical Introductions</i>,
<i>Breviary of Practice</i>, <i>Rule of Health</i>, <i>General
Rules for the Cure of Disease</i>, <i>Commentary on the Regimen
Salernitanum</i>, <i>Collection of Antidotes</i>, and special treatises
on the stone, gout, and epilepsy. But besides the works of
alchemy ascribed to him there are other treatises on themes
of especial interest to us, the <i>Disapprobation of Sorcerers</i>
(<i>Libellus de improbatione maleficiorum</i>), <i>Remedies against
Sorcery</i>, <i>Judgments of Infirmities by the Motion of the
Planets</i>, and the treatise on <i>Seals</i> or astrological images.
Although Arnald interpreted dreams for kings, the treatise
on interpretation of dreams which is printed with his works
is in the manuscripts either anonymous or ascribed to William
of Aragon. Some of these other works too are perhaps
not by him, but similar themes are occasionally touched
upon in his more purely medical works. In the printed editions
of his works is found a Latin translation of the treatise
of Costa ben Luca <i>On physical ligatures</i>, which we have already
discussed, and it is not unlikely that some of the aforesaid
works are translations from the Arabic and not original
compositions by Arnald. Some of his medical writings seem
little more than repetitions of Galen, whose works he cites a
great deal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His attitude
to
natural
science.</div>

<p>In one of his medical works Arnald states that the proverbs
of Solomon show that what learned men have revealed
in the world of nature can be adapted by convenient metaphor
to moral instruction. But from this one should not
jump to the conclusion that he thought that the chief use of
natural science was to point a moral. On the contrary in
almost the next sentence we find him affirming that “all true
knowledge arises from the senses” and that the education of
youth should begin with this sense knowledge, “graciously
and efficiently demonstrated.” Thus Arnald would assign to
natural science a leading place in education. As the mind
went over this material, he thinks that it would reach many
abstract conclusions, and could gradually attain “to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_848">[Pg 848]</span>
knowledge of insensible and occult and arduous and subtle
things, as is illustrated by the whole course of theology
and by the whole course of medicine.”<a id="FNanchor_2688" href="#Footnote_2688" class="fnanchor">[2688]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Magic
excluded
from
medicine.</div>

<p>There are passages in Arnald’s works where, like Pliny,
Galen, and other writers since them, he professes to exclude
everything savoring of magic and superstition from his
medicine. For instance, in his chapter on <i>Those things
whose use is permitted in the cure of epilepsy</i>, a disease into
whose treatment we have seen that magic is especially
liable to enter, he would “repel the ignominious” enchanters,
conjurers, and invokers of spirits, diviners and augurs,
from the field of medicine as a godless crew who are servants
of the devil. He cites the church fathers to show
that all pagan divination is by demon aid. In the same
chapter he disapproves of any use of “characters and superstitions”
in medicine, and even forbids the use of the sign
of the cross or Lord’s Prayer in collecting medicinal
simples.<a id="FNanchor_2689" href="#Footnote_2689" class="fnanchor">[2689]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Disapprobation
of
Sorcerers.</i></div>

<p>In his <i>Libellus de improbatione maleficiorum</i><a id="FNanchor_2690" href="#Footnote_2690" class="fnanchor">[2690]</a> Arnald
questions the power of sorcerers or necromancers to invoke
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_849">[Pg 849]</span>
demons and compel them to give responses or to work
wonders. By adopting a very similar argumentation to
that of the early fathers he arrives at the familiar theological
conclusion that men are purposely misled in these
arts of sorcery and necromancy by the demons who have
invented the fiction of an art and a procedure to cover their
own iniquitous ends. Arnald is not concerned to emphasize
this conclusion especially, however; his object is rather
simply to show that demons cannot naturally be compelled
by man to obey him. He argues that the human mind, which
is joined to a body, is of inferior grade to separate or incorporeal
substances and so cannot command them. He
also holds that demons who are spiritual beings cannot be
coerced by human use of natural objects such as gems or
even by human use of the influence of the stars. He denies
that demons are distributed in any particular quarters of
the heavens, or that they are subject to man at any particular
hours of the day. He denies that spirits can be coerced
by the light of the celestial bodies, asking, if this is so,
why they are invoked at night and in darkness rather than
at midday. He admits that it is the opinion of many that
a spirit can be coerced by the special virtue of Saturn or
of Jupiter or some other star; but he questions whether
man can master this special virtue of a planet, “since no
terrestrial substance naturally governs a star, although some
philosophers have said that the human soul sometimes commands
the nature of the elements.” He also raises the
familiar objection that the invokers of spirits are usually
inferior to other men in virtue and intelligence, whereas
those who lead pure and rational lives should by rights be
the ones to control the influence of the stars, if any men
can. Arnald further denies that artificial figures and characters
or words uttered by man can overpower demons,
since these artificial products derive such virtues as they
have from things of inferior nature or the stars or the
human artificer, and he has already insisted that none of
these can coerce spirits. He justly observes that to contend
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_850">[Pg 850]</span>
that necromancers can control the demons through
superior demons is “stupidly said” and begs the question.
He therefore concludes that God alone can control the
evil spirits and that He would delegate His power, if at
all, only to saintly men and not to such wicked sinners as
the invokers of demons are. The <i>Histoire Littéraire de la
France</i>, in its brief account of this treatise, says, “It goes
without saying that Arnald does not think all sorceries
purely imaginary; however, it should be stated that he
tries to demonstrate that demons are less at the beck and
call of sorcerers than is commonly thought, and that many
so-called instances of sorcery are merely pathological
cases.” This last has reference to the close of the treatise
where Arnald makes the commonplace medieval observation
that persons suffering from melancholy are to be
humored in their delusions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The devices
of
sorcerers.</div>

<p>That Arnald did not regard all sorceries as purely imaginary
is further indicated by the long list of remedies against
them collected in his <i>Remedia contra maleficia</i>. All but
one or two of the suggestions made by Petrus Hispanus
in the chapter on counteracting witchcraft and dispelling
demons in the <i>Thesaurus pauperum</i> are found again in
Arnald’s treatise. He also adds others and prefaces his list
of cures by a description of the devices employed by sorcerers
to impede conjugal relations. The sorcerer usually
secretes in the mattress or pillow of the nuptial bed such
objects as the two halves of an acorn, granulated beans,
written characters, the filth of a bat, or the testicles of a live
cock. Arnald recommends that such articles be searched for
and removed, or preferably taken to a priest; or that the
couple sleep in another bed or house.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Counter-magic
against
them.</div>

<p>In the case of the divided acorn he more explicitly
recognizes the validity of the sorcerer’s sympathetic magic
by prescribing an equally magical counter-ceremony. The
husband and wife are each to take one-half of the nut and
place the two halves together, and, after an interval of six
days, eat them. Apparently Arnald believes that humans
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_851">[Pg 851]</span>
can be bewitched by use of natural substances and written
characters, although in the other treatise he denied that
demons could be so invoked. But now he goes farther and
lists natural antidotes and preventives against demons as
well as sorcery. Thus keeping the heart of a vulture or
certain herbs in the house is said to cause demons to flee,
although we have heard him deny that demons can be attracted
by natural substances. Less surprising is the use
of the sign of the cross, of holy water, masses, and the
writing of the Tetragrammaton and other names. Interesting
rites for the protection of newly married couples
against witchcraft of unknown origin are suffumigations
of the nuptial chamber with the gall of a certain fish, or
the leaves and fruit of a bramble bush, or the pulverized
tooth of a dead man.<a id="FNanchor_2691" href="#Footnote_2691" class="fnanchor">[2691]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Arnald’s
works and
the Inquisition
again.</div>

<p>The <i>Histoire Littéraire de la France</i>, remarking that
this treatise by Arnald was forbidden later by the Spanish
Inquisition, adds, “No one will hold that decision against
them” (<i>On ne leur reprochera pas cette décision</i>). But one
wonders if the Inquisition also condemned the <i>Thesaurus
pauperum</i> of Pope John XXI, which we have seen contained
many of the same remedies against witchcraft. Only
another proof that censors never know what is in the books
that they condemn! But perhaps the medieval or papal
inquisition would not have made such a slip. Certainly the
Spanish Inquisition had grown very captious, if, as the
<i>Histoire Littéraire</i> says, it also forbade Arnald’s treatise on
astrological medicine and some alchemistic works ascribed
to him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Incantations.</div>

<p>Arnald’s attitude in the matter of incantations is as
inconsistent as his position regarding the effect of natural
substances on spirits. In one passage of his <i>Breviarium</i><a id="FNanchor_2692" href="#Footnote_2692" class="fnanchor">[2692]</a> he
condemns the incantations employed in cases of childbirth
by the old-wives of Salerno. Taking three grains
of pepper, the enchantress would say over each a Lord’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_852">[Pg 852]</span>
prayer, substituting for the words, “Deliver us from evil,”
the request, “Deliver this woman from the pangs of childbirth.”
Then she would administer the grains one after
another in wine or water so that they should not touch
the patient’s teeth, and finally she would repeat thrice in
the patient’s ear this incantation, accompanied each time
by a <i>Paternoster</i>,</p>

    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Benedictus qui venit in nomine domini, osanna in excelsis.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Arnald declares that such diabolical practices should be
shunned by all the faithful. Yet in the same treatise<a id="FNanchor_2693" href="#Footnote_2693" class="fnanchor">[2693]</a> he
tells of an almost identical procedure by which a priest cured
him of over a hundred warts within ten days. The priest
touched the warts, made the sign of the cross, turned to a
parietary and kneeling repeated the Lord’s prayer, substituting
for the words, “Deliver us from evil,” the request,
“Deliver Master Arnald from the wens and warts on his
hands.” After which, instead of the three peppercorns he
plucked the tips of three of the stalks of the parietary, at
the same time repeating three <i>Paternosters</i>, and placed those
three tips in the ground in a damp and secluded spot.
“And,” concludes Arnald, “when they began to wither, my
warts began to disappear.” It is true that the couplet of
jargon, which perhaps Arnald regarded as alone diabolical,
is omitted and that a priest rather than a witch performed
the rite, but the Lord’s prayer is still used as an incantation
and the ceremony with the stalks is a clear case of magic
transfer of disease and of sympathetic magic. In a third
passage of the same treatise<a id="FNanchor_2694" href="#Footnote_2694" class="fnanchor">[2694]</a> Arnald suggests the following
“good prayer” against quinsy, “Lord Jesus Christ,
truly our God, by the power of thy name Jesus and by the
prayer of thy servant Blasius,<a id="FNanchor_2695" href="#Footnote_2695" class="fnanchor">[2695]</a> deign to free A. thy servant.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_853">[Pg 853]</span>
The popularity of <i>The Breviary of Practice from
head to soles of feet</i>, in which these passages occur is indicated
by the fact that it had been printed three times during
the later fifteenth century before any complete edition of
Arnald’s works had been published.<a id="FNanchor_2696" href="#Footnote_2696" class="fnanchor">[2696]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Cures of
old-wives.</div>

<p>Arnald does not always speak ill of the cures of the
old-wives. At Rome he saw a poor woman cure quinsy sore-throat
with a plaster of her own,<a id="FNanchor_2697" href="#Footnote_2697" class="fnanchor">[2697]</a> and at Montpellier a good
wife cured by some secret method a man who was threatened
with death by a continuous hemorrhage.<a id="FNanchor_2698" href="#Footnote_2698" class="fnanchor">[2698]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Ligatures
and suspensions.</div>

<p>It was not inappropriate that Arnald should have translated
the treatise of Costa ben Luca on <i>Incantations, Adjurations,
and Suspension from the Neck</i>, or that at least that
treatise should appear among his works, in view of the
specimens of prayers and formulae which we have just given
and of the more numerous instances of ligatures and suspensions
in his works which we shall next illustrate. In
his <i>De parte operativa</i> he says that there are plants, stones,
and parts of animals which, if suspended about the neck
or bound about the body or sewn into the clothing, produce
impotency, a belief which his <i>Remedia contra maleficia</i> have
already illustrated. In his treatise on wines he states that
coral suspended from the neck so that it touches the abdomen
prevents disturbances of the stomach. In his work
on epilepsy<a id="FNanchor_2699" href="#Footnote_2699" class="fnanchor">[2699]</a> among other suspensions he mentions some
which he has tried with boys, the wood of certain trees
bound with silver. Kings are taught to suspend an emerald
about their children’s necks as soon as they are born as a
protection against epilepsy, or the gem may be worn in a
ring as an amulet against that disease. “Socrates recites
this marvelous experience,” of the two stones found in
swallows’ gizzards and how one may be worn in skin as
an amulet. In his <i>Treatment for Gout</i> Arnald tells how
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_854">[Pg 854]</span>
“some experimenters” bind a frog’s legs on the patient’s
feet, right foot on right, and left on left; while “another
philosopher and experimenter” binds on the stone magnet,
and still others use the talon of an eagle or the foot of a
tortoise.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Marvelous
virtues in
nature.</div>

<p>As these ligatures and suspensions suggest, Arnald was
a believer in marvelous virtues in stones, plants, animals,
and human beings, and he discusses the general subject of
occult virtue at some length. He accepts the notion that
the magnet cannot attract iron in the presence of adamant.<a id="FNanchor_2700" href="#Footnote_2700" class="fnanchor">[2700]</a>
A way to discover whether an epileptic has been cured is
to make him inhale smoke from burning horn of goat or
pulverized agate; if not perfectly cured, he will straightway
fall in a fit.<a id="FNanchor_2701" href="#Footnote_2701" class="fnanchor">[2701]</a> Fumigation of a villa or manor with a
cow’s left horn keeps away locusts.<a id="FNanchor_2702" href="#Footnote_2702" class="fnanchor">[2702]</a> Arnald enlarges upon
the great virtue of wine in which a heated gold plate has
been extinguished four or five times. Some persons merely
hold a gold-piece in the mouth while drinking wine, but
Arnald deems it wiser to reduce the gold to potable form,
although he admits that there may be some efficacy in the
other method, since merely holding silver in the mouth
quenches thirst and holding coral in the mouth comforts
the stomach.<a id="FNanchor_2703" href="#Footnote_2703" class="fnanchor">[2703]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Occult
virtue
defined.</div>

<p>In the eighteenth chapter of his <i>Mirror of Introductions
to Medicine</i> Arnald defines occult virtue or <i>proprietas</i>,
as he also calls it. Briefly it is a property which
is not immediately perceptible to the senses as are heat and
cold, color, odor, and taste, and also one for which reason
cannot account and whose existence cannot be learned by
reasoned experiment but only by chance discovery. This
is because such occult virtue depends on two things: the
mixture of the elements in the object possessing it and its
“specific form.” But the ratio of components in compounds
“varies infinitely” and cannot be learned by reason, and the
same is true of their “specific forms.” Nor can they be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_855">[Pg 855]</span>
discovered by rational experiment which requires some objective
to aim at. Therefore the only way to discover the
occult virtue of an object is to happen upon its manifestation
by chance. Again in his <i>Repetitio super Canon ‘Vita
Brevis</i>’<a id="FNanchor_2704" href="#Footnote_2704" class="fnanchor">[2704]</a> Arnald declares that “properties” cannot be learned
by reason but only by experience or revelation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Due to
the stars.</div>

<p>Such occult virtue, or at least the “specific form” upon
which it partly depends, is ascribed by Arnald as usual to
the influence of the stars. It is owing, for example, to “the
specific influence of the heavens” that gold is “something
arcane, most perfect in its equable temperament, composed
of a marvelous proportion of the virtues of the elements,
and which has not its like among compounds.”<a id="FNanchor_2705" href="#Footnote_2705" class="fnanchor">[2705]</a> The gold
made by alchemists may resemble it in color and substance
but not in this occult virtue. Arnald, indeed, holds what
Aquinas and others denied, that different individuals of
the same species may be endowed by the stars with diverse
properties.<a id="FNanchor_2706" href="#Footnote_2706" class="fnanchor">[2706]</a> This is in his opinion the explanation why
one sapphire will harm and another cleanse the human eye.
“It leaps into the eye and is received in its bosom without
injury and comes out loaded with foreign matter.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Astrological
medicine.</div>

<p>From the occult virtue of terrestrial objects we are thus
led as usual to the superior influence of the stars, which
occupies a prominent, or better, fundamental place in
Arnald’s works. He affirms that “since it is evident that
God, the supreme artificer and begetter, has committed
the government of nature to the motions of the stars, their
influence upon the human body is no slight one.”<a id="FNanchor_2707" href="#Footnote_2707" class="fnanchor">[2707]</a> Or he
cites Galen as saying that philosophers assert that all things
on earth are formed and fulfilled by the course and working
of the heavenly bodies.<a id="FNanchor_2708" href="#Footnote_2708" class="fnanchor">[2708]</a> The hour of collecting medicines
is often very important<a id="FNanchor_2709" href="#Footnote_2709" class="fnanchor">[2709]</a> and the physician should also know
how the air about us is altered by the stars.<a id="FNanchor_2710" href="#Footnote_2710" class="fnanchor">[2710]</a> Astrological
medicine is also found in Arnald’s treatise on preserving
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_856">[Pg 856]</span>
youth and retarding age,<a id="FNanchor_2711" href="#Footnote_2711" class="fnanchor">[2711]</a> and in his <i>Judgments of Infirmities
by the Motion of the Planets</i>, where he also associates
the members of the human body with the signs of the zodiac.
This he does for the seven planets in his treatise on
epilepsy.<a id="FNanchor_2712" href="#Footnote_2712" class="fnanchor">[2712]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Bleeding
and the
moon.</div>

<p>Arnald alludes a number of times to the practice of
bleeding according to the phases of the moon. In his <i>Regulation
of Health</i> he discusses how the age of the moon and
its location, conjunctions, and aspects must be taken into
account.<a id="FNanchor_2713" href="#Footnote_2713" class="fnanchor">[2713]</a> In his <i>General Rules for the Cure of Disease</i><a id="FNanchor_2714" href="#Footnote_2714" class="fnanchor">[2714]</a>
he says that the influence of the moon should be regarded
by physicians in their pharmacy as well as their blood-letting,
as anyone who operates long and intelligently will find
by experience. Astrological authors prove it, but medical
authors generally remain silent on this point. Arnald finds
support, however, in Galen’s <i>Critical Days</i> and other works,
and in the more recent works of Gilbert of England, who
cautions to observe the moon in bleeding and advises against
blood-letting in dog-days or on Egyptian days. Arnald
would also include cauterization, other surgical operations,
and the administration of drugs, and there is much observance
of dog-days in his <i>Treatise against the stone</i>. On
the other hand, Arnald rejects as false and worthless the
statement in the <i>Regimen Salernitanum</i> that the months of
April, May, and September are lunar and that in them are
the days on which bleeding is prohibited.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bernard
Gordon’s
personal
experience.</div>

<p>Bernard Gordon, a medical contemporary of Arnald,
notes in his <i>Phlebotomy</i>, written in 1307, that wise astronomers
agree that bleeding should not be practiced when
the moon is in Gemini, because at that time the vein will not
give blood or it will open again or the patient will die. He
goes on to narrate, however, that once having made all
preparations to bleed himself, it suddenly occurred to him
that the moon was then in Gemini. He persisted with the
operation, however, which would seem to indicate that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_857">[Pg 857]</span>
he did not really believe that it would prove disastrous; and
he records that as a matter of fact that particular bleeding
did him more good than any other one he ever underwent.
Yet as the <i>Histoire Littéraire</i> notes,<a id="FNanchor_2715" href="#Footnote_2715" class="fnanchor">[2715]</a> he reproduced the
opinion of the astronomers without comment in his <i>Prognostications</i>.
Which suggests that clergy who practiced in
private arts of divination which they condemned in their
writings were not the only ones whose preaching and practice
might be divergent; Bernard defies astrological medicine
successfully in personal practice but he continues to
preach it in his writings. But to return to Arnald.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Operative
astrology
or magic.</div>

<p>Arnald believes that a human operator can accomplish
great things by availing himself of the influences of the
stars, an idea which he develops especially in the treatise
entitled, <i>De parte operativa</i>. In the first place, there is the
negative consideration that the force which pours forth unceasingly
from the stars is not absorbed unless bodies are
in a condition to receive it, and that they may be put into
such a favorable condition by art as well as by nature.
More positively, everything produced by art or nature receives
from the sky some property of acting upon other
bodies or of being acted upon by them. So any man who
knows the influences of the stars and how to prepare objects
to receive them, can produce great and marvelous changes
in inferior things. Arnald thinks that “the juggleries of
the magicians and the illusions of the enchanters” and the
operations of sorcerers and those who fascinate, have efficacy
in no other way, except of course as demons may lend their
aid. In other words, astrology is the basis of magic.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Seals or
images.</div>

<p>Arnald speaks particularly of gems to which either
Nature, the marvel-worker, or some erudite artist has given
efficacious powers by engraving them with images in accordance
with the constellations.<a id="FNanchor_2716" href="#Footnote_2716" class="fnanchor">[2716]</a> In his medical works he
states that a lion on a lead seal prevents one from feeling
pain in an operation for the stone,<a id="FNanchor_2717" href="#Footnote_2717" class="fnanchor">[2717]</a> and that an image of a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_858">[Pg 858]</span>
man holding a dead serpent in his right hand and its tail in
his left hand is an antidote for poison.<a id="FNanchor_2718" href="#Footnote_2718" class="fnanchor">[2718]</a> That Arnald also
employed such methods in actual medical practice is shown
from the fact that Pope Boniface VIII set great store by a
seal in the form of a lion which Arnald had prepared for him
when he was suffering from the stone.<a id="FNanchor_2719" href="#Footnote_2719" class="fnanchor">[2719]</a> Arnald’s separate
treatise on seals gives detailed directions for engraving one
for each sign of the zodiac. The following example is
typical of the others and also further illustrates Arnald’s
propensity to pious incantations: “In the name of the living
Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, take the purest gold and
melt it as the sun enters Aries. Later form a round seal
from it and say while so doing, ‘Arise, Jesus, light of the
world, thou who art in truth the lamb that taketh away the
sins of the world and enlighteneth our darkness.’ And repeat
the Psalm, <i>Domine dominus noster</i>. After doing this
much, put the seal away, and later, when the moon is in
Cancer or Leo and while the sun is in Aries, engrave on
one side the figure of a ram and on the circumference <i>arahel
tribus juda v et vii</i>, and elsewhere on the circumference let
these sacred words be engraved, ‘The Word was made flesh
and dwelt among us,’ and in the center, ‘Alpha and Omega
and Saint Peter.’” These instructions are perhaps some
relic of gnosticism. Arnald then states the virtues and
powers of the seal: “Moreover, this precious seal works
against all demons and capital enemies and against witchcraft,
and is efficacious in winning gain and favor, and aids
in all dangers and financial difficulties (<i>vectigalibus</i>), and
against thunderbolts and storms and inundations, and against
the force of the winds and the pestilences of the air. Its
bearer is honored and feared in all his affairs. No harm
can befall the building or occupants of the house where it is.
It benefits demoniacs, those suffering from inflammation of
the brain, maniacs, quinsy sore throat, and all diseases of
the head and eyes, and those in which rheum descends from
the head. And in general I say that it wards off all evils
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_859">[Pg 859]</span>
and confers goods; and let its bearer abstain as far as possible
from impurity and luxury and other mortal sins, and let
him wear it on his head with reverence and honor.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Experimental
method.</div>

<p>Arnald’s pages have supplied some evidence of the continued
vogue of that “experimental knowledge” and “experimental
science” of which Albertus Magnus and Roger Bacon
and others of the early thirteenth century wrote. In a passage
not yet noted<a id="FNanchor_2720" href="#Footnote_2720" class="fnanchor">[2720]</a> Arnald recognizes the difficulty of medical
experimentation and, like Petrus Hispanus and John of
St. Amand, makes some suggestions as to how it should
be conducted. They are, however, not novel. We have
also heard him speak of experimenters, of a “philosopher
and experimenter,” of “the long experience of any intelligent
operator”, and of “rational experiment” which “always
presupposes a determined object.” We have also heard
him admit that the occult virtues of natural objects can
be hit upon only by chance experiment or by some sort of
revelation. And since these last two channels are as open
to the common people as to the learned, it is possible that
knowledge of occult virtues should be attained sooner by
uneducated men than by others.<a id="FNanchor_2721" href="#Footnote_2721" class="fnanchor">[2721]</a> This is not necessarily
the case, however, and in a third treatise he speaks of a
truth having been verified by experience until it has come
to the notice of illiterate men and women. This truth is
that the weakened powers of age can to some extent be
restored, and as a proof of this assertion Arnald presently
adduces the invention of eye-glasses,<a id="FNanchor_2722" href="#Footnote_2722" class="fnanchor">[2722]</a> which are likewise
mentioned by his contemporary, Bernard Gordon.<a id="FNanchor_2723" href="#Footnote_2723" class="fnanchor">[2723]</a> We
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_860">[Pg 860]</span>
also have observed in Arnald the usual inclination to base
marvels upon experience, as in “the marvelous and elect
experiment” of Socrates or the cure of gout by binding on
frog’s legs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Further
foibles of
Arnald’s
medicine.</div>

<p>In conclusion some foibles of Arnald’s medicine may
be noted which do not exactly fall under any of the preceding
heads. In the treatment of mania in the <i>Breviarium</i>
he advises as a last resort that the skin be cut in the form
of a cross and the skull perforated so that the noxious
vapors may escape from the brain.<a id="FNanchor_2724" href="#Footnote_2724" class="fnanchor">[2724]</a> In another place he
warns against washing the head too often, “since thereby
many have lost their sight before their time.”<a id="FNanchor_2725" href="#Footnote_2725" class="fnanchor">[2725]</a> He advises
to lave the eyes not with cold but with tepid water, and
recommends as especially beneficial to the eyes washing
with one’s own urine when one rises from bed in the morning,
or with one’s own saliva. Throughout this same work
he repeatedly recommends the most awful concoctions as
remedies, but perhaps the climax in the way of a series of
complicated recipes occurs in his <i>Treatise against the Stone</i>,<a id="FNanchor_2726" href="#Footnote_2726" class="fnanchor">[2726]</a>
a disease for which he had treated the pope. In his collection
of antidotes<a id="FNanchor_2727" href="#Footnote_2727" class="fnanchor">[2727]</a> we again run across the Potion of St.
Paul and the opiates supposed to have been discovered by
the emperor Hadrian and the prophet Esdras.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
affair of
Bernard
Délicieux.</div>

<p>The trial of Bernard Délicieux<a id="FNanchor_2728" href="#Footnote_2728" class="fnanchor">[2728]</a> before the inquisition
should perhaps be mentioned at this point as a connecting
link between Arnald of Villanova of whom we have just
treated and Raymond Lull to whom the next chapter will
be devoted, especially as the tendency of this affair would
appear to be to bring both of them into disrepute with the
inquisition and under suspicion of magic. Thus two citizens
of Albi testified that on the eve of Benedict XI’s death
Bernard Délicieux or Delitiosi sent a leather chest wrapped
in waxed cloth to Arnald of Villanova at the papal court,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_861">[Pg 861]</span>
the imputation being that Arnald helped Bernard to poison
the pope. Furthermore, Bernard was found to have in his
possession a book of nigromancy which he said Raymond
Lull, a Catalan of Majorca, had given to him at Rome. No
doubt this evidence against Raymond and Arnald is very
flimsy; Bernard himself was freed of the charge of poisoning;<a id="FNanchor_2729" href="#Footnote_2729" class="fnanchor">[2729]</a>
still, it may have done them some harm.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Life and
works.</div>

<p>Ramon Lull or Raimond Lulle or Raymund Lull or Raymond
Lully, to mention some of the forms of his name
which have prevailed in different languages and times, appears
to have been one of the most energetic and versatile
characters of the thirteenth and early fourteenth century.<a id="FNanchor_2730" href="#Footnote_2730" class="fnanchor">[2730]</a>
Born in 1235 or 1236 or possibly a year or two earlier at
Palma in the island of Majorca, he seems to have spent
his youth as a pleasure-loving courtier, if not libertine, and
to have initiated by the composition of love verses the long
series of poems and treatises in Catalan which make
him a prominent figure in the history of medieval Spanish
literature.<a id="FNanchor_2731" href="#Footnote_2731" class="fnanchor">[2731]</a> At about the age of thirty he underwent a
conversion not unlike that of Saint Francis and thenceforth
devoted himself to learning and religion. This combination
was characteristic of him and he has been charged with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_863">[Pg 863]</span>
holding that all the mysteries of the Faith could be proved
and comprehended by reason and with “removing all distinction
between natural and supernatural truth.”<a id="FNanchor_2732" href="#Footnote_2732" class="fnanchor">[2732]</a> His
chief contribution to learning was the method of his Art,
of which more presently. But he was a voluminous writer
upon a great variety of themes, some of which border more
closely on the field of our investigation. Some of these
works at first sight may seem to have little connection with
what appears to have been Lull’s main object in life, namely,
the conversion of the Mohammedan world and the rescue
of the holy sepulcher.<a id="FNanchor_2733" href="#Footnote_2733" class="fnanchor">[2733]</a> But his crusading and missionary
methods were somewhat peculiar, involving not only a
long preparatory educational period, especially in the study
of oriental languages, but also the refutation of Arabian
philosophy, particularly that of Averroes, and toward that
goal the conciliation of philosophy and theology in the
Christian world. In 1276 he persuaded the king of Aragon
to establish a school for the study of Arabic in Majorca,
and in 1311 at the Council of Vienne he persuaded the pope
to authorize chairs in Greek, Hebrew, Chaldean and Arabic
at Rome, Paris, Oxford, Bologna, and Salamanca. He
failed, however, in his effort at this council to obtain a
prohibition of Averroistic teaching in Christian universities.
Lull himself, besides teaching in his own school in Majorca,
lectured on his Art at Paris, Montpellier and elsewhere. But
he also was an active field missionary, converting Saracens
not only in the Balearic Isles but also in Cyprus and
Armenia, while he went three times to North Africa. On
the first occasion he was imprisoned and then banished, on
the last he was stoned to death. This martyrdom, added
to his fame as a poet and scholar, has made him the national
saint of the Balearic Isles, but he actually has only been
beatified and not canonized. He appears to have been a
member of the third order of St. Francis. His will, drawn
up in 1313 and brought again to light in 1896, shows that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_864">[Pg 864]</span>
he had children.<a id="FNanchor_2734" href="#Footnote_2734" class="fnanchor">[2734]</a> His death occurred on the 29th of June,
1315.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Orthodoxy
questioned.</div>

<p>The chief reason why Lull has never been canonized is
the doubt that has prevailed as to his complete orthodoxy,
a matter more than once questioned. Eymeric (1320-1399)
when Inquisitor-General of Aragon attacked the doctrines
of Lull, listing five hundred passages in his works as heretical
and claiming that Gregory XI had condemned two hundred
in a bull of 1376,&mdash;which has not been found. It is
thought that the bull meant is one against a converted Jew,
Raymond of Tárrega who had turned renegade and written
works on magic. At any rate in 1386 another inquisitor
at Barcelona cleared the views of Lull from suspicion. The
University of Majorca established by King Ferdinand the
Catholic became a great center of Lullism. Then in the
middle of the sixteenth century Lull’s works were placed on
the <i>Index Expurgatorius</i>, but were removed before the close
of the century. It may seem strange that the relations
between Lullism and the Inquisition and Index were not
more cordial, since they are often both represented as pursuing
the same quarry, Averroism, of which we are told,
“Lullism always provided its strongest foes.”<a id="FNanchor_2735" href="#Footnote_2735" class="fnanchor">[2735]</a> But we
rather suspect that “Averroism” was in the nature of an
air-drawn phantom whose assailants were apt to injure one
another.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His natural
science
not unusual.</div>

<p>Probst regards Lull as in advance of his age in his use
of observation and experimental science and his knowledge
that the world was round and acquaintance with the
mariner’s compass.<a id="FNanchor_2736" href="#Footnote_2736" class="fnanchor">[2736]</a> This knowledge, however, he really
shared with his times and we can scarcely regard him as a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_865">[Pg 865]</span>
precursor of Columbus nor even quite as an equal of Roger
Bacon in these respects, exaggerated as we believe the estimates
to be which have often been made of Roger’s importance.
But Probst shows a similar tendency to exaggerate
the scientific importance of Lull at the expense of his period.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His Art
Universal.</div>

<p>Lull’s chief original contribution to medieval learning
bore scant relation indeed to the methods of observation
and experiment. His famous Art came to him as a sudden
inspiration in the midst of long study and reflection and was,
he and his followers believed, received by direct divine illumination.
Hence his title, “the illuminated Doctor.” In
reality the method of his Art leads us to infer that it occurred
to him by some process of sub-conscious association
with the employment of the planisphere in astronomy or the
use of a revolving wheel and tables of combinations of letters
of the alphabet such as we have noted in the geomancies
and modes of divination ascribed to Socrates, Pythagoras,
and other philosophers. Lull’s idea seems to have been the
invention of a logical machine which would constitute the
same sort of labor-saving device in a scholastic disputation
or medieval university as an adding machine in a modern
bank or business office. By properly arranging categories
and concepts, subjects and predicates in the first place,
one could get the correct answer to such propositions as
might be put. Another advantage of this method would
be that a sceptical Arab, who might refuse to listen to or
view with suspicion the verbal arguments of a missionary,
would be irresistibly convinced of the truth of the doctrines
of Christianity by this machine, or at least mechanical
method, which would impress him as impartial and reliable
Lull’s diagrams and mechanical devices included a tree, intersecting
triangles, and concentric circles divided into compartments,
of which one rotated something like the planet;
in the signs while the other remained stationary like the
sphere of the fixed stars.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Circular
figures
employed
in theology.</div>

<p>In questions of theology a circle was employed whose
center stood for God while its circumference divided into
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_866">[Pg 866]</span>
sixteen “chambers” representing kindness, grandeur, eternity,
power, wisdom, will, virtue, truth, glory, perfection,
justice, beneficence, pity, humility, dominion, and patience.
One hundred and twenty more “chambers” were formed by
combining pairs of the foregoing. Another circle shows
the rational soul in the center represented by four squares
and has its circumference divided into sixteen compartments
representing appropriate qualities. A third circle, devoted
to principles and meanings, enclosed five triangles in a
circumference of fifteen compartments; while a fourth circle
divided fourteen compartments of its circumference between
the seven virtues and seven vices respectively rendered in
blue and red. Other “figures” dealt with predestination,
fate, and free-will, truth, and falsity. The following is a
specific instance of the way in which these were combined.
When the rational soul is troubled and uncertain in the circle
of predestination, because the chambers of ignorance and
merit, science and fault, mingle together, it forms a third
figure representing doubt.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Figure of
a tree
used in
medicine.</div>

<p>In medicine the figure of a tree was employed. At its
roots a wheel divided into quarters signifying bile, blood,
phlegm, and atrabile. The tree had two trunks, on one of
which bloomed the principles of ancient medicine. Its first
branch, the natural, bore seven flowers: the elements, complexions,
humors, members, faculties, operations, and
spirits; and four figures dependent on these, namely, ages,
colors, shapes, and sexes. The second non-natural branch
produced six flowers: air, exercise, food and drink, sleep
and activity, emptiness and surfeit, and the accidents of the
mind. The third bough, or contrary to nature, had three
flowers: disease and its causes and results. The other main
trunk had two boughs. One divided into hot and cold, moist
and dry, and the four degrees of each. The other bore three
triangles and a square. The red triangle represented the
source, the middle, and the end; the green triangle stood for
difference, agreement, and contrariety; the yellow triangle
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_867">[Pg 867]</span>
comprised majority, minority, and equality.<a id="FNanchor_2737" href="#Footnote_2737" class="fnanchor">[2737]</a> The square
divides into four colors: red for being; black for privation;
blue for perfection; green for imperfection.<a id="FNanchor_2738" href="#Footnote_2738" class="fnanchor">[2738]</a> Such are
some of the diagrams of the Lullian art, intended presumably
to be worked by cranks or levers. There is really
nothing magical about them; they are purely mechanical
and representative and illustrative. But in their make-up
they are certainly suggestive of a Gnostic or Ophite diagram
or of a geomantic wheel, and possibly may sometimes
have been suspected of being magical by outsiders.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lull and
alchemy.</div>

<p>The use of the word “Art” for this logical machinery
and graphic method of Raymond Lull perhaps also led to
the notion that he was an alchemist and exponent of the
Hermetic art. Various works of alchemy were ascribed
to him but are regarded as spurious; perhaps some of them
are by the Jew, Raymond of Tárrega, already mentioned.
No work of alchemy is mentioned in the lists of his writings
drawn up in 1311 and 1314,<a id="FNanchor_2739" href="#Footnote_2739" class="fnanchor">[2739]</a> and the sixth part, devoted
to metals, of his <i>Libre de les Maravels</i> is unfavorable to
alchemy.<a id="FNanchor_2740" href="#Footnote_2740" class="fnanchor">[2740]</a> In his Latin <i>Questions Soluble by the Demonstrative
or Inventive Art</i> he again adduced reasons against
transmutation.<a id="FNanchor_2741" href="#Footnote_2741" class="fnanchor">[2741]</a> De Luanco has collected other passages
from Raymond’s undisputed works unfavorable to alchemy
and the alchemists.<a id="FNanchor_2742" href="#Footnote_2742" class="fnanchor">[2742]</a> We have seen, however, that a writer
may criticize most or all other alchemists sharply and question
various doctrines and methods of alchemy and yet have
his own way of getting around the difficulties whether
theoretical, such as the permanence of species, or practical.
There is therefore something to be said for the position of
Barber who, while recognizing that the treatises current
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_868">[Pg 868]</span>
under Raymond’s name are spurious, adds, “We can well
believe that he wrote as well as thought on alchemy.”<a id="FNanchor_2743" href="#Footnote_2743" class="fnanchor">[2743]</a> And
it was Berthelot’s opinion that while the works ascribed to
Raymond are spurious, “nevertheless it is incontestable
that those writings were composed by persons who believed
themselves his disciples.”<a id="FNanchor_2744" href="#Footnote_2744" class="fnanchor">[2744]</a> These spurious works were in
existence at an early date and Raymond is cited as an
alchemist from the fourteenth century on.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His attitude
to
astrology.</div>

<p>If Lull was an opponent of the art of transmuting metals
rather than an adept in alchemy, he was at least a believer
in astrology as several of his works show. It is true, and
this is the more important to note as suggesting how Lull’s
utterances on the subject of alchemy may also have been
misunderstood, that the <i>Histoire Littéraire de la France</i>,
in describing Raymond’s <i>Tractatus novus de astronomia</i>,
written in 1297, gives the impression that it is directed
against astrology, stating that Lull says that he has written
it “to dissuade princes and magnates from trusting in the
divinations of astrologers,” and adding, “Less worthy of
praise is the second part of the work where the author assumes
to apply to astronomy the principles of his art universal.”<a id="FNanchor_2745" href="#Footnote_2745" class="fnanchor">[2745]</a>
An examination of the treatise itself in manuscript<a id="FNanchor_2746" href="#Footnote_2746" class="fnanchor">[2746]</a>
shows that it is only of certain astrologers and
diviners who deceive princes by false judgments from the
stars that Raymond would have royalty beware. He writes
his book not because “astronomy” (i.e. astrology) is false
but because it is so difficult that often judgments made by
the art turn out false, and because he wishes to investigate
and discover new methods by which men can have greater
knowledge of “astronomy” and its judgments. When he
comes to speak of the properties of each planet, he remarks
that “astronomers” attribute many properties to Saturn but
do not prove them. He intends to employ his Art in investigating
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_869">[Pg 869]</span>
Saturn’s properties, and comes to the conclusion that
men born under that planet are, among other traits, ponderously
grave, suspicious by nature, disposed to toil and to
build great edifices, and ambitious to hold office.<a id="FNanchor_2747" href="#Footnote_2747" class="fnanchor">[2747]</a> Later
on we find him spending many pages in listing different combinations
of the planets in the signs as fortunate or unfortunate.<a id="FNanchor_2748" href="#Footnote_2748" class="fnanchor">[2748]</a>
All this, of course, is judicial astrology rather
than astronomy. He “proves” also that the sky is animated
by a moving and circular soul or spirit, and he states that
“astronomers” recognize in their judgments that this soul
of the sky is the cause of things caused in our inferior
world.<a id="FNanchor_2749" href="#Footnote_2749" class="fnanchor">[2749]</a> After a while, however, he does reprove “the
philosophers who invented the science of astronomy” for
“certain points in this science in which they have erred,”
namely, in making it necessary and inevitable. Lull holds
that God can alter nature as the smith alters the direction
of his falling hammer, and that the human mind has free
will to resist the influence of the stars.<a id="FNanchor_2750" href="#Footnote_2750" class="fnanchor">[2750]</a> But this criticism
of astrology is neither novel nor entirely justified. Lull
never disputes but always accepts the theory that the
heavenly bodies shed their influence and virtue upon inferiors.
He does, however, speak slightingly of the art
of geomancy and its practitioners.<a id="FNanchor_2751" href="#Footnote_2751" class="fnanchor">[2751]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">To the
condemnation
of
1277 at
Paris.</div>

<p>In the same year 1297 in which Raymond wrote the
treatise just summarized he also published an imaginary
dialogue dealing with the 219 opinions which had been condemned
at Paris in 1277.<a id="FNanchor_2752" href="#Footnote_2752" class="fnanchor">[2752]</a> In this dialogue “Socrates”
undertakes the defense of philosophy while Raymond supports
theology and the articles of condemnation. We have
seen that a number of the opinions condemned were astrological
in character. Raymond does not join in active condemnation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_870">[Pg 870]</span>
of all of these, passing over a number in silence
and perhaps intentionally evading them. On article 30,
“that superior intelligences create rational souls without
the motion of the sky; but that inferior intelligences create
the vegetative and sensitive souls by means of the motion
of the sky,” Raymond’s comment is that creation is the
proper function of God. To Socrates’ repetition of the
sixty-first article, “that God can do contrary things, that
is, by means of a celestial body which is diverse in its
whereabouts,” Raymond replies that God can act directly
and produce contraries without the intervention of any
heavenly body, if He wishes to, as He did in creating the
four elements with their contrary qualities of hot and cold,
dry and moist. Raymond adds, however, that God would
not produce sins, since He is perfect in goodness. In reply
to articles 92 and 102, that the heavenly bodies are moved
by a soul and by appetitive virtue just like an animal, and
that the soul of the sky is intelligence, Raymond answers
that in his opinion it is correct to say that the sky has a
motive soul but not a vegetative or sensitive or imaginative
or rational soul. “If, however, I am not speaking the truth
in this, I am prepared to receive correction; but I believe
that I am speaking truly.” Raymond also upholds human
free will as in the preceding treatise. The close of the
present dialogue is, at least on the surface, an edifying instance
of submission to ecclesiastical authority. Socrates
asks Raymond if the theologians believe as he has been saying.
Raymond replies that he believes so, since he has
proved his own statements and believes them to be true, and
he knows that the venerable lords and doctors of theology
who are pillars of the Christian Faith believe only what is
true. If, however, he has erred, it is unwittingly and unintentionally,
and he humbly supplicates those most powerful
masters to correct the words of their weak servant.
Socrates chimes in that he has merely been repeating for
his part what the ancient philosophers said, but that if any
of it is contrary to Christianity, he does not want to believe
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_871">[Pg 871]</span>
it. He therefore proposes that they go to Paris and
submit the book to the theologians there for their approval
or correction, as his desire is to see “great concord between
my lords the masters in theology and in philosophy.” It
seems evident that behind his humble tone Lull is trying to
soften down the condemnation of 1277 and substitute a
somewhat more conciliatory attitude.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The book
of Raymond
on
medicine
and astronomy.</div>

<p>Lull’s attitude to astrology is further illustrated by a
treatise in which he applies the method of his Art universal
to the subject of astrological medicine.<a id="FNanchor_2753" href="#Footnote_2753" class="fnanchor">[2753]</a> “Since the science
of medicine is very difficult on account of its principles being
so secret,” Raymond proposes to investigate them by means
of his Art. His treatise has three divisions: the first, concerning
the inferior world of the elements and the body of
the human patient; the second, concerning the regions of
the celestial bodies; and the third, consisting of questions.
Raymond denotes the four elements by the letters from a to
d, and the combinations of heat or cold with humidity and
drought by the letters from e to h. He then introduces a
figure with two circles representing the eighth sphere and
the zodiac, since the motion of the planets controls that of
the human body. These two circles are each divided into
eight “houses,” which correspond to sixteen pairs of letters
consisting of each of the four elements joined with
each of the four letters denoting pairs of qualities, namely,
ae, af, ag, ah, be, bf, bg, bh, ce, cf, cg, ch, de, df, dg, and
dh. Raymond then discusses such topics as fevers, the
pulse, evacuation, diet, bleeding, bathing, the color of the
urine, digestion and indigestion, pains, appetite, and the
method of grading medicines. The relation of his letters
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_872">[Pg 872]</span>
and “houses” to these matters may be seen from his statement
that the house of <i>ae</i> causes one kind of appetite, that
of <i>be</i> another, and so on. Coming to the second section of
his treatise, Lull treats of the planets and signs and relates
the conjunctions of the various planets with one another to
his eight letters and their combinations. In the third part
he puts illustrative problems and solves them by reference
to his preceding text.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An uncomplimentary
allusion to
thirteenth
century
medicine.</div>

<p>We might think Lull an opponent of medicine, if we
attended only to a passage in his <i>Contemplation of God</i>.<a id="FNanchor_2754" href="#Footnote_2754" class="fnanchor">[2754]</a>
Here he complains that doctors of the body are more sought
after, better paid, more scrupulously obeyed than are physicians
of the soul. They go well clad on good steeds, and
amass wealth by working all sorts of impositions upon
their patients, boasting of their knowledge of diseases of
which they are really ignorant, prolonging the period of illness
in order to increase their pay, and prescribing syrups
and the like in large quantities because they share in the
profits of the apothecaries. They try out potions on their
patients which they would never take themselves, and there
is no other art in the world so risky and over which there
is so much disagreement. These remarks of Raymond are,
however, the sort of satirical observations on medical practice
that might be made at almost any period, so that it is
difficult to tell if they are especially applicable to the thirteenth
century.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Necromancy
and
divine
names.</div>

<p>In closing we may note two brief indications of Lull’s
belief in two other occult subjects, namely, necromancy and
the power of divine names. Of necromancy he of course
did not approve but in the treatise just cited he adduces the
art of necromancy as evidence for the existence of God,
since it requires the services of demons and they are no other
beings than fallen angels who owe their existence to God.<a id="FNanchor_2755" href="#Footnote_2755" class="fnanchor">[2755]</a>
This somewhat tortuous theistic argument we have already
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_873">[Pg 873]</span>
heard advanced by Justin Martyr. In his treatise in Catalan
on <i>The Hundred Names of God</i> Raymond asks, “Since
God has put virtues in words, plants, and stones, how will
He not have put far greater virtue into His names?”<a id="FNanchor_2756" href="#Footnote_2756" class="fnanchor">[2756]</a></p>

<p><a id="Footnote_2730" href="#FNanchor_2730" class="label">[2730]</a> A number of works on Lull

the article “Lullists” in ERE. The
fullest discussion of Raymond’s

that in HL 29: 1-386, which

most accessible edition of the
works in print is perhaps that of

<div class="sidenote">Plan
of this
chapter</div>

<p>Peter of Abano, or Peter of Padua, as he was often
called from the larger city near his birthplace where he
did much of his teaching, was one of the most influential
men of learning during the last years of the thirteenth and
the opening years of the fourteenth century. Of his writings
in medicine, philosophy, and astronomy many are extant,
and most of these in printed editions. Yet he has never
been adequately or accurately treated in English. In our
language there have merely been brief notices of or incidental
references to him in histories of science and medicine,
or of the inquisition and of rationalism in Europe, or in
general encyclopedias. Such passages and parallel ones in
foreign languages<a id="FNanchor_2757" href="#Footnote_2757" class="fnanchor">[2757]</a> often give dates of Peter’s life or death
incorrectly, or do injustice to his opinions from an insufficient
or very indirect knowledge of his works, or represent
him as a victim of the Inquisition and an example of the
hostility of the medieval church to science to an extent which
the sources do not justify. There are, however, in European
languages, especially Italian, some secondary studies of
importance concerning Peter. It is upon these and a direct
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_876">[Pg 876]</span>
examination of his works that the present chapter will be
based. To avoid prolixity of text and footnotes, details of
bibliography<a id="FNanchor_2758" href="#Footnote_2758" class="fnanchor">[2758]</a> and a number of problems concerning his life
which require to be discussed at some length have been
transferred to appendices at the close of the chapter. In
the present text, since most of Peter’s works can be dated
rather exactly and since they were among the chief events
of his life, we may combine biography and bibliography in
large measure. We shall then treat somewhat, although
by no means adequately, of his place in the history of science,
and finally of his propensities toward astrology and
other varieties of magic.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Birth and
family.</div>

<p>Peter’s own statements in his chief work, the <i>Conciliator</i>,<a id="FNanchor_2759" href="#Footnote_2759" class="fnanchor">[2759]</a>
show that he wrote it in the year 1303, after having
worked it over in class-room lectures and discussions for
ten years previously, and that he was fifty-three years of
age at that time. In other words, he was born in 1250.
On one point of his biography more precise and scientific
detail is forthcoming than is customary in the lives of the
great men of the past, for he confides exactly how long a
time elapsed before his birth, nine months and fourteen
days, as he had learned by astrological scrutiny and from
his “most careful mother.”<a id="FNanchor_2760" href="#Footnote_2760" class="fnanchor">[2760]</a> In his will Peter gives his
father’s name as Constantius of Abano,<a id="FNanchor_2761" href="#Footnote_2761" class="fnanchor">[2761]</a> and he was probably
the notary of that name whose tombstone inscription
has been preserved.<a id="FNanchor_2762" href="#Footnote_2762" class="fnanchor">[2762]</a> Scardeone stated that Peter had one
son named Benvenuto,<a id="FNanchor_2763" href="#Footnote_2763" class="fnanchor">[2763]</a> whose name also appears in a list
of inhabitants of Padua in 1320<a id="FNanchor_2764" href="#Footnote_2764" class="fnanchor">[2764]</a> and who took part in
a street fight there in 1325.<a id="FNanchor_2765" href="#Footnote_2765" class="fnanchor">[2765]</a> Gloria was the first to call
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_877">[Pg 877]</span>
attention to two other sons, named Pietro and Zuffredo,
whose names appear together with their brother’s in deeds
of sale and of inheritance of November 19, 1318, and February
2, 1321. Gloria was of the opinion that these sons
were illegitimate, and Peter’s failure to make them his heirs
in his will may perhaps be so interpreted, but they are not
called natural sons in the documents.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Travels
abroad.</div>

<p>At some time of unknown date Peter was in Sardinia,
where he says he saw a case of poisoning from “Pharaoh’s
fig,”<a id="FNanchor_2766" href="#Footnote_2766" class="fnanchor">[2766]</a> and at Constantinople, where he discovered a volume
of the <i>Problems</i> of Aristotle, which he translated into Latin
for the first time. It was probably there too that he saw a
Greek version of Dioscorides arranged alphabetically&mdash;his
own edition of Dioscorides follows another text, the medieval
Latin version&mdash;and secured the works of Galen and
other treatises which Michael Savonarola<a id="FNanchor_2767" href="#Footnote_2767" class="fnanchor">[2767]</a> says that he
translated from Greek into Latin. Peter is also said to
have visited Spain, England, and Scotland, but I have found
no proof of this, although allusions to such visits may possibly
occur somewhere in his voluminous works.</p>

<div class="sidenote">At Paris.</div>

<p>A number of years of Peter’s life were spent at the
University of Paris, where Michael Savonarola states that
he was regarded as a second Aristotle and called “the great
Lombard.” There he wrote his work on Physiognomy
(<i>liber compilationis phisonomie</i>) which he dedicated to
Bordelone Bonacossi who was captain-general of Mantua
from 1292 to 1299. In the version which has reached us
and which is dated 1295 Peter alludes to an earlier draft
which had gone astray and had failed to reach its destination
in Italy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His Latin
version of
Abraham
Aben
Ezra.</div>

<p>In 1293 Peter found astrological writings of the Jew,
Abraham Aben Ezra, who had flourished at Toledo in the
twelfth century, defectively translated from Hebrew into
French,<a id="FNanchor_2768" href="#Footnote_2768" class="fnanchor">[2768]</a> and therefore published a Latin revision of his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_878">[Pg 878]</span>
own, apparently also adding treatises which had not been
included in the previous translation.<a id="FNanchor_2769" href="#Footnote_2769" class="fnanchor">[2769]</a> This raises the question
whether Peter was acquainted with Hebrew and
Arabic,<a id="FNanchor_2770" href="#Footnote_2770" class="fnanchor">[2770]</a> or whether he may have used a Greek version of
Abraham’s treatises in correcting the French one. At any
rate Peter’s Latin version of Abraham’s astrological works
had a widespread influence, as it was retranslated into various
European vernaculars and apparently even back again
into Arabic.<a id="FNanchor_2771" href="#Footnote_2771" class="fnanchor">[2771]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Conversation
with
Marco
Polo.</div>

<p>Peter talked with the famous oriental traveler, Marco
Polo, at some time between the latter’s return to Venice in
1295 and the completion of the <i>Conciliator</i>, in which he
cites Marco’s statements to him concerning tropical countries
near the equator.<a id="FNanchor_2772" href="#Footnote_2772" class="fnanchor">[2772]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Translations
from
the Greek.</div>

<p>A translation of the Problems of <i>Alexander medicus</i>
is ascribed to Peter in the list of his works in a fifteenth century
manuscript.<a id="FNanchor_2773" href="#Footnote_2773" class="fnanchor">[2773]</a> This can hardly refer to Alexander of
Tralles. Perhaps what is meant is a translation of the
Problems of Alexander of Aphrodisias, of which I know
only one manuscript where it is dated 1302. Savonarola,
however, states that Peter translated the Aphorisms of Alexander
and also the Rhetoric of Aristotle, but the latter translation
does not seem to be extant. Some at least of Peter’s
translations of Galen’s works would appear to have been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_879">[Pg 879]</span>
executed before 1303, since they are referred to by him in
the <i>Conciliator</i>. Also two of them are found in manuscripts
dated as early as 1304 and 1305, the latter containing Peter’s
completion of the translation of Galen’s <i>Therapeutic Method</i>
begun by Burgundio of Pisa.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Did he
teach at
Bologna?</div>

<p>This last manuscript was written at Bologna in 1305
and is about the only evidence we have to support the old
tradition, which was already questioned by Mazzuchelli, that
Peter taught at Bologna.<a id="FNanchor_2774" href="#Footnote_2774" class="fnanchor">[2774]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Return
to Padua.</div>

<p>Savonarola seems correct in stating that Peter completed
the <i>Conciliator</i> and began the composition of his
Commentary on the Problems of Aristotle at Paris, and the
<i>Explicit</i> of the latter work likewise states that Peter wrote
part of it in Paris and finished it at Padua in 1310. He
left Paris therefore at some time after 1303 and returned
to Padua at some time before 1310. Apparently he might
have been in Bologna in 1305 but in 1307 he is listed as a
member of a gild in Padua.<a id="FNanchor_2775" href="#Footnote_2775" class="fnanchor">[2775]</a> Grabmann in his recent researches
concerning the thirteenth century translations of
Aristotle has called attention to a translation of the History
of Animals made from the Greek in 1260 and of which
Peter of Abano purchased a copy in 1309 from Francesco
of Mantua for the price of seven Venetian <i>soldi</i>.<a id="FNanchor_2776" href="#Footnote_2776" class="fnanchor">[2776]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Three
works of
astronomy
and
astrology.</div>

<p>In the <i>Conciliator</i> Peter refers a number of times to
three works of his in the fields of astronomy and astrology,
namely, a treatise on the astrolabe, another on the motion
of the eighth sphere, and a work entitled <i>Lucidator</i>, of which
the preface and a few chapters are extant and which perhaps
was never finished, since such allusions to the work in the
<i>Conciliator</i> as I have noted are to these few chapters, while
from the nature of these same allusions to the <i>Lucidator</i> and
from its own preface one would expect it to be of somewhat
the same length as the bulky <i>Conciliator</i>, since it was to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_880">[Pg 880]</span>
discuss disputed points in the fields of astronomy and astrology
in the same way that the <i>Conciliator</i> discussed them in
the field of medicine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Publications
in
the year
1310.</div>

<p>But we now encounter the seeming difficulty that, while
both the <i>Lucidator</i> and work on the motion of the eighth
sphere are cited in the <i>Conciliator</i>, which was finished in
1303, they both mention 1310 as the date of their composition.
A further indication that the <i>Lucidator</i> was published
after the <i>Conciliator</i> is that in its preface Peter states
that its method and arrangement will be similar to those of
the <i>Conciliator</i>, which is also cited later in the text itself.<a id="FNanchor_2777" href="#Footnote_2777" class="fnanchor">[2777]</a>
Apparently, therefore, Peter had written first drafts of the
two astronomical works before he finished the <i>Conciliator</i>
in 1303, but did not complete or publish them until 1310.
In that same year, as we have seen, he completed his Commentary
on the Problems of Aristotle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Undated
and spurious
works.</div>

<p>No definite date can be assigned for some of Peter’s
works, namely, his continuation of the <i>Grabadin</i> of the
Arabian physician, Yuhanna ibn Masawaih, to whose second
book on remedies appropriate to diseases of particular parts
of the body he added a discussion of remedies for complaints
of the heart and digestive organs, and his edition
of the medieval Latin version of the <i>Materia medica</i> of
Dioscorides, of which we have treated in an earlier chapter.<a id="FNanchor_2778" href="#Footnote_2778" class="fnanchor">[2778]</a>
Peter is also credited with a Latin edition of the little tract
on astrological medicine, or prognostication of diseases according
to the motion of the moon in the signs; but a Latin
translation of the same work is also attributed to William
of Moerbeke who lived a little earlier. Some other medical
treatises that have been ascribed to Peter, like the Questions
on Fevers, listed in Mazzuchelli’s bibliography, are really
portions of the <i>Conciliator</i>. Works of geomancy and magic
attributed to Peter and probably spurious will be described
more fully later in connection with those subjects.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Closing
years of
his life.</div>

<p>It has been stated by more than one author that Peter
went to Treviso to teach medicine in 1314, but it is doubtful
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_881">[Pg 881]</span>
if he even received a definite call from that city, although
it had his name under consideration.<a id="FNanchor_2779" href="#Footnote_2779" class="fnanchor">[2779]</a> His salary at Padua
has repeatedly been stated at the high figure of five hundred
pounds or lire a month but this amount really represents
his annual stipend.<a id="FNanchor_2780" href="#Footnote_2780" class="fnanchor">[2780]</a> He must, however, have been fairly
well-to-do&mdash;we have hints that his practice was lucrative&mdash;for
in 1315 when he made his will he had not been paid
any salary for three or four years, and yet had considerable
property. Peter was dead before the close of 1318,<a id="FNanchor_2781" href="#Footnote_2781" class="fnanchor">[2781]</a> but
the apparent attribution of his work on poisons to Pope
John XXII<a id="FNanchor_2782" href="#Footnote_2782" class="fnanchor">[2782]</a> makes it seem that he lived beyond August,
1316. One manuscript of that treatise speaks of Peter as
acting dean of Montpellier at that time, but this is unlikely.<a id="FNanchor_2783" href="#Footnote_2783" class="fnanchor">[2783]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Relations
with the
church.</div>

<p>We have dubious stories and more reliable data to show
both that Peter had intimate and friendly relations with
popes, whom he seems to have served in a medical capacity
and from whom he received patronage and protection, and
on the other hand that he was in difficulties with the Inquisition.<a id="FNanchor_2784" href="#Footnote_2784" class="fnanchor">[2784]</a>
Besides the fact that his work on poisons was certainly
written for some pope, if not for John XXII, we
have the tale that he was physician to Pope Honorius IV
(1285-1287) and charged him one hundred florins a day.<a id="FNanchor_2785" href="#Footnote_2785" class="fnanchor">[2785]</a>
On the other hand, we have the assertion of Thomas of
Strasburg, Prior-General of the Augustinian Friars from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_882">[Pg 882]</span>
1345 to 1357 that he was present in Padua when the bones
of Peter of Abano were burned for his heretical errors, and
the statements of still later writers, which are perhaps after
all merely unwarrantable inferences from Thomas’s assertion
and from Peter’s own words in his will and the <i>Conciliator</i>,
that Peter died while under trial a second time by
the Inquisition, which had once before instituted proceedings
against him unsuccessfully. But these matters require a
longer discussion than seems advisable now and so will be
treated of more fully in Appendix VIII to this chapter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Great
reputation.</div>

<p>The promptness with which Peter’s works appeared in
book form after the invention of printing and the number
of times that the <i>Conciliator</i> and some others were reprinted
attest his long continued reputation and popularity as a
medical authority and man of broad general learning.
Regiomontanus, the renowned mathematician of the fifteenth
century, when lecturing on Alfraganus at Padua, delivered
a public panegyric upon Peter of Abano.<a id="FNanchor_2786" href="#Footnote_2786" class="fnanchor">[2786]</a> It was perhaps
to be expected that Michael Savonarola, grandfather of the
famous friar who tried to reform Florence and himself a
physician and medical writer of some note, should belaud
Peter in his work on the great citizens of Padua in the
past, which he wrote about 1445; and that these eulogies
should be repeated in such books as Scardeone’s <i>On the
Antiquity of the City of Padua</i>, Naudé’s <i>Apology for Great
Men who have been falsely suspected of Magic</i>, Tomasini’s
<i>Eulogies of Illustrious Men adorned with pictures</i>, and
Duchastel’s <i>Lives of Illustrious Physicians</i>. But Peter’s
reputation at the close of the middle ages is also attested in
a criticism of some of his views by Symphorien Champier
which was written in 1514 and is found appended to the
1526 edition of the <i>Conciliator</i>. Champier’s object is to
correct Abano’s errors, that is to say, those passages in the
<i>Conciliator</i> where he regards Peter’s views as bordering
too closely upon magic or of too extreme an astrological
character for a Christian. But he admits Peter’s great
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_883">[Pg 883]</span>
medical reputation, stating that the most learned physicians
praise the medical and philosophical views of the <i>Conciliator</i>
and that Peter is believed to have surpassed all other Christian
physicians in his study of medicine and advancement
of truth. But, as Horace says, even Homer nods; hence
Champier will correct Peter in a few points in order to
enable lovers of Peter’s doctrines to get the benefit of them
without falling into his occasional errors.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Not a
miracle
in a rude
age.</div>

<p>The writers of the Renaissance and of early modern
times became so enthusiastic over Peter of Abano, and at
the same time so failed to appreciate the character and accomplishments
of medieval learning in general, that they
were wont to depict him as a miracle of learning in a rude
age&mdash;just as more recent scholars have over-estimated
Roger Bacon’s superiority to his time&mdash;and to regard the
physician of Padua, like the author of the <i>Divine Comedy</i>,
as a precursor of their own period rather than as a final
representative and product of a rich earlier period of culture.
Thus Scardeone in the sixteenth century spoke of him as
the first medical translator from Greek into Latin since
Roman days, forgetting earlier medieval translators of
Greek medicine like Burgundio of Pisa and William of
Moerbeke. And in the seventeenth century Tomasini called
Peter “a man most illustrious, in genius, doctrine, and
merits, in a rude and unhappy age,” while Naudé declared
him “a man who appeared as a prodigy and a miracle in his
age.” This depreciation of the times in which Peter had
lived became accentuated, as in the similar case of Roger
Bacon, by the report that he had been persecuted by the
medieval church.</p>

<div class="sidenote">But completed
the
work of
his period.</div>

<p>As a matter of fact, as Dante really closed the medieval
period of the flourishing of vernacular literature and the
age of romance, so Peter of Abano came in a sense at the
close of a period or movement in the history of science. He
thus not unnaturally occupied himself especially in supplementing,
correcting, and reconciling the work of his predecessors.
Some works that had been unsatisfactorily translated,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_884">[Pg 884]</span>
he retranslated. Such important works of Aristotle,
Galen, and others as he could find that had not yet been
translated, he translated from Greek into Latin. He filled
in the missing portion of the medical work of Yuhanna ibn
Masawaih. And in his <i>Conciliator</i>, a tome of enormous bulk,
he endeavored to reconcile and harmonize the conflicting
opinions of the medical men and philosophers who had gone
before him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">No mere
compiler.</div>

<p>Pico della Mirandola at the close of the fifteenth century
made a trenchant criticism of Peter’s erudition, when he
characterized him as “a man fitted by nature to collect rather
than to digest.” But this judgment was also too severe,
for Peter was no mere compiler, but something of an experimental
astronomer as well as a painstaking and critical
translator, voluminous commentator upon Aristotle, and
great medical authority. In the <i>Conciliator</i> he makes several
references to his personal astronomical observations
and to other treatises which he has composed upon astronomical
topics and which are at least in part extant. He did not
hesitate to correct the astronomical calculations of Ptolemy,
and appreciated the margin of error in astronomical observations
caused by variations in the construction of instruments
as well as in their employment by the human
observer.<a id="FNanchor_2787" href="#Footnote_2787" class="fnanchor">[2787]</a> His <i>Lucidator</i>, we have seen, was intended to
parallel in the field of astronomy and astrology the achievement
of the <i>Conciliator</i> in that of medicine; but the portion
completed or extant is not a great addition to Peter’s science,
since it covers about the same ground already discussed in
portions of the <i>Conciliator</i> and more especially in the treatise
on the motion of the eighth sphere.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The <i>Conciliator</i>
his
masterpiece.</div>

<p>The <i>Conciliator</i> therefore remains his chief work and
the one for which he is most famous, his masterpiece and
most influential writing. Like the <i>Opus Maius</i> of Roger
Bacon, it to a large extent covers his views as expressed elsewhere
and is representative of his philosophy and learning
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_885">[Pg 885]</span>
as a whole. It is in many ways a valuable historical document,
providing a good example of scholastic method, a
broad picture of the state of medieval medicine, and much incidental
illustration of the more general knowledge of Peter’s
times, as when he alludes to the overland travelers and to
the ocean voyages of the thirteenth century. He learned
from Marco Polo that there was human life in the Antipodes,
he cites a letter of John of Monte Corvino from India “in
the coasts where lies the body of the Apostle Thomas,” he
alludes to the attempt of two Genoese galleys to reach India
by sea “almost thirty years ago”<a id="FNanchor_2788" href="#Footnote_2788" class="fnanchor">[2788]</a>&mdash;two centuries before
Vasco da Gama and Columbus. The <i>Conciliator</i> does not,
however, quite cover the entire field of medieval science.
The subjects of “geometry and perspective,” for instance,
Peter rather avoids, explaining, “The arguments taken from
the books of geometricians and students of perspective, such
as Euclid, Alhazen, and others, and marked out by letters
of the alphabet, I omit because most of those for whom I
am writing are unfamiliar with that sort of thing.”<a id="FNanchor_2789" href="#Footnote_2789" class="fnanchor">[2789]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Its
method.</div>

<p>The <i>Conciliator</i> is made up of over two hundred questions
or “Differences” which Peter and his associates have
been investigating publicly for the past ten years. Each
problem is stated and any doubtful terminology is explained;
the utterances of past authorities anent the question are
reviewed; the true solution is then reached and the reasons
for it given; fourth and finally, hostile objections are answered.
This rigid scheme of argumentation does not, however,
prevent Peter from indulging in a deal of rather
rambling digression. This makes a very long volume, especially
as supplementary questions or corollaries are added
to some of the two hundred odd <i>Differentiae</i>. Also it is,
like most works in scholastic form, hard and tiresome reading,
as one has to keep in mind all the authorities and objections
which Peter has cited and raised until he finally gets
around to answering them. Many of the questions concern
purely medical matters and admit little debate between
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_886">[Pg 886]</span>
philosophers and physicians. The first ten, however, deal
with general questions such as whether medicine is a science,
whether a doctor ought to be a logician, whether the
human body is amenable to medicine, and whether the physician
can help the sick by a knowledge of astronomy. Nearly
a hundred distinctions are then concerned with medical
theory concerning the elements, the physical constitution,
generation, the members of the human body, fevers, and
kindred questions. The last odd hundred distinctions deal
with matters of medical practice and personal hygiene.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Specimens
of its
questions.</div>

<p>The mere list of these questions is interesting and illuminating,
and a few of them may be reproduced here to show

<div class="sidenote">Was Peter
the founder
of
Averroism
at Padua?</div>

<p>Peter has often been called a disciple of Averroes and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_888">[Pg 888]</span>
the founder of Averroism in Italy at Padua,<a id="FNanchor_2792" href="#Footnote_2792" class="fnanchor">[2792]</a> but I have
noticed little in his works to substantiate this. Renan admits
that Peter knew neither the <i>Colliget</i> nor the medical works
of Averroes, while the doctrine of religious change according
to astrological conjunctions which he takes as a sign of
Averroism<a id="FNanchor_2793" href="#Footnote_2793" class="fnanchor">[2793]</a> in Peter came of course from much earlier
Arabian astrologers. Indeed, it would seem that most of
the points of view which are loosely designated by the word
“Averroism” had been common enough among earlier Arabic
writers and had even in considerable measure been taken
from other sources than Averroes himself by the Latin
world. Only if we accept the very dubious and loose assertion
of Renan that “medicine, Arabism, Averroism, astrology,
incredulity, became almost synonymous terms,”<a id="FNanchor_2794" href="#Footnote_2794" class="fnanchor">[2794]</a> can
we connect Peter of Abano with Averroism and even then
we have the obstacles that Peter often makes profession
of Christian faith and that Steinschneider asserts that he
made no translations from the Arabic.<a id="FNanchor_2795" href="#Footnote_2795" class="fnanchor">[2795]</a> And if astrological
medicine be Averroistic, Peter was certainly not the first
Averroist in Italy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reputation
for
magic.</div>

<p>Along with his reputation among the learned as a medical
authority Peter acquired a popular reputation as a magician
and nigromancer. This reputation had become established
by the middle of the fifteenth century, when Michael
Savonarola tells us that Peter’s great knowledge of astronomy
enabled him to make such predictions that men thought
he employed magic, and that the present tradition among
his fellow townsmen is that Abano was most skilled in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_889">[Pg 889]</span>
magic art. Of Peter’s astrological skill Savonarola tells the
story that, noting the approach of an unusually favorable
constellation, he advised the immediate building of a new
Padua in order to make her the queen of all cities. Similarly
Scardeone ascribed to Peter the idea of the numerous
astrological pictures illustrating the influence of the planets
and signs upon terrestrial life with which the ceiling of the
Palazzo della Ragione at Padua is adorned.<a id="FNanchor_2796" href="#Footnote_2796" class="fnanchor">[2796]</a> A different
story and on the whole perhaps the most incredible one is
told by Benvenuto of Imola,<a id="FNanchor_2797" href="#Footnote_2797" class="fnanchor">[2797]</a> perhaps seventy years after
Peter’s death. About to die, Peter said that his life had been
especially devoted to three noble sciences, of which one, philosophy,
made him subtle; the second, medicine, made him
rich; and the third, astrology, made him a liar.</p>

<p>But to return to Peter’s reputation as a magician. Savonarola,
whom we were quoting and who evidently has a
favorable opinion of magic, continues, “Moreover, this helps
to round out his teaching, nor is it contrary to his other
sciences, but makes the man the more illustrious.” Naudé,<a id="FNanchor_2798" href="#Footnote_2798" class="fnanchor">[2798]</a>
on the contrary, endeavored to exculpate Peter from the
charge of magic and regarded “the common opinion of
almost all authors” that he “was the greatest magician of
his age and learned the seven liberal arts from seven familiar
spirits whom he held captive in a crystal,” as a legend developed
from Peter’s astrological predictions and from his own
statements concerning incantations in the 156th <i>Differentia</i> of
the <i>Conciliator</i>. As for the story of seven familiar spirits,
already before Naudé Giovan Francesco Pico<a id="FNanchor_2799" href="#Footnote_2799" class="fnanchor">[2799]</a> had noted
the incongruity between the universal reputation of Peter of
Abano as a magician and the doctrine attributed to him that
there are no demons. Among the authors whom Naudé had
in mind was doubtless the learned Bodin who in the sixteenth
century declared that Peter of Abano was proved to have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_890">[Pg 890]</span>
been easily the chief of Italy’s magicians. Naudé admitted
that Peter had left treatises in physiognomy, geomancy, and
chiromancy, but held that he had then abandoned “the idle
curiosity of his youth to devote himself wholly to philosophy,
medicine, and astrology.”<a id="FNanchor_2800" href="#Footnote_2800" class="fnanchor">[2800]</a> We have already stated that
Champier’s criticisms of Peter’s teachings largely related to
astrology and magic. Let us now turn to Peter’s own works
and see what his attitude in regard to such matters really was.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Summary
of occult
science in
the <i>Conciliator</i>.</div>

<p>In the <i>Conciliator</i>, as in most of his writings, Peter manifests
a marked weakness for astrology and an extensive familiarity
with that art. His penchant displays itself in the
very prologue where he mentions “the power of genesis in
the stars” (<i>vim geneseos sydeream</i>) in stating that most
men are slaves not only in body but also in the nature of
their minds. Peter also occasionally displays a credulous
interest in dreams, fascination, incantations, and other varieties
of magic. The sections of the <i>Conciliator</i> in which he
has most to say of such matters are as follows. In the ninth
Difference, “Whether human nature is weakened from what
it was of old?” he appeals to astronomy and astrology for
support of his views and digresses to speak of his own astronomical
researches and publications and of the influence of
the stars. The tenth <i>Differentia</i>, “Whether a doctor to-day
can help the sick by his knowledge of astronomy?” discusses
at considerable length the arguments against the art
of astrology and argues in favor of astrological medicine.
Question one hundred and thirteen, “Whether natural death
can be retarded by any benefit?” involves further astrological
discussion. In Difference one hundred and fifty-six the
efficacy of incantations in medicine is considered. We shall
have occasion, however, to cite many other <i>Differentiae</i> than
these four.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Definition
of astronomy
and
astrology.</div>

<p>By Peter’s time the words “astronomy” and “astrology”
were beginning to be used in about their present meaning.
He is at pains to explain that their derivation from the
similar Greek words, <i>nomos</i> and <i>logos</i>, does not justify this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_891">[Pg 891]</span>
distinction. But he accepts the division of the science of
the heavens into two parts, one descriptive and dealing with
the measurement and motion of the stars, the other judicial
and studying their effects. This latter is subdivided as usual
into the branches of revolutions, nativities, interrogations,
and elections, which last includes the science of images. Conjunctions
go with revolutions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nature
controlled
by the
stars.</div>

<p>In the tenth <i>Differentia</i> of the <i>Conciliator</i> Peter lists and
replies to a number of arguments against the art of astrology,
such as that the distances involved are too great, the number
of stars too numerous, their influences too diverse and
conflicting, the instant of nativity too minute, to admit of
accurate calculation and prediction. These objections remind
us of those raised by Sextus Empiricus. Against such
objections Peter adduces not only arguments of his own, but
the opinions of philosophers, astrologers, and physicians.
All wise men agree, he says, that aside from God, the celestial
bodies are the first causes of happenings in this world.
Aristotle and the Commentator,<a id="FNanchor_2801" href="#Footnote_2801" class="fnanchor">[2801]</a> indeed, hold that God does
not act directly upon our lower world, and that all operations
here are through mediums and instruments; but the true
Christian Faith contends that the Creator can, if He will,
affect His creatures “immediately and without motion and
alteration.”<a id="FNanchor_2802" href="#Footnote_2802" class="fnanchor">[2802]</a> Of the general law, however, that the natural
world is universally controlled by the heavenly bodies there
can be no doubt in Peter’s opinion. In another chapter<a id="FNanchor_2803" href="#Footnote_2803" class="fnanchor">[2803]</a>
he cites in favor of this view the assertion of Hermes, Enoch,
or Mercury that each sand of the sea has its star influencing
it, and that of the <i>Centiloquium</i> ascribed to Ptolemy that the
face of this world is subject to the face of the heavens.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Astrology
a science.</div>

<p>The only question is, how far are we able to follow the
workings of this general law in individual cases? The perfect
astrologer would require a thorough acquaintance with all
the infinite detail of nature and the powers of mind and body.
Often therefore astrologers can only approximately and not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_892">[Pg 892]</span>
precisely predict what the stars signify. But the science of
astrology should not be abused because certain men who call
themselves astrologers or physicians but are really diviners
and liars err in their judgments. But astrology proper is
neither deceitful nor idle, and the astrologer “speaks the
truth in most cases and very rarely fails of correct prognostication
except in certain particulars.”<a id="FNanchor_2804" href="#Footnote_2804" class="fnanchor">[2804]</a> Peter’s confidence
in astrology despite the complexity of the problems involved
reminds one a little of the confidence of the political or social
scientist of the present in his methods compared to those of
the mere politician or indiscriminate philanthropist.</p>

<div class="sidenote">And not
magic.</div>

<p>Again in the first <i>Differentia</i> of the <i>Lucidator</i> Peter
argues the question whether astronomy or astrology is a science
and meets various arguments raised against the study
of the stars.<a id="FNanchor_2805" href="#Footnote_2805" class="fnanchor">[2805]</a> He holds that, while difficult and laborious,
it is noble and honorable, a beautiful discipline adapted to
the loftiest intellects, an entirely lawful and licit science.
Like Michael Scot, Peter lists and defines various other
arts of divination and magic in order to show that the science
of the stars is in no way superstitious, as some of them are,
and that it neither conjures spirits nor employs exorcisms
and suffumigations, as do some arts of divination which try
to justify themselves by claiming a connection with the
highly reputable science of the stars. Like Guido Bonatti,
Peter characterizes as “hypocrites” those who under pretense
of defending God’s prerogatives attack judicial
astrology as derogating from divine majesty and involving
necessity and compulsion. Those who detest such a science
should rather be detested themselves, he says, together with
those vulgar deceivers and charlatans whom they mistake
for astrologers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Occult
virtues
from the
stars.</div>

<p>Indeed, if the perfect astrologer should know nature and
man thoroughly, it is also true in Peter’s opinion that astrology
helps one to solve the problems of natural science.
“We see,” he writes,<a id="FNanchor_2806" href="#Footnote_2806" class="fnanchor">[2806]</a> “that precious stones and medicines
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_893">[Pg 893]</span>
have marvelous and occult virtues which cannot come from
the qualities and natures of the elements (constituting them),
since nothing acts beyond its species and every agent produces
an effect in matter commensurate with itself.” It
is useless to try to argue <i>a priori</i> from the qualities of the
constituent elements what these occult properties of particular
objects will be; they can be investigated only by experience.
And it seems evident to Peter that they can be accounted
for only as products of the influence of the stars.
Indeed, the same species of plant, grown under a different
quarter of the heavens, may acquire new virtues. All inferior
objects, he affirms in another chapter,<a id="FNanchor_2807" href="#Footnote_2807" class="fnanchor">[2807]</a> are filled by
the action of those superior bodies with demoniac functions
and virtues, so that Aristotle in <i>De coelo et mundo</i> says that
some of the ancients held that all these objects are full of
gods. An indeed suggestive passage from Aristotle, and
more so than Peter of Abano or the Stagirite himself realized,
tracing back the conception of occult virtue to its origin in
fetishism and animism, whence too the gods sprang!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Astrological
medicine.</div>

<p>Peter was convinced that a knowledge of astronomy and
astrology was not only valuable but necessary in the practice
of medicine. “Those who pursue medicine as they should
and who industriously study the writings of their predecessors,
these grant that this science of astronomy is not only
useful but absolutely essential to medicine.”<a id="FNanchor_2808" href="#Footnote_2808" class="fnanchor">[2808]</a> Peter cites
Hippocrates and Haly in his support and advises the medical
practitioner to look up the nativity of the patient, or, if this
is impracticable, to address an interrogation on the case to
an astrologer. By astronomy one can also foretell changes
in the weather and regulate the treatment of the case accordingly.
Diet and drink, purgatives and drugs, should all be
administered with due regard to the constellations. Two
<i>Differentiae</i><a id="FNanchor_2809" href="#Footnote_2809" class="fnanchor">[2809]</a> of the <i>Conciliator</i> discuss at length the theme
of critical days and their relation to the phases of the moon,
which planet, as Peter more than once explains, is assumed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_894">[Pg 894]</span>
to represent the influence of all the others, while to it is especially
delegated the control of generation and corruption.
The doctor should therefore keep his eye especially upon the
moon, a point further emphasized in the pseudo-Hippocratic
treatise of astrological medicine which Peter is said to have
translated. In still another chapter of the <i>Conciliator</i><a id="FNanchor_2810" href="#Footnote_2810" class="fnanchor">[2810]</a> the
question at issue is whether blood-letting is preferable in the
first or some other quarter of the moon. Surgeons, too,
should not operate when the stars are unpropitious and
should note the apportionment of the members of the human
body among the signs of the zodiac. When the patient’s
symptoms are ambiguous, the perplexed doctor may bridge
the gap in his medical prognostication by recourse to astrology.
This will tend to increase his reputation with his patients
who will marvel at his power of prognostication.
While thus discussing his tenth question, whether a doctor
should know astronomy, Peter adds that astrology is useful
in metaphysics as well as in medicine, giving as an example
the fact that Aristotle appeals to astrologers at one point of
his <i>Metaphysics</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The stars
and length
of life.</div>

<p>Peter more than once touches upon the influence of the
stars upon the length of human life: in Difference 9, for
example, where he is inquiring whether men lived longer
in ancient times than in his own day; in Difference 21, where
the point at issue is whether a temperate “complexion” is
more conducive to longevity, and where he indulges in considerable
detail about the control of the planets over the
process of generation; and in Difference 113, where the
question is whether there is any way of putting off natural
death. According to the astrologers, one hundred and twenty
years&mdash;the length of a greater solar year&mdash;was the natural
term of life, a considerable reduction from the age of the
patriarchs of the Old Testament, but much longer than most
men lived in Peter’s time. He thinks that the people of
India live longer because their climate is subject to Saturn.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_895">[Pg 895]</span>
In Difference 26 Peter divides the life of man into seven
ages under the seven planets.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nativities.</div>

<p>It is clear from many passages in the <i>Conciliator</i> that
Peter believes that much of a man’s life and character can
be inferred from his horoscope. The geniture of a prince
may involve the slaughter of vast multitudes in war, although
their own horoscopes may not have definitely indicated this
fate for them but only a certain inclination in that direction.<a id="FNanchor_2811" href="#Footnote_2811" class="fnanchor">[2811]</a>
Peter devotes considerable space and pains to the process of
generation and the problem of measuring the time of nativity.
He gives physiological explanations why twins, even
before birth, are not under the same astrological influence
and approvingly quotes the lines of Lucan:<a id="FNanchor_2812" href="#Footnote_2812" class="fnanchor">[2812]</a></p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Stant gemini fratres fecundae gloria matris</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Quos eadem variis genuerunt viscera fatis.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Revolution
of the
eighth
sphere.</div>

<p>In connection with the subdivision of judicial astrology
known as revolutions Peter was especially interested in the
motion of the eighth sphere of the fixed stars, concerning
which we have seen he wrote a distinct treatise<a id="FNanchor_2813" href="#Footnote_2813" class="fnanchor">[2813]</a> and of
which he treats in both the <i>Lucidator</i><a id="FNanchor_2814" href="#Footnote_2814" class="fnanchor">[2814]</a> and <i>Conciliator</i>.<a id="FNanchor_2815" href="#Footnote_2815" class="fnanchor">[2815]</a>
Ptolemy had reckoned that the sphere of the fixed stars
moved one degree in a hundred years and that consequently
the eighth sphere made a complete revolution every 36,000
years. Albategni’s estimate was 23,760 years for a complete
revolution or a motion of one degree in the course of sixty-six
years. Peter’s own calculation was that one degree was
accomplished in seventy years. He regarded this as a matter
of great importance because of the vast changes which
he believed the revolution of the eighth sphere brought about.
Its influence could even change dry land into sea, as the story
of the lost island of Atlantis showed. Peter mentions the
doctrine of the <i>magnus annus</i>, held by “certain Stoics and
Pythagoreans” that history would repeat itself as soon as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_896">[Pg 896]</span>
the eighth sphere had accomplished a complete revolution.
His own favorite theory, set forth three times in the aforesaid
three works, was that when the heads of the equinoctial
and tropical signs of the mobile zodiac come directly under
the heads of the same signs of the immobile zodiac in the
heaven of the fixed stars, then virtue from the First Cause
passes in a more perfect manner through the mediate causes
or heavens and men live longer and are stronger. For some
five hundred years before and after the period of exact coincidence
a golden age occurs, men of genius appear in large
numbers, and the world tends to unite under one government.
Such a period in Peter’s opinion was that of classical
antiquity, when there were great rulers like Darius, Alexander,
and Julius Caesar; great minds like Hippocrates,
Plato, Aristotle, Stoics and Peripatetics, Euclid, Abrachys,
Ptolemy, Galen, Cicero, and Vergil; and when both the Roman
law and the Christian religion were promulgated. But
then gradually, as the discrepancy between the mobile and
immobile signs increases, all is changed to the contrary, human
nature deteriorates, the span of life is shortened, monarchy
is corrupted, faith and law are made light of, the people
are oppressed, and true sages are rare indeed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Conjunctions.</div>

<p>In a number of places in the <i>Conciliator</i> Peter discusses
the subject of the effects of conjunctions of the planets. He
states<a id="FNanchor_2816" href="#Footnote_2816" class="fnanchor">[2816]</a> that very rarely at long intervals of time, when a
greatest conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter occurs in the
beginning of the sign of the ram, a well-balanced type of
constitution<a id="FNanchor_2817" href="#Footnote_2817" class="fnanchor">[2817]</a> is produced, but never more than a single specimen
at one time. Such a man becomes “a prophet, introducing
a new law or religion, and teaching sages and men.”
Such a man, according to Isaac Amaraan, Avicenna, and Algazetes,
is midway between angels and sages, and some say
that Moses and Christ were such men. Peter also hints at a
coincidence between the length of time that astrology teaches
that such a perfectly proportioned physical constitution will
last and the duration of Christ’s life. Champier included
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_897">[Pg 897]</span>
this passage in his list of Peter’s errors. Champier further
attacked the astrological doctrine of great conjunctions and
censured Peter for connecting Noah’s flood and the advent
of Mohammed with them. In another passage<a id="FNanchor_2818" href="#Footnote_2818" class="fnanchor">[2818]</a> concerning
this same conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in the first degree
of <i>Aries</i><a id="FNanchor_2819" href="#Footnote_2819" class="fnanchor">[2819]</a> Peter asserted that it not only altered the
strength of human nature and affected the length of life but
produced new kingdoms and religions, as in the case of the
respective advents of Moses, Nebuchadnezzar, Alexander
the Great, Christ, and Mohammed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The astrological
interpretation
of
history.</div>

<p>This astrological interpretation of history Peter carries
out in further detail. As he had divided man’s life into
seven ages, so he distributed periods of history among the
seven planets. Each presides in turn over human affairs
for a period of 354 years and four lunar months, a term
analogous to the number of days in the lunar year. When
Mars governed the world, the flood occurred because of a
greatest conjunction of the planets in the sign <i>Pisces</i>. Under
the Moon’s supremacy happened the dispersion of tongues,
overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, and escape of the children
of Israel from Egypt. Peter also alludes to the less
significant minor conjunctions which happen every twenty
years, to the moderate ones which take place every 240 or
260 years, and to the effects following eclipses. A solar
eclipse seventy years ago, he says, was followed by sterility
of the soil, movements of phantasms and of good demons
and bad demons, intercourse of incubi and succubi, a weakening
of human nature and increase of avarice and cupidity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Chronology.</div>

<p>The chronology of some of Peter’s astrological periods
of history has been sharply criticized. Thus Lea remarks,
“Even worse was his Averrhoistic indifference to religion
manifested in the statement that the conjunction of Saturn
and Jupiter in the head of Aries, which occurs every 960
years, causes change in the monarchies and religions of the
world as appears in the advent of Moses, Nebuchadnezzar,

Alexander the Great, Christ, and Mahomet&mdash;a speculation
whose infidelity was even worse than its chronology.”<a id="FNanchor_2820" href="#Footnote_2820" class="fnanchor">[2820]</a> The
printed editions of the <i>Conciliator</i> which I have consulted
also give the time as 960 years, but it would seem as if the
figure must have been wrongly copied in or from the manuscripts,
since in the <i>Lucidator</i>,<a id="FNanchor_2821" href="#Footnote_2821" class="fnanchor">[2821]</a> which I have examined in
manuscript, Peter shows acquaintance with different systems
of chronology, stating, for example, that Ptolemy and Galen
flourished under Antoninus Pius in the year 886 of the era
of Nebuchadnezzar or in 141 A. D. Peter therefore would
appear to have known perfectly well that no such period as
960 years had elapsed between the time of Nebuchadnezzar
and Christ, to say nothing of Alexander and Christ. In
another passage of the <i>Conciliator</i>,<a id="FNanchor_2822" href="#Footnote_2822" class="fnanchor">[2822]</a> moreover, Peter explains
that conjunctions may precede by many years the events
which they signify and produce but which are long in the
making. Thus the conjunction for the flood preceded it by
287 years and the conjunction connected with Mohammed
came fifty years before him, as Albumasar and Alchabitius
state. In his treatise on the eighth sphere Peter stated that
his theory of its motion and influence holds good independently
of the question whether the world is eternal, as all the
philosophers except Plato held, or had a beginning and when
that beginning was. He gives, however, a list of various estimates
of the number of years since creation, such as Bede’s
estimate of 5259; Abraham Judaeus’ of 5071; the Septuagint,
7270; Josephus, 5262; and so on up to the enormous
figure of 1,474,346,290 years given by the Indians and
Persians.<a id="FNanchor_2823" href="#Footnote_2823" class="fnanchor">[2823]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Astrological
images.</div>

<p>Peter believed not only that astrologers could predict
the future with considerable assurance of success, but also
that they could influence the future to suit themselves and
perhaps change threatening misfortune into good fortune by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_899">[Pg 899]</span>
applying to earthly objects the occult virtue of the heavenly
bodies. The way to capture and store up such celestial influence
is by means of images made by human art with due
reference to the constellations. Of such astrological images
Peter speaks frequently in the <i>Conciliator</i>.<a id="FNanchor_2824" href="#Footnote_2824" class="fnanchor">[2824]</a> Physicians are
advised to construct such images at the proper time when
“the vivifying and health-exciting celestial light” will flow
freely into them, as is illustrated by the astronomical images
of Ptolemy, Thebith ben Chorat, and others. The figure of
a scorpion made as the moon is leaving the sign of the scorpion
cures that reptile’s bite.<a id="FNanchor_2825" href="#Footnote_2825" class="fnanchor">[2825]</a> Human life can be prolonged
by such images which add to the influx of astral force received
at birth.<a id="FNanchor_2826" href="#Footnote_2826" class="fnanchor">[2826]</a> On the other hand, Peter elsewhere states
the theory that the impulse to construct an image was received
at birth from the stars,<a id="FNanchor_2827" href="#Footnote_2827" class="fnanchor">[2827]</a> and so does not really alter their
influence. He usually, however, speaks as if the employment
of images was a matter of choice. They are more often
made by night than by day, so that the rays of the sun may
not obscure and dissolve those of the other heavenly bodies.<a id="FNanchor_2828" href="#Footnote_2828" class="fnanchor">[2828]</a>
The astronomers of India employ allegorical images.<a id="FNanchor_2829" href="#Footnote_2829" class="fnanchor">[2829]</a> Peter
himself “has tested to remove pain in the intestines the figure
of a lion impressed on gold when the sun was in mid-sky,
with the heart of a lion, when Jupiter or Venus was in aspect
and the evil unfortunate stars were declining.” He bound
this amulet “on the bare flesh with a string made of sea calf’s
hide and a clasp from the bone of a male whale.”<a id="FNanchor_2830" href="#Footnote_2830" class="fnanchor">[2830]</a> What
could be more magical? In another passage Peter notes that
theologians attribute the efficacy of such images to demons,
but he sets aside this suggestion as not in accord with his
present method, which apparently takes into account only
natural and not spiritual forces, although he suggests that
the celestial light and force may be regarded as the instruments
of intelligences.<a id="FNanchor_2831" href="#Footnote_2831" class="fnanchor">[2831]</a> In the <i>Lucidator</i> Peter makes much
the same distinction between astronomical and necromantic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_900">[Pg 900]</span>
images as Albertus Magnus had made in the <i>Speculum
astronomiae</i>. Notes by Peter on astrological images are contained
in the <i>Astrolabium planum</i>, published in 1488.<a id="FNanchor_2832" href="#Footnote_2832" class="fnanchor">[2832]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The stars
and invocations,
incantations,
and
fascination.</div>

<p>Peter refers twice in the <i>Conciliator</i><a id="FNanchor_2833" href="#Footnote_2833" class="fnanchor">[2833]</a> to his success with
an invocation to God to acquire knowledge, when the head
of the dragon and Jupiter were together in mid-sky and the
moon was approaching them. He also cites <i>Albumasar in
Sadam</i> for a similar practice by “the kings of the Greeks,”
when they wished to ask God for anything. Elsewhere<a id="FNanchor_2834" href="#Footnote_2834" class="fnanchor">[2834]</a> he
states that the defenders of fascination and incantations aver
that their potency consists in the virtue which the soul of the
operator receives from the stars, just as an image receives
their motion and light. The horoscope of the person uttering
the invocation is a factor of some importance, but not
the preponderating influence.<a id="FNanchor_2835" href="#Footnote_2835" class="fnanchor">[2835]</a> Not a few of the Magi invoke
Jupiter, Saturn, or another heavenly body by the name
of the intelligence which guides it.<a id="FNanchor_2836" href="#Footnote_2836" class="fnanchor">[2836]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Stars and
spirits.</div>

<p>This last passage and one or two others already cited
show that Peter was inclined to associate spirits and intelligences
with the heavenly bodies. Once he describes a celestial
body as “perpetual and incorruptible, leading through
all eternity a life most sufficient unto itself, nor ever growing
old.” In the same chapter<a id="FNanchor_2837" href="#Footnote_2837" class="fnanchor">[2837]</a> he tells us that when Aristotle
wished to investigate the number of Intelligences, he
betook himself to two famous astrologers and according to
the number of spheres as stated by them calculated the number
of Intelligences. In the preceding chapter<a id="FNanchor_2838" href="#Footnote_2838" class="fnanchor">[2838]</a> he had repeated
from Averroes the following association of seven intelligences
or angels with the planets: Saturn and Cassiel,
Jupiter and Sachiel, Mars and Samael, the Sun and Michael,
Venus and Anael, Mercury and Raphael, the Moon and
Gabriel.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Were
Peter’s
views
heretical?</div>

<p>This passage and Peter’s invocation are a dangerously
close approach to astrological necromancy. Enough so perhaps
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_901">[Pg 901]</span>
to justify the reproach which Champier repeated from
some “recent authority” that Peter borrowed a great deal
from Picatrix, “a very idle book full of superstitious prayers
to planets and evil spirits.” Champier, however, cited no
specific passages to substantiate this charge, and I doubt if it
can be shown that the <i>Conciliator</i> either cites or makes unacknowledged
quotation from Picatrix. It will also be observed
that Peter does not assert that the stars themselves
are spirits or intelligences or gods, and that both Aquinas
and Albert were inclined to agree that angels or heavenly
intelligences moved the stars. That Peter’s views were objectionable
to some persons, however, is indicated by the
closing passage of this ninth <i>Differentia</i>, in which he has
associated seven spirits with the planets, the rise of prophets
and new religions with great conjunctions, and activity of
demons with solar eclipses. Some malicious persons have
long troubled him, he says, but his utterances in nothing
derogate from divine wisdom but rather confirm it, and at
last an apostolic mandate has snatched him and his truth
from the hands of his detractors. In other words, the pope
has protected him. Peter’s astrology sometimes seems to
show scant regard for human free will, but he recognized
it as an essential Christian doctrine.<a id="FNanchor_2839" href="#Footnote_2839" class="fnanchor">[2839]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Fascination.</div>

<p>Peter alludes several times<a id="FNanchor_2840" href="#Footnote_2840" class="fnanchor">[2840]</a> to the subject of fascination
in connection with images and incantations. It seems evident
that he is here trying to account among other things
for hypnotic power. In the <i>Lucidator</i> he defines <i>maleficium</i>,
the usual word for sorcery, as a sort of fascination, “taking
possession of one’s powers so that one loses self-control,”
and “impeding sexual intercourse.”<a id="FNanchor_2841" href="#Footnote_2841" class="fnanchor">[2841]</a> In opposing the theory
that vision is by extramission of rays Peter explains the
deadly glance of the basilisk as due to corrupting vapor and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_902">[Pg 902]</span>
not to visual rays, and fascination as caused by some more
occult force than the evil eye in a literal sense.<a id="FNanchor_2842" href="#Footnote_2842" class="fnanchor">[2842]</a> And when
arguing that the confidence of the patient in the doctor is a
factor in the cure Peter emphasizes the power of a strong
will impressed in an occult fashion.<a id="FNanchor_2843" href="#Footnote_2843" class="fnanchor">[2843]</a> Some men, it is true,
like the followers of Asclepius, deny any virtue of the mind
and regard their fellow-men as swayed like beasts by the
passions of the senses, deeming wisdom, sobriety and continence
a jest, calling human affection and altruism into
question, and further despising dreams, divinations, prudent
counsels and the whole subject of astrology. But Peter believes
in the power of one mind over another or over matter.
Such a mind can cure the sick or even cast a man into a
well or cause a camel to enter a Turkish bath (<i>caldarium</i>).
It is also one of the causes of prophetic power. The believers
in fascination and incantations say that such marvelous virtues
of the mind are derived from the stars. But Christians
regard prophetic power as directly inspired by God, an opinion
which seems ridiculous to the Peripatetics.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Incantations.</div>

<p>In much the same way Peter discusses incantations.<a id="FNanchor_2844" href="#Footnote_2844" class="fnanchor">[2844]</a> He
lists several definitions of an incantation, such as that ascribed
to Socrates, “words deceiving human minds,” or “an
utterance put forth with astounding influence in aid of an
enchanted person who is especially confiding,” or “an utterance
at discretion of meaningless words, which since it has
to do with the strange and occult is esteemed the more by
the person enchanted and so helps him the more.” An incantation
may be either spoken, or written and bound on the
body. The enchanter should be astute, credulous, and strong-willed;
the person enchanted should be eager, hopeful, and
disposed in every way to forward the success of the operation.
Incantations are especially effective in sleep or in the
case of women and simple folk who have the more faith in
them. Peter tells an amusing anecdote of a noble who taught
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_903">[Pg 903]</span>
a poor old woman to repeat as an incantation the sentence,
“Two and three make five and so do three and two.” He
thought her a witch, however, and when a fish bone stuck fast
in his throat, sent for her to remove it. When he found that
she really knew no magic except the absurd incantation which
he had himself taught her, he laughed so heartily that the
bone was dislodged and he was thus cured by his own incantation
after all.</p>

<p>All this sounds rather sceptical on Peter’s part, and he
also recalls Galen’s detestation of certain medical authors
who wrote down superstitious words and fables such as old-wives
and witches are wont to repeat and stupid gypsies who
utter fascinations. “For they conjured and sprinkled and
suffumigated medicines as if divine, when they plucked the
herbs from the soil or when they suspended them about the
neck or elsewhere like a phylactery, all which is false and
stupid and offensive to the art of medicine.” But while
Peter joins in condemnation of such superstitious medicine,
he yet believes in the efficacy of incantations and represents
their opponents as incredulous and materialistic persons who
will accept only action by gross material contact. He admits
that there is no property in the incantation itself nor in its
sound when uttered to explain its marvelous effects. We
must look rather to the virtue of the mind of the person
repeating the charm, to faith on the part of the person to be
benefited, and to divine, angelic, demonic, or sidereal assistance.
At any rate experience demonstrates the validity of
incantations and spoken words, as in the case of the Eucharist,
or of the divine names employed in the notory art, or
the restoration to life of a dead man which was performed
in Peter’s presence by magic words which the enchanter
uttered in the ear of the corpse. Peter goes on to speak
of the movement of the holy wafer or Psalter or sieve
towards a thief who enters a church. Other wonders
wrought by incantations which he lists are the ability to
endure torture without giving signs of pain or to walk
over sharp swords and hot coals without injury, to lift
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_904">[Pg 904]</span>
another man or raise a great weight with a single finger,
to stupefy snakes and tame wild horses, cause insomnia,
reveal the future, painlessly extract arrows that are so
deeply embedded in the bone that they could not be pulled
out. Paroxysms of epilepsy may be quieted by pronouncing
the names of the three Magi in the patient’s ear. Peter also
repeats the cure for epilepsy found in so many medieval authors
and involving religious ceremonial and repetition of
a verse from the Bible. Anent Peter’s allusion to the employment
of divine names in the notory art, we may note
that a work on that subject is listed among evil books in his
<i>Lucidator</i>.<a id="FNanchor_2845" href="#Footnote_2845" class="fnanchor">[2845]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Number
mysticism.</div>

<p>The superstitious esteem for certain numbers which prevailed
both in ancient and medieval times does not pass unnoticed
in the <i>Conciliator</i>. Arguing the question whether
the child born in the eighth month will live,<a id="FNanchor_2846" href="#Footnote_2846" class="fnanchor">[2846]</a> Peter discusses
the subject of perfect and imperfect numbers for three columns,
stating that this is the doctrine of Pythagoras and
of arithmeticians in general. In a later chapter,<a id="FNanchor_2847" href="#Footnote_2847" class="fnanchor">[2847]</a> however,
he declares that natural phenomena cannot be proved by
arithmetical numbers since they are not caused by them,
and alludes to Aristotle’s strictures upon Pythagoras.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Poisoning
and magic.</div>

<p>Poisoning and magic were often scarcely distinguished in
antiquity. The Greek word φάρμακον and the Latin <i>veneficium</i>
or <i>veneficus</i> might have reference either to poisoning
or sorcery, either to a poisoner or enchanter. Plato states
in his <i>Laws</i><a id="FNanchor_2848" href="#Footnote_2848" class="fnanchor">[2848]</a> that there are two kinds of poison employed
by men which cannot be clearly distinguished, although one
variety injures the body “according to natural law,” while
the other “persuades overbold men that they can work injury
by sorceries and incantations.” The Latin poet Lucan
centuries later drew a sharper distinction when he declared,
“The mind which is enchanted perishes without foul trace
of poisoned draught,” and this dictum we have found embodied
in more than one medieval definition and description
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_905">[Pg 905]</span>
of magic. However, all magic is not enchantment; the poisoner
and magician worked in the same secret and sinister
style, sought similar injurious ends, and availed themselves
of the same powerful occult virtues in natural objects. Poisoning
and bewitching seemed very similar processes, especially
at a time when men believed in the existence of poisons
which could act at a distance or after a long interval of time.
In one passage of the <i>Conciliator</i><a id="FNanchor_2849" href="#Footnote_2849" class="fnanchor">[2849]</a> Peter uses the word <i>veneficus</i>
rather in the sense of an enchanter or magician than a
poisoner, when he says that, if you wish to injure another
person or to make him love you, the <i>venefici</i> direct you to
gaze fixedly at him at the same time uttering a certain incantation.
But let us now turn to the treatise <i>De venenis</i>, in
which Peter has much more to say on the subject of poisons.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The treatise
<i>De
venenis</i>.</div>

<p>It will be recalled that Peter’s treatise on poisons was
written for the pope. The topics considered in its six main
chapters are: the classification of poisons, how they act upon
the body, how to guard against them, the effects and cures
of a long list of particular poisons, and finally the problem of
a panacea or <i>bezoar</i> against all poisons. Peter classifies poisons
according as they come from animals, vegetables, or
minerals, and as they take effect internally or externally.
Those which take effect internally are usually administered
in food or drink, or swallowed without admixture. But one
may be poisoned externally not only by contact, as in the case
of snake-bite, but through the sense of sight, as when the
glance of the basilisk kills, and through the sense of hearing,
as when the <i>regulus</i><a id="FNanchor_2850" href="#Footnote_2850" class="fnanchor">[2850]</a> kills bird or beast by its hiss. In fact,
poisoning may be through any one of the five senses. Some
snake-bites Peter classifies under the sense of taste rather
than touch. Other serpents emit a poisonous odor, or kill a
person who touches them only with the tip of a long lance.
The hands and arms of fishermen become paralyzed when
they take hold of nets in which a certain fish has become
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_906">[Pg 906]</span>
entangled. These last are perhaps exaggerated accounts
based upon electrical shock.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Specific
form or
valence.</div>

<p>Poisons may also be classified according to the form of
their species (<i>forma specifica</i>). Some prove fatal owing to
the excessive preponderance of one quality, being excessively
hot or cold or moist or dry. Others are deadly because their
entire composition, the very form of their species, is fatal.
Peter then gives an interesting definition of this “specific
form.” “It is nothing else than the value or valence (<i>meritum</i>)
which any object composed of the four elements acquires
from the proportions of those elements existing in
this compound and from the influence of the fixed stars which
regard the species of inferior compounds.” Through the
light of the stars streaming down in straight lines pyramids
of astral force concentrate upon terrestrial objects,&mdash;the
same doctrine of stellar rays, emanation, and multiplication
of species that we have met already in Alkindi, Grosseteste,
and Roger Bacon. Peter adds that this specific form of any
compound is not easy to discover except as human experience
gradually reveals it empirically, “because we do not
know and we never shall know the quantities and the weights
of the elements in the compounds.” That is to say, Peter
sees the desirability but despairs of the possibility of any
such discovery as that of atomic weights and valences, and
consequently of a true science of chemistry. His despair
is not surprising in view of the fact that medieval men were
still trying to conduct their scientific researches upon the outworn
Greek hypothesis of only four elements, earth, air, fire,
and water, all of which are really compounds and indeed in
the middle ages were not supposed to be ever found in their
pure state. Desperation like Peter’s was needed before
science could be induced to take a fresh start, and, like
Arnald of Villanova, he is to be given credit for an approach
to the chemical conception of valence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An
allusion to
alchemy.</div>

<p>With the subject of alchemy, it may be remarked in
passing, Peter appears to have had little to do, and not even
any spurious treatises on the subject are extant under his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_907">[Pg 907]</span>
name, as they are in the cases of Albertus Magnus, Thomas
Aquinas, Roger Bacon, Arnald of Villanova, and Raymond
Lull. Colle,<a id="FNanchor_2851" href="#Footnote_2851" class="fnanchor">[2851]</a> however, noted a passage in the <i>Conciliator</i><a id="FNanchor_2852" href="#Footnote_2852" class="fnanchor">[2852]</a>
where Peter speaks of two friends of his who had told him
that they had succeeded “by the art of decoction” in making
silver which was true to every examination but from which
they had not profited much openly.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mineral,
vegetable,
and
animal
poisons.</div>

<p>In his second chapter Peter discusses various mineral,
vegetable, and animal poisons under the caption, “Of each
poison in particular” (<i>De unoquoque veneno in speciali</i>).
Quicksilver made by the art of alchemy he declares a more
deadly poison than natural mercury. He is either an early
advocate of inoculation and homeopathy, or else is guilty
of silly reasoning based upon sympathetic magic, when he
states that the magnet taken internally produces melancholy
and lunacy and that doctors employ it with other medicines
to cure melancholy. Incidentally he mentions two kinds of
magnet, one which attracts iron toward the north pole, another
which draws human flesh toward the south pole. Vegetable
poisons may be the juices of herbs, the fruit of trees,
or seeds. Some animals have poison in their brains; some, in
their tails; some, in the blood; some, in the saliva and spittle;
some, in the gall; and some, in their entire bodies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How poison
takes
effect.</div>

<p>The question, how poison takes effect upon the human
body, occasions Peter considerable difficulty, since he is unwilling
to admit either that the heart naturally attracts poison
or that poison runs naturally to the heart. Avicenna says
that a man with a hot heart offers the best resistance to poison,
but Peter adds that much depends upon the human soul
and the constellations. He notes that the action of poison
is very similar to that of medicine and thinks that the art of
medicine was suggested by the action of poisons. Incidentally
he repeats from his authorities statements that there are
trees whose shade is poisonous to sleep in or to bathe beneath,
and that a man was killed by the vapor from wood cut
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_908">[Pg 908]</span>
near the caverns of serpents which was used as fuel in heating
his bath. He also repeats the tale of Socrates and the
dragon.<a id="FNanchor_2853" href="#Footnote_2853" class="fnanchor">[2853]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Safeguards
against
poison.</div>

<p>The fourth chapter is concerned with safeguards against
poison, which often take the form of amulets and charms
and are, if anything, even closer akin to magic than the poisons
themselves. There are the horns of a serpent which
sweat at the advent of certain poisons but not of others.
There is the gem that ceases to gleam in the presence of poison.
There is the stone which Alexander wore in his belt
until a jealous snake stole it while he was bathing in the
Euphrates. There is the following image recommended in
the book of the Persian kings&mdash;possibly the <i>Kiranides</i>. Engrave
the gem Ematites with a kneeling man girded by a
serpent whose head he holds in his right hand and tail in the
left.<a id="FNanchor_2854" href="#Footnote_2854" class="fnanchor">[2854]</a> Set this stone in a gold ring and under the gem place
a dried root of <i>serpentaria</i>. Either Peter or the author of
the book of the Persian kings affirms that he wears such a
ring and has been preserved from poisoning by it. An
emerald is another good safeguard against poison. Peter
perhaps has a confused recollection of a story told by Albertus
Magnus<a id="FNanchor_2855" href="#Footnote_2855" class="fnanchor">[2855]</a> when he adds that it has been proved that
a toad’s eyes will crack if it gazes at an emerald. There are
seven herbs, namely: Ipericon, “which Achilles is said to have
found in the Trojan army by the oracle of Apollo,” Vincetoxicum,
Enula, Rafanus, Diptamus, Aristologia, and Lactucella,
which will cure any poison. This virtue is not due
to the elements composing them but to the force of the seven
planets. Peter’s antidotes are not all occult or talismanic.
He also prescribes the more commonplace methods of a drink
of butter and hot water to provoke vomiting, the use of a
syringe to clear the intestines, the application of a relay of
hot fowls to the wound, or the sucking of it “by the mouth of
some slave or servant”&mdash;<i>sclavi vel servi</i>, an interesting bit of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_909">[Pg 909]</span>
etymological evidence of the medieval transition from the
Latin <i>servus</i> to the modern word “slave,” and for the derivation
of the latter from the Slavs who were sold in southern
and western Europe. Peter also mentions the famous <i>terra
sigillata</i> which, he says, causes vomiting if there is any
poison in the stomach. Kings and princes in the west<a id="FNanchor_2856" href="#Footnote_2856" class="fnanchor">[2856]</a> take
it with their meals as a safeguard, and it is called <i>terra sigillata</i>
because stamped with the king’s seal. Now, however,
the seals are no longer trustworthy and Peter cautions the
pope against what may be offered him as <i>terra sigillata</i>.<a id="FNanchor_2857" href="#Footnote_2857" class="fnanchor">[2857]</a>
Over seventy brief chapters are next devoted to enumeration
of the effects produced by as many poisons and how to remedy
them. The poisons include the blood of a rubicund,
choleric man, the bite of a fasting man, the gall of a leopard,
and the salamander. Among the remedies are duck’s fat and
pulverized mouse dung. The remedies operate against the
poison either by “breaking its sharpness,” or “resolving its
substance,” or “expelling it,” or “corrupting it and utterly
taking away its virtue.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
bezoar.</div>

<p>Finally Peter comes to the discussion of “bezoartic virtues”
which free from death by occult and divine virtue rather
than by their natural composition. Under this head he
proposes to deal with two difficult questions: first, whether
theriac is a bezoar (i. e., antidote or panacea) and medicine
for every poison; second, whether there is any poison which
can be set to act at a given time, so that the victim will die
from it then and not before. In those copies of the <i>De
venenis</i> which I have seen the discussion of this second question
is never reached. Perhaps it was intended only for the
pope’s ear and not published. As for the former question,
some believe in a bezoar or stone that frees from all poisons
without medical assistance. Edward I of England, when
wounded by the Sultan’s poisoned sword, is said to have been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_910">[Pg 910]</span>
cured by such a stone which “the general preceptor of the
Temple gave him, and I have seen one like it.” It is red,
purulent, light as a sponge, and fragile as gypsum. But Peter
inclines to believe that each poison has its own antidote which
is the best cure for it. Like Galen, however, he extols that
“divine and noble” artificial compound, theriac, a mixture of
all the single medicines which break or dissolve or expel
poisons. It may, he thinks, deservedly be called <i>Bezoar</i>, since
it is good against all poisons, although for any particular
poison there may be a superior particular remedy. After
Peter’s treatise has apparently ended with the words, <i>Deo
gratias</i>, there is added a note from the Pandects concerning
the stone <i>Begaar</i> or Bezoar, asserting its reality and
superiority to any simple antidote or any of the compound
theriacs.<a id="FNanchor_2858" href="#Footnote_2858" class="fnanchor">[2858]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Physiognomy.</div>

<p>Peter’s treatise on physiognomy mentions Philemon,
Aristotle, Palemon, and Loxius as the founders of the art,
and Rasis, Zacharias, and Avicenna as Arabian authorities.
Peter proposes to combine their separate contributions to
the subject “into one lucid and perfect doctrine.” The first
draft intended for the captain-general of Mantua has got into
“the hands of some rascal who scorns to communicate it to
me or others.” At the sollicitation of his friends and lest
invidious detractors envying another’s work gain glory from
it, Peter has written another draft which he flatters himself
is longer and better. “So praise be,” he piously ejaculates,
“to God, the better producer of everything, who from that
evil has created this good and best!” Peter’s treatise differs
from other Physiognomies mainly in its emphasis upon astrology,
to which its third book is largely devoted. He gives
the influence of each sign and planet upon the physique and
character of the person born under it, and discusses in considerable
detail the process of generation, the influence of
heredity as well as of the stars, and the effect upon the babe
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_911">[Pg 911]</span>
of any strong imagination, especially on the part of the
mother, during the period of generation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Astrology
in his
other
works.</div>

<p>Peter’s penchant for astrology is further evidenced by
his Latin version of the various astrological treatises of
Abraham Aben Ezra, and his translation of the brief treatise
attributed to Hippocrates on the prognostication of diseases
according to the moon. Peter or some previous translator
or editor opens it by saying that while reading the works
of Hippocrates he found this book, “small but of great utility
and very essential to all physicians. Whoever is well acquainted
with it can pronounce health, death, or life in every
infirmity.” Peter brings in astrology even in his commentary
on the Problems of Aristotle. When Aristotle mentions
an astronomer or astrologer in a derogatory manner
in the same breath with a juggler or mime or pipe-player or
rhetorician, Peter is at pains to explain that in Aristotle’s
time the science of judicial astrology had not yet attained its
present perfection.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Attitude
to
“magic.”</div>

<p>In those of his works which are certainly genuine Peter
seldom uses the word “magic” and never, I think, speaks
of it approvingly, although Michael Savonarola could see no
reason why he should not do so. Despite his reputation for
magic, the longest discussion of such arts in his admittedly
genuine works occurs in the <i>Lucidator</i>,<a id="FNanchor_2859" href="#Footnote_2859" class="fnanchor">[2859]</a> where, after the
manner of Michael Scot and Albert in the <i>Speculum astronomiae</i>,
he is chiefly concerned to distinguish astrology favorably
from these other forms of divination and magic. With
occasionally some additional detail he mainly repeats the old
account of the origin of magic with Zoroaster or Cham, the
son of Noah, and with Hermes or Enoch or Mercurius; and
the old classification of the occult arts found in Isidore and
Hugo of St. Victor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Magic
books
ascribed
to him.</div>

<p>Naudé states, on the authority of Castellan, that when
Peter was burned in effigy after his death, the reading was
forbidden of three superstitious and abominable books which
he had composed, entitled respectively, <i>Heptameron</i>, <i>Elucidarium
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_912">[Pg 912]</span>
Necromanticum</i>, and <i>Liber experimentorum mirabilium
de annulis secundum 28 mansiones lunae</i> (Book of
marvelous experiments with rings according to the twenty-eight
mansions of the moon).<a id="FNanchor_2860" href="#Footnote_2860" class="fnanchor">[2860]</a> Naudé adds, however, that
Trithemius and Symphorien Champier could find no books
on magic by Peter of Abano.<a id="FNanchor_2861" href="#Footnote_2861" class="fnanchor">[2861]</a> Such treatises, however, exist
both in print and in manuscripts, which last are mainly
of late date, and will be found listed in Appendix II. Prophecies
ascribed to “the most reverend nigromancer, Peter of
Abano,” were printed in Bologna in Italian about 1495 and
occur also in Latin in a Vatican manuscript. The printed
<i>Heptameron</i> or <i>Elements of Magic</i> consists entirely of
specific directions how to invoke demons, and if genuine,
might account for Champier’s charge that Peter borrowed
from Picatrix. The reader is instructed in the construction
of the magic circle, in the names of the angels, and concerning
benedictions, fumigations, exorcisms, prayers to God,
visions, apparitions, and conjurations for each day of the
week. The work seems quite certainly spurious.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Geomancy.</div>

<p>It is more probable that Peter may have written a geomancy
in view of his devotion to astrology and Naudé’s
statement that he had left treatises in “physiognomy, geomancy,
and chiromancy.” At any rate a geomancy exists
under his name in several printed editions and manuscripts.
In the <i>Conciliator</i> he asserted that the future and what was
absent could be predicted by means of characters “as geomancy
teaches.”<a id="FNanchor_2862" href="#Footnote_2862" class="fnanchor">[2862]</a> In the <i>Lucidator</i> he concisely described the
method of geomancy, and admitted that its figures were produced
under the influence of the constellations and that not
infrequently its judgments were verified, but he regarded it
as a very difficult science of prediction and one requiring long
experience and practice, although many persons tried their
hand at it because it looked easy.<a id="FNanchor_2863" href="#Footnote_2863" class="fnanchor">[2863]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Conclusion.</div>

<p>Such was the attitude of the learned and influential
Peter of Abano at the close of the thirteenth and opening of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_913">[Pg 913]</span>
the fourteenth century toward the subjects which we are investigating.
We may well agree with Tomasini that he combined
medicine and philosophy, astrology and natural magic,
in the closest union. He amassed a great deal of the lore of
the past, Greek, Arabic, and the writings of his Latin predecessors.
Indeed, when he repeats what earlier Latin
writers in the thirteenth century had said, just as they had
repeated what the Arabs said, we rather begin to weary of
the subjects under discussion and to feel that medieval Latin
learning is growing stagnant or stereotyped. Pico della
Mirandola spoke of Peter not only as “a man fitted by nature
to collect rather than to digest,” but also as one “whom
alas the less learned are wont to admire most when he lies
most.” In other words, Peter’s failings continued general
for some time. The Latin epitaph which Tomasini in the
seventeenth century drew up to accompany the portrait of
Peter in his book on illustrious men, although containing
one or two erroneous statements which we have already corrected,
sums up rather well the salient points of both Peter’s
learning and occult science. It may be translated thus:</p>

<p>“From a rural locality, of auspicious cognomen, a man
most illustrious in genius, doctrine, and merits, in a rude and
unhappy age became the most fortunate and learned physician.
Now too he shines with rays eternal, investigator of
all natural forces. He gave the secrets of the Greek tongue
to the Latin idiom by his power of assiduous practice and
constant reading. Employing the virtues of herbs and
stones, the sure aspects of the sky, stated hours and moments,
by the crowd he was reputed to fascinate men. He opened
the arcana of the art medical; he reconciled conflicts, a wonderful
warrior! The name of Conciliator he won by uniting
medicine and philosophy, astrology and natural magic, in the
closest bond. Born for study, he died studying. A. D. 1316,
aged 66.”<a id="FNanchor_2864" href="#Footnote_2864" class="fnanchor">[2864]</a></p>

such a fee, and for the better reason
that the chronicler Filippo
Villani tells the same tale of a
Florentine physician. A prefatory
note to the 1555 edition of
the <i>De venenis</i> states that when
Peter taught at Bologna&mdash;which
he probably did not do&mdash;he would
not visit a patient outside of that

so great was his reputation. Honorius
IV therefore at first promised

that Peter cites Averroes for
the association of seven spirits

</div>

<p class="h3sub">PREVIOUS ACCOUNTS OF PETER OF ABANO</p>

<div class="sidenote">Original
sources.</div>

<p>As is usually the case with past authors and scholars,
Peter of Abano’s own works<a id="FNanchor_2865" href="#Footnote_2865" class="fnanchor">[2865]</a> are the best source concerning
the events of his life as well as his learning and superstition.
Another important document is his will, published by Verci,
whose <i>History of the Trevisan Mark</i> includes some other
documents bearing upon Peter’s career.<a id="FNanchor_2866" href="#Footnote_2866" class="fnanchor">[2866]</a> Other contemporary
source-material connected with Peter or members of his
family has been noted by Gloria in his collection of material
concerning the University of Padua,<a id="FNanchor_2867" href="#Footnote_2867" class="fnanchor">[2867]</a> or by even more recent
investigators. Less valuable are the inscriptions, chiefly
sepulchral or eulogistic, which older writers reported but
whose dates are late or uncertain. In a MS of the fifteenth
century<a id="FNanchor_2868" href="#Footnote_2868" class="fnanchor">[2868]</a> a page between two of Peter’s treatises is devoted
to a “Catalogue of writings which Peter of Abano partly
composed himself, partly translated from the Greek.” The
list has not, I think, been noted by previous writers on Peter
of Abano, but adds little to our knowledge of his compositions.
What the sources for Peter’s life are, however,
appears in more detail in the appendices which follow and in
the notes to the text.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Michael
Savonarola.</div>

<p>What we have to consider further at present are the
previous secondary accounts of Peter which may be reckoned
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_915">[Pg 915]</span>
as of some importance. The first occurs in the work on great
citizens of Padua composed about the middle of the fifteenth
century<a id="FNanchor_2869" href="#Footnote_2869" class="fnanchor">[2869]</a> by Michael Savonarola, the noted physician and
medical writer and grandfather of the Florentine reformer,
Girolamo Savonarola. Michael at least appreciated Peter’s
learning and shared in many respects his point of view, and,
while he makes some assertions which we must regard as
extremely exaggerated, if not entirely legendary, seems to
have had access to documents which we no longer possess as
well as to local tradition. He states that he treasures in his
possession the original manuscript of the <i>Conciliator</i> in
Peter’s own handwriting; and he mentions having read with
great pleasure an abundance of letters by which the people
of Padua had recalled Peter from Paris to their midst.
Savonarola’s account, however, is brief.<a id="FNanchor_2870" href="#Footnote_2870" class="fnanchor">[2870]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Secondary
accounts
since 1500.</div>

<p>Scardeone, who wrote in the sixteenth century <i>On the
Antiquity of the City of Padua</i>,<a id="FNanchor_2871" href="#Footnote_2871" class="fnanchor">[2871]</a> can scarcely be regarded
as so good an authority as Savonarola, but he makes new
assertions concerning Peter’s life and his account has been
much followed by modern writers. In the early seventeenth
century Naudé included Peter in his defense of great men
who had been charged with magic,<a id="FNanchor_2872" href="#Footnote_2872" class="fnanchor">[2872]</a> but incorrectly gave the
date of his death as 1305, while Tomasini gave 1316 as the
date and included a portrait of Peter in his <i>Eulogies of Illustrious
Men adorned with pictures</i>.<a id="FNanchor_2873" href="#Footnote_2873" class="fnanchor">[2873]</a> I have not seen the account
of Peter in Duchastel’s <i>Lives of Illustrious Physicians</i>,<a id="FNanchor_2874" href="#Footnote_2874" class="fnanchor">[2874]</a>
published at Antwerp in 1618, nor Goulin’s <i>A Historical
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_916">[Pg 916]</span>
and Critical Notice on the Life of Abano</i>,<a id="FNanchor_2875" href="#Footnote_2875" class="fnanchor">[2875]</a> printed in
1715; but have used an article with a similar title which
Count Gian-Maria Mazzuchelli<a id="FNanchor_2876" href="#Footnote_2876" class="fnanchor">[2876]</a> published in 1741 and
which included a bibliography of Peter’s works. Tiraboschi,
in his <i>History of Italian Literature</i>,<a id="FNanchor_2877" href="#Footnote_2877" class="fnanchor">[2877]</a> corrected and supplemented
Mazzuchelli on a number of points and in general
displayed a sounder judgment than previous writers, although
he still retained some of their errors. A further
step in the study of Peter of Abano was taken by Colle who
published a monograph concerning him in 1823,<a id="FNanchor_2878" href="#Footnote_2878" class="fnanchor">[2878]</a> which he
reprinted in 1825 with some variations in his <i>Scientific and
Literary History of the University of Padua</i>.<a id="FNanchor_2879" href="#Footnote_2879" class="fnanchor">[2879]</a> A monograph
by Ronzoni in 1878<a id="FNanchor_2880" href="#Footnote_2880" class="fnanchor">[2880]</a> does not seem to have made any
new contributions, but in 1884 Gloria adduced new source-material
in his <i>Monuments of the University of Padua</i>,<a id="FNanchor_2881" href="#Footnote_2881" class="fnanchor">[2881]</a> and
pointed out errors in Colle’s account. Sante Ferrari discussed
Peter’s contributions to biology in a pamphlet published
in 1900,<a id="FNanchor_2882" href="#Footnote_2882" class="fnanchor">[2882]</a> when it was stated that he would soon issue
a volume upon Peter, which has been supplemented in 1918
by a further study. Meanwhile in 1912 B. Nardi discussed
“The theory of the soul and the generation of forms according
to Peter of Abano,”<a id="FNanchor_2883" href="#Footnote_2883" class="fnanchor">[2883]</a> and in 1916 Antonio Favaro wrote
on “Pietro d’Abano ed suo ‘Lucidator astrologiae’.”<a id="FNanchor_2884" href="#Footnote_2884" class="fnanchor">[2884]</a></p>

<p class="h3sub">A BIBLIOGRAPHY OF PETER OF ABANO’S WRITINGS</p>

<div class="sidenote">Arrangement.</div>

<p>The following order will be observed in this list of
Peter’s works. First those to which an exact or probable
date can be assigned will be taken up in chronological order.
Next will be listed those which are undated but undoubtedly
genuine. Last will be mentioned those of dubious or spurious
authorship. As Peter’s translations of the astrological
treatises of Abraham Aben Ezra are closely connected with
those of Henry Bate, and as Abraham and Bate are names of
considerable importance in the history of astrological literature,
a separate appendix following this one will be devoted
to them and Peter’s relations to their work. The following
lists of MSS for Peter’s various works can probably be
greatly added to, but the present bibliography is fuller than
any preceding one.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Translation
of
Abraham
Aben Ezra,
1293.</div>

<p>Aside from Latin editions of single works (such as the
<i>De nativitatibus</i>, Ratdolt, 1485, Cologne, 1537, which is not
Peter’s original Latin version anyway; and the <i>De luminaribus
et criticis diebus</i>, 1508, 1544; <i>de criticis diebus</i>, 1496,
1550) the only inclusive edition seems to be:</p>

<div class="hangingblockquote">

<p>Abrahe Avenaris Judei ... in re judiciali opera, ab excellentissimo
Philosopho Petro de Abano post accuratam castigationem
in Latinum traducta, Ex officina Petri Liechtenstein, Venetiis,

Appendix III.</p>

<p>The earliest MS that I have seen is</p>

<div class="hangingblockquote">

<p>BN 16089, 13-14th century, fols. 98r-113, “Incipit liber compilationis
physonomie a magistro petro de padua in civitate parisiensi....
Nobilitate generis urbanitatum titulis viro fulgenti domino
bardelloni mantue honorabilissimo capitaneo generali de bona
coxis petrus de padua parisius philosofie minimus alumpnorum

</div>

<p>Practically the same is</p>

<div class="hangingblockquote">

<p>BN 2598, fols. 87r-98r, “Explicit liber compilationis physonomie
per petrum de padua anno domini millesimo ducentesimo
nonagesimo quinto.”</p>
</div>

<p>Other MSS, all of the 15th century, are:</p>

<div class="hangingblockquote">

<p>BM Addit. 37079, fols. 3r-81v. Here the captain-general’s name
is spelled “Bardeloni ... de Bonaconsis” and the Explicit gives
the precise date, May 23, 1295.</p>

<p>BL Canon. Misc. 46, fols. 1-30, “Liber Physionomiae clarissimi
viri Petri de Appono Patavini ab eo in civitate Parisiensi
aeditus.”</p>

<p>CLM 637, fols. 12-66.</p>

<p>Vienna 5307, fols. 23-32.</p>
</div>

<p>The work is listed in the catalogue of the MSS of Amplonius
at Erfurt, written in 1412, “Math. 29, Egregius liber
Petri Paduani de phisionomia,” but seems to have disappeared
from that collection since then.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Problems</i>
of Alexander
of
Aphrodisias.</div>

<div class="hangingblockquote">

<p>Escorial f-I-11, 14th century (here we first have the Problems of
Aristotle, or perhaps Peter’s commentary on them “secundum
speciem compilationis” and “secundum novam translationem,”
then), fols. 31-42, “Incipiunt problemata alexandri affrodiseos
translata p. M. petrum Aponensem padue de greco in latinum.

affrodiseos translatus per petrum padubanensem padue
de greco in latinum MCCC secundo XV die decembris et sunt
omnia problemata numero 197.” On the other hand, the list of
Peter’s works contained in Canon. Misc. 46, speaks of these
Problems as having “differentiae quinquaginta.”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Translations
of
Galen.</div>

<div class="hangingblockquote">

<p>CLM 5, written in 1304 A. D., fol. 181, Galeni de optima corporis
nostri compositione et bona habitudine translatus per Petrum
medicum Paduanum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_919">[Pg 919]</span></p>

<p>S. Marco XIV, 6, written at Bologna in 1305 A. D., fols. 68-106,
contains Peter’s completion of the translation of the Therapeutic
Method, begun by Burgundio of Pisa.</p>

<p>Vienna 2294, 14th century, fols. 1-82v, De ingenio sanitatis quod
deficiebat de translatione Burgundionis (usque ad libri xiv, c. 12)
complete translatum per P. de Albano de Padua.</p>
</div>

<p>In the list of his works in Canon. Misc. 46 Peter is credited
with the translation of six of Galen’s treatises, namely:
de cholera nigra, de utilitate particularium, de optima compositione,
de tabe, liber creticorum, and a sixth title which
I did not clearly make out, “Item transtulit librum eiusdem
de re fa (or sa, perhaps sanitate) de verbo ad verbum non
sicut ille abreviatur.” This last translation was in 18 chapters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The <i>Conciliator</i>,
1303.</div>

<div class="hangingblockquote">

<p>Conciliator differentiarum philosophorum et precipue medicorum.
Printed eight times before 1500 and several times thereafter.
Most editions are to be found in the British Museum, but it does
not have the first edition of 1471, Venetiis apud Octavianum
Scotum, although it possesses the Venetian editions of 1521 and
1526, which are omitted from the bibliographies of Mazzuchelli
and Colle. I have chiefly used, at the John Crerar Library,
Chicago, the edition of 1526, and at the British Museum the
very rare second edition, Mantua, 1472. The editions of 1476,
1483, 1490, and 1496 are also found in America (CFCB).</p>

<p>Quaestiones de febribus, pp. 217-40, in a collection of various
authors on fevers printed in 1576, are simply nine Differentiae
from the Conciliator.</p>
</div>

<p>Not many MSS appear to have survived; some are:</p>

<div class="hangingblockquote">

<p>BN 6961, 1384 A. D., conciliator discordiarum medicinalium.</p>

<p>BN 6962, 15th century.</p>

<p>Library of the Dukes of Burgundy, 10871, early 16th century,
Petri de Abano, Conciliator de medicinis, “Ad melius intelligendum.”</p>

<p>Medic. 54, “Egregie questiones Petri Paduani consiliatoris,” in
the 1412 A. D. catalogue of Amplonius, seems no longer in that
collection.</p>

<p>Harleian 3747, 15th century, fol. 233, Petri de Ebano de balneis,
is probably an extract from the Conciliator.</p>

<p>Vienna 5289, 15th century, fol. 15r, Cura epidimiae, “Recipe radices
pedis corvini ... / ... adiustionem prohibitum,” ascribed to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_920">[Pg 920]</span>
Peter and immediately followed by his De venenis, is perhaps
also an extract from the Conciliator.</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>On the
astrolabe.</i></div>

<p>It appears to have been printed twice but I have not seen
either edition:</p>

<div class="hangingblockquote">

<p>Astrolabium planum in tabulis ascendens continens qualibet hora
atque minuto aequationes domorum coeli significationes imaginum

necnon horas inaequales pro quolibet climate mundi, Venice,
1488; and 1502 (Luc’ Antonio de Giunta).</p>
</div>

<p>Perhaps it is the same as the following work ascribed
to Peter in a MS at Munich which I have been unable to inspect:</p>

<div class="hangingblockquote">

<p>CLM 22048, 15th century, 176 fols., De signis celestibus eorumque
significatione et potestate, cum multis tabulis astronomicis.</p>
</div>

<p>Kroll and Skutsch, in their edition of Julius Firmicus
Maternus, II (1913), xxviii, list what appears to be another
edition of the same year, 1488, at Augsburg, and which they
say was reprinted in 1494 and often thereafter.</p>

<div class="hangingblockquote">

<p>Opus Astrolabii plani in tabulis: a Iohanne Angeli artium liberalium

arte: qua nuper veneciis: nunc Auguste vindelicorum

M. CCCC. LXXXVIII. Laus deo.</p>
</div>

<p>This edition, Kroll and Skutsch state, contained portions
of the Mathesis of Firmicus, and some notes which Peter
of Abano had added to the astrological images (Kroll et
Skutsch, II, xxxii). Whether these brief notes are Peter’s
sole connection with the Astrolabium planum, they do not
make clear.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>On the
motion of
the eighth
sphere</i>,
1310.</div>

<p>I have seen it stated somewhere that it forms a part of the
preceding work. I have read the treatise in the first of the
following MSS:</p>

<div class="hangingblockquote">

<p>Canon. Misc. 190, 1445 A. D., fols. 78r-83v, Tractatus motus
octave spere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_921">[Pg 921]</span></p>

<p>Cod. Vatic. Palat. Lat. 1377, 14-15th century, fols. 1r-5r, “Incipit
tractatus quem composuit magister Petrus Paduanus in motu
octave spere et sequitur capitulum primum prohemiale in operis
causa et ipsius intentione. Quoniam iuxta Ptholomeum rerum
quippe causas ... / ... inde causa existit prefati. Explicit
tractatus motus octave spere ordinatus a magistro Petro Paduanensi
anno gratiae 1310.”</p>

<p>Vienna 5498, 15th century, fols. 60r-70v, “Libellus in motu octave
sphere.”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">The
<i>Lucidator</i>,
1310.</div>

<p>The fuller title, “Lucidator dubitabilium astronomie,” is
used by Peter himself in citing the work in the Prohemium
to his treatise on the motion of the eighth sphere.</p>

<div class="hangingblockquote">

<p>BN 2598, following the Physonomia, fols. 99r-125v, “Quoniam
astrologyce considerationis ambiguitates....” At fol. 125v
the copyist, Petrus Collensis, whom Duhem characterizes as
“scribe aussi maladroit qu’ignorant latiniste,” adds his name and
a table of contents comprising ten questions. But the last four
of these do not seem to be discussed in the text, of which the
last three pages contain rather the beginning of the treatise on
the motion of the eighth sphere. Therefore we have only the
preface and first six Differentiae of the Lucidator. No copy
of the Lucidator was known before Duhem, Études sur Léonard
de Vinci, 1906-1909, I, 50-51, called attention to this MS.</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Commentary
on the
<i>Problems</i>
of Aristotle,
1310.</div>

<div class="hangingblockquote">

<p>Expositio in librum problematum Aristotelis, Mantua 1475; Padua,
1482, 1501, 1520. The editio princeps of 1475 is not in the British
Museum, although it has the other three editions, but copies of
it exist in America (CFCB). The 1482 edition is said to have
really been printed at Venice by Herbort. I have consulted the
edition of 1482 in this country at the Columbia University Library.
The Incipit in the 1482 edition reads, “Expositio praeclarissimi
atque eximii artium ac medicinae doctoris Petri de
Ebano Patavini in librum Problematum Aristotelis feliciter
incipit.”</p>

<p>But the Explicit is given imperfectly in this 1482 edition and may
better be repeated after a Venetian MS, S. Marco XII, 84, 14th
century, fols. 1-139, “Explicit expositio succincta compilationis
problematum Aristotelis quam Petrus edidit Padubanensis et a
nullo prius interpretante; incepta quidem Parisius et laudabiliter
Paduae terminata anno legis Christianorum millesimo trecentesimo
decimo cum laude Dei altissimi cuius nomen sit benedictum
per saecula, amen.” The Explicit as given in the first edition
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_922">[Pg 922]</span>
similarly stated that Peter composed the work partly in
Paris and finished it in Padua in 1310. The Venetian MS
just mentioned omits the text of Aristotle and gives only Peter’s
commentary.</p>

<p>BN 6540. An illuminated MS with a picture at the beginning of
a smooth-shaven man in gown and hood which is possibly meant
for Peter. This MS would presumably be the autograph, were
the MSS Catalogue right in dating it in 1310 A. D.; but I think
that the date when the Explicit states that the work was completed
has been incorrectly assumed to be the time when the
MS was written. There seems to be nothing about the MS to
indicate that it was written as early as 1310.</p>

<p>BN 6543, 14th century.</p>

<p>Arsenal 723, 15th century, 286 fols. This also begins with the
prologue of Jean de Jandun who lectured on the work at Paris
from a copy of Peter’s Commentary given him by the famous
Marsiglio of Padua.</p>

<p>Mazarine 3520, 14th century. According to the MSS Catalogue,
the prologue differs from that in the 1519 (1520?) edition, but
the text is the same except that it stops in the midst of the 28th
problem under Particula X.</p>

<p class="h3sub">PETER OF ABANO, ABRAHAM ABEN EZRA, AND HENRY BATE</p>

<div class="sidenote">French
translation
from the
Hebrew.</div>

<p>The French translation from the Hebrew of astrological
treatises by Abraham Aben Ezra is preserved in BN, fonds
de Sorbonne, 1825. I have not seen the MS but infer from
the description in HL XXI, 500-3 that it includes only five
of Abraham’s treatises, The Beginning of Wisdom, Nativities,
Revolutions, Elections, and Interrogations. At the
close of The Beginning of Wisdom we are told that it was
written down by Obers de Montdidier from the dictation
of Hagins the Jew in the house of Sire Henri Bate at
Malines and finished December 22, 1273.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Peter of
Abano’s
Latin
version.</div>

<p>One MS of Peter of Abano’s version, BN supplem. lat.
151, is partially described in HL 21, 501. Others which I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_927">[Pg 927]</span>
have examined are BN 7336, BN 7438, Canon. Misc. 190.
I have seen various other MSS noted in catalogues and
elsewhere, but such notices seldom seem to give a full and
accurate list of the treatises. They were printed in 1507
by Peter Liechtenstein as noted in Appendix II. All copies
which I have seen contain at the close of the first treatise,
the <i>Liber Introductorius</i> or Beginning of Wisdom, the passage,
of which HL 21, 501 has already quoted the Latin,
stating that when Peter of Abano the Paduan found this
work “in Gallic idiom, through the unskilfulness of the
translator from the Hebrew defective in many ways, corrupt,
and sometimes poorly arranged and failing to make
sense, as far as he could he brought it back in the Latin
tongue to Abraham’s original meaning.” The date is then
given as 1293. Peter is also usually named as the translator
at the beginning or end of the other treatises.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Additional
treatises
in Peter’s
version.</div>

<p>In the Latin versions of Abraham’s astrological treatises
besides the five named by the Histoire Littéraire are found
the <i>Liber rationum</i>,<a id="FNanchor_2885" href="#Footnote_2885" class="fnanchor">[2885]</a> the <i>Liber luminarium et de cognitione
diei cretici</i>,<a id="FNanchor_2886" href="#Footnote_2886" class="fnanchor">[2886]</a> and <i>Tractatus particulares</i>, which are really
three treatises, namely: (1) “Incipit alius tractatus particulare.
Incipit tractatus de partibus horarum in interrogationibus”;<a id="FNanchor_2887" href="#Footnote_2887" class="fnanchor">[2887]</a>
(2) “Tractatus in tredecim manieribus planetarum”;<a id="FNanchor_2888" href="#Footnote_2888" class="fnanchor">[2888]</a>
and (3) “Tractatus de significationibus planetarum
in duodecim domibus Abrahe.”<a id="FNanchor_2889" href="#Footnote_2889" class="fnanchor">[2889]</a> The <i>De consuetudinibus
in judiciis astrorum et est centiloquium Bethen</i>, which occurs
in the midst of Abraham’s treatises in the MSS, is
probably not by him and is placed last in the 1507
edition. The <i>Tractatus particulares</i> are not included by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_928">[Pg 928]</span>

writings.<a id="FNanchor_2890" href="#Footnote_2890" class="fnanchor">[2890]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">A Latin
translation
by Henry
Bate.</div>

<p>While in general the Latin translation of Abraham’s
astrological treatises is ascribed to Peter, in all the editions
and manuscripts that I have seen,<a id="FNanchor_2891" href="#Footnote_2891" class="fnanchor">[2891]</a> one of them, entitled
<i>De mundo vel seculo</i> and dealing with conjunctions and
revolutions, is ascribed to Henry Bate, the same under whose
patronage the French translations were made.<a id="FNanchor_2892" href="#Footnote_2892" class="fnanchor">[2892]</a> It would
therefore seem that Peter found Henry Bate’s own Latin
translation of 1281 more satisfactory than the French translation
made at Bate’s house in 1273,<a id="FNanchor_2893" href="#Footnote_2893" class="fnanchor">[2893]</a> and did not attempt
to revise it. In some manuscripts Bate is also credited with
a Latin translation of The Beginning of Wisdom or <i>Liber
introductorius</i>, made in 1292.<a id="FNanchor_2894" href="#Footnote_2894" class="fnanchor">[2894]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_929">[Pg 929]</span></p><div class="sidenote">Other

<p>This Henry Bate was called by Pico della Mirandola “a
disciple of Albertus Magnus.”<a id="FNanchor_2895" href="#Footnote_2895" class="fnanchor">[2895]</a> In 1274 at Malines and
in fulfilment of a promise made to William of Moerbeke,
the noted translator of the Dominican Order and at that
time papal chaplain and penitentiary, when they were together
in Lyons, Bate composed a treatise on the astrolabe.<a id="FNanchor_2896" href="#Footnote_2896" class="fnanchor">[2896]</a>
Later Bate also wrote an account of his own horoscope and
destiny.<a id="FNanchor_2897" href="#Footnote_2897" class="fnanchor">[2897]</a> It gives the year of his birth as 1244. He was a
canon, doctor of theology, and university professor; and
seems to have spent his life mainly at Malines, Liège, and
Paris. He also wrote on errors in the Alfonsine astronomical
tables.<a id="FNanchor_2898" href="#Footnote_2898" class="fnanchor">[2898]</a> Another unpublished work of his is entitled
<i>Speculum divinorum et quorundam naturalium</i>.<a id="FNanchor_2899" href="#Footnote_2899" class="fnanchor">[2899]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Other

<p>There were also Latin versions of other astronomical
and astrological works by Abraham than those translated
by Bate or Peter.<a id="FNanchor_2900" href="#Footnote_2900" class="fnanchor">[2900]</a> One cannot, however, be sure that
“Abraham Judaeus” always refers to Abraham Avenezra,
as there was a translator or translators of the thirteenth
century by that name. Simon Cordo of Genoa was assisted
in his Latin translation of the medical works of Serapion by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_930">[Pg 930]</span>
an Abraham Judaeus of Tortosa;<a id="FNanchor_2901" href="#Footnote_2901" class="fnanchor">[2901]</a> and Alfonso X of Castile
employed a Jew named Abraham in astronomical translation
from Arabic into Spanish.<a id="FNanchor_2902" href="#Footnote_2902" class="fnanchor">[2902]</a> An Abraham Iudeus of
Barcelona translated Haly on Elections from Arabic into
Latin,<a id="FNanchor_2903" href="#Footnote_2903" class="fnanchor">[2903]</a> and was perhaps the same as Abraham Bar Chasdai,
a rabbi of Barcelona who translated the supposititious Aristotelian
work <i>De pomo</i> from Arabic into Hebrew, after
which Manfred, the illegitimate son of Emperor Frederick
II, translated it or had it translated from Hebrew into Latin.</p>

<p class="h3sub">WAS PETER CALLED TO TREVISO IN 1314?</p>

<p>It was stated by Bonifazio in his <i>History of Treviso</i>,<a id="FNanchor_2904" href="#Footnote_2904" class="fnanchor">[2904]</a>
and repeated by Mazzuchelli<a id="FNanchor_2905" href="#Footnote_2905" class="fnanchor">[2905]</a> and Tiraboschi,<a id="FNanchor_2906" href="#Footnote_2906" class="fnanchor">[2906]</a> that on
August 7, 1314, the Trevisans, wishing to establish a
university, brought Peter to their city, where he taught and
practiced medicine for a year. Colle<a id="FNanchor_2907" href="#Footnote_2907" class="fnanchor">[2907]</a> agreed that he received
a call but doubted if he accepted it because his will,
drawn up in 1315, makes it appear that he is still in the
employ of Padua. But it is not quite certain that he even
received a call, if we judge from the extant original documents,<a id="FNanchor_2908" href="#Footnote_2908" class="fnanchor">[2908]</a>
a decree issued by the government of Treviso on
August 9, 1314, and letters of the 15th and 16th of that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_931">[Pg 931]</span>
month. The decree indeed aims at the institution of professorial
chairs in the two laws and medicine (<i>phisica</i>) at
Treviso, namely, Ordinary Lecturers in Civil and Canon
Law, and Extraordinary Lecturers in Civil Law and Medicine.
Under each of these four heads it lists three names,
and that of “Master Peter of Abano” heads those in medicine.
But the decree further states that “the doctors named
below” are to be balloted upon, and apparently by lot,<a id="FNanchor_2909" href="#Footnote_2909" class="fnanchor">[2909]</a> and
thus arranged in order of first, second, and third choice.
The position is then to be offered to the first one chosen;
if he refuses, to the second; and so on. It is also stated
that the incumbents “are to lecture and teach through three
years continuously after their arrival,” not for one year.
The normal salary is set at four hundred petty pounds annually,
although the Council of Three Hundred are left some
liberty in increasing or diminishing this amount. Moreover,
we have a letter of August sixteenth notifying Peter
of Suzara of his final appointment after he had indicated
that he would accept the election. Similar letters were sent
to five others of the twelve men named in the decree, and
the name of Peter of Abano is not found among the five, the
professor named in medicine being Henzelerius or Hengelerius.
Either therefore Peter of Abano had not been
elected or had refused to accept the appointment.</p>

<p class="h3sub">PETER’S SALARY AT PADUA</p>

<div class="sidenote">Amount
exaggerated.</div>

<p>The amount of salary offered at Treviso was worth
mentioning because the statement has been made over and
over again that Peter in his will of 1315 bequeathed to
the town government of Padua fifteen hundred lire or pounds
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_932">[Pg 932]</span>
that were due him for his past three months’ salary. From
this it was inferred that his annual stipend was either six
thousand pounds, or four thousand if reckoned on the basis
of an academic year of eight months. This seemed to show
that he was the highest paid professor of his own, not to
mention our, age. On turning, however, to the will as
printed by Verci<a id="FNanchor_2910" href="#Footnote_2910" class="fnanchor">[2910]</a> we discover that the fifteen hundred
pounds represent three years of back pay, and that Peter
further bequeaths to the commune of Padua five hundred
pounds of small <i>denarii</i> due on his salary, presumably for
the current year.<a id="FNanchor_2911" href="#Footnote_2911" class="fnanchor">[2911]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Why was
it so far in
arrears?</div>

<p>This puts an entirely different aspect upon the matter.
It not only shows that Peter’s stipend was scarcely a tithe
of what had been supposed, although a good salary for the
times, as a comparison with that offered at Treviso and with
the amounts of the other legacies made by Peter in his will
indicates. It also raises the question, why was the payment
of Peter’s salary some four years in arrears? And why
does Peter make a distinction between five hundred pounds
for which he holds papers (<i>Bulletas</i>) from the town officials
and the fifteen hundred pounds due him for the previous
three years and for which he apparently has nothing to show.
Is there some question as to his claim for salary for those
three years or even as to his having been in the Commune’s
employ? Probably the simplest explanation is that after
failing to receive his salary for these years Peter took the
precaution to get a definite statement concerning it for the
fourth. This might also serve to explain why Treviso had
hopes of getting him away from Padua in 1314, and why
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_933">[Pg 933]</span>
he stayed on in 1315. The years just preceding 1315 seem
to have been a troublous time for the city of Padua, which
incurred a heavy sentence from the emperor Henry VII,
and had wars with Vicenza and Can Grande, not to mention
civil strife such as that of April, 1314, when another Peter&mdash;<i>Judex
de Altichino</i>&mdash;was slain with his sons in the public
square by the people, their goods confiscated, and the family
banished to the fourth generation.<a id="FNanchor_2912" href="#Footnote_2912" class="fnanchor">[2912]</a></p>

<p>There seems to be no quarrel between Peter and the
Commune of Padua, for he goes on in his will to entrust
himself, his children, and his property to its tutelage and
defense, besides leaving the Commune the two thousand
pounds in question. Also as Peter makes his will in Padua,
where most of his legatees live, where he still has his residence,
and where he intends to be buried, it appears that in
May, 1315, he still is in the employ of that city and has been
for years past. So he has not yet gone to Treviso or elsewhere.
Nor is his bequeathing the two thousand pounds
arrears to the city a sure indication that he does not intend
to teach there any more, either because he expects to die soon,
or to accept a position in another university, or to cease
teaching entirely because of old age. These arrears are an
asset and he has to dispose of them somehow in making
his will; he evidently has continued to teach when one and
two years’ pay was owing him, and he may continue to do
so now when three or four years’ salary is in arrears. However,
it must be said that he shows no hope of ever recovering
these arrears, nor is there any evidence that he ever did.</p>

<p class="h3sub">WHEN DID PETER DIE?</p>

<p>The date of Peter’s death may be placed between May
25, 1315, when he made his will, and November 19, 1318,
when the record of a legal transaction in which his sons were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_934">[Pg 934]</span>
concerned appears to speak of him as dead.<a id="FNanchor_2913" href="#Footnote_2913" class="fnanchor">[2913]</a> It has usually
been assumed that he died in 1315 or 1316 and these dates
are given in epitaphs,<a id="FNanchor_2914" href="#Footnote_2914" class="fnanchor">[2914]</a> which, however, were composed
long afterwards and cannot be accepted as sure proof.
Peter’s making his will has been taken as a sign that he
was at death’s door and died almost immediately afterward,
but this inference does not seem necessarily to follow either
from the will proper or from the accompanying confession
of faith which he made on the day preceding. Arnald of
Villanova, it will be recalled, made his will in 1305 but
lived on until 1311. Peter concludes his confession of
faith by affirming that such has been his belief in the past,
is now, “and will be to the very end of his life.”<a id="FNanchor_2915" href="#Footnote_2915" class="fnanchor">[2915]</a> Unless
we assume that this last clause is added simply as a matter
of form or as a safeguard against the possibility of the
Inquisition’s making the charge that immediately after his
confession Peter became a heretic or relapsed into his previous
heresy&mdash;unless we make such an assumption, which
may be entirely unwarranted&mdash;the natural conclusion is that
Peter did not expect to die immediately.</p>

<p>The language of the will itself points in the same direction.
Peter, “a provident and discreet man,” contemplating
the unstable condition of human nature and noting that
“those things which have the appearance of lasting for a
long time” nevertheless “tend visibly toward their end,” has
decided to meet such perils half-way and happily anticipate
the last day of life by a will made when in full possession
of his senses and intellectual faculties.<a id="FNanchor_2916" href="#Footnote_2916" class="fnanchor">[2916]</a> No mention is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_935">[Pg 935]</span>
made of his being in ill health, unlike another will of the
same period quoted in the same volume of Verci, in which
the testator speaks of himself as “of sound mind, although
afflicted body, not wishing to depart this world intestate.”<a id="FNanchor_2917" href="#Footnote_2917" class="fnanchor">[2917]</a></p>

<p>Other indications that Peter not only did not die immediately
after making his will, but continued to teach and
write, are the fairly strong evidence and probability that the
pope to whom his treatise on poisons is addressed is John
XXII, who was not elected until August 7, 1316; and the
dubious assertion in a fifteenth century manuscript that
Peter was acting dean of Montpellier at that time. We
might also add that a prefatory note in the 1555 edition of
the <i>De venenis</i> states that he lived to be almost an octogenarian.</p>

<p class="h3sub">WAS THE DE VENENIS ADDRESSED TO POPE JOHN XXII
(1316-1334)?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Survey
of the
editions
and MSS</div>

<p>In some nine printed editions which I have examined the
pope addressed is denoted simply by the letter “N”; and
most of the MSS do not specify the pope by name, or if
they do, it is not so stated in the catalogues. Giacosa<a id="FNanchor_2918" href="#Footnote_2918" class="fnanchor">[2918]</a> says
that the treatise is dedicated in some MSS to Pope Honorius
IV, but he does not specify them, and I do not know of
any such. Where the pope is named, he is either John without
enumeration,<a id="FNanchor_2919" href="#Footnote_2919" class="fnanchor">[2919]</a> or John XXII.<a id="FNanchor_2920" href="#Footnote_2920" class="fnanchor">[2920]</a> It is perhaps worth
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_936">[Pg 936]</span>
noting that there never was any John XX, and that John
XXI is sometimes called John XX, and John XXII is called
John XXI, but that the converse is impossible. In view of
this uncertainty in the enumeration, it would also not be
surprising to find either John XXI or XXII named without
enumeration. Scardeone<a id="FNanchor_2921" href="#Footnote_2921" class="fnanchor">[2921]</a> in the sixteenth century asserted
that the <i>De venenis</i> was dedicated to John XXII, although
this conflicts with his statement that Peter died in 1315.
Mazzuchelli<a id="FNanchor_2922" href="#Footnote_2922" class="fnanchor">[2922]</a> spoke of an Italian translation in which the
pope is called Giacomo. There never was a pope so styled,
but both Honorius IV and John XXII (called John XXI
by Mazzuchelli owing to the error above noted) bore the
name Giacomo before they assumed their pontifical designations.
Another cogent reason for dismissing John XXI
(1276-1277) from consideration is that Peter at the age
of twenty-six or twenty-seven would neither have adopted
the authoritative tone that he employs in the <i>De venenis</i> in
addressing a pope who had himself, as Petrus Hispanus,
been a medical writer of note, nor have failed to advert
to that pope’s own medical works.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Inference
from a
citation of
Avenzoar.</div>

<p>In the <i>De venenis</i><a id="FNanchor_2923" href="#Footnote_2923" class="fnanchor">[2923]</a> Peter cites the Latin translation of
a treatise by Avenzoar (ʿAbd al Malik ibn Zuhr ibn ʿAbd al
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_937">[Pg 937]</span>
Malik, Abu Marwan) concerning the power of a powdered
emerald as an antidote against poison. In the printed editions
Avenzoar’s work is referred to as that translated for
Pope Boniface.<a id="FNanchor_2924" href="#Footnote_2924" class="fnanchor">[2924]</a> If we could only rely upon this as Peter’s
original wording, it would mean that he was himself addressing
some pope later than Boniface VIII (1294-1303),
and so would support the other evidence that the <i>De venenis</i>
was addressed to John XXII. But in at least one manuscript
of the <i>De venenis</i> the work of Avenzoar is said to
have been translated “for the Roman people.”<a id="FNanchor_2925" href="#Footnote_2925" class="fnanchor">[2925]</a> Moreover,
the Latin translation of Avenzoar in question is extant
and in the printed version<a id="FNanchor_2926" href="#Footnote_2926" class="fnanchor">[2926]</a> we read at the close that it
was translated at Venice, August 21, 1281, from Hebrew
into Latin by a master of medicine from Padua<a id="FNanchor_2927" href="#Footnote_2927" class="fnanchor">[2927]</a> with the
aid of a Jew named Jacob. The work would thus seem
to have been translated long before Boniface became pope.
In a Paris manuscript,<a id="FNanchor_2928" href="#Footnote_2928" class="fnanchor">[2928]</a> however, the translator gives his
name as John of Capua, a baptized Jew, of whom we know
as a translator of other works from Hebrew into Latin,<a id="FNanchor_2929" href="#Footnote_2929" class="fnanchor">[2929]</a>
and addresses his present translation to the archbishop of
Braga in Portugal,<a id="FNanchor_2930" href="#Footnote_2930" class="fnanchor">[2930]</a> whom Hartwig believed to be Martin
de Oliviera who held that office from 1292 to 1313. Now
this John of Capua also translated the work on Diets of
Maimonides, at the suggestion of William of Brescia who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_938">[Pg 938]</span>
was Pope Boniface VIII’s physician, and Hartwig believes
that he met the archbishop of Braga at Rome. But more
than this, in a Vienna manuscript the translation of Avenzoar
is addressed to Pope Boniface VIII himself.<a id="FNanchor_2931" href="#Footnote_2931" class="fnanchor">[2931]</a> Apparently
therefore there is justification for Peter of Abano’s
speaking of the work as translated for Boniface VIII. And
whether it was or not, in any case it was translated at too late
a date for Peter to have cited it in his <i>De venenis</i>, had that
treatise been addressed to Pope John XXI who died in 1277.
So if we admit that the <i>De venenis</i> was addressed to a Pope
John, it must have been addressed to John XXII who became
pope on August 7, 1316.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Popes and
poisons.</div>

<p>Returning for a moment to Boniface VIII, it may be
remarked that he was presumably the pope who, as Peter
himself states in the <i>Conciliator</i>, had protected him from
certain persecutors. That there was nothing strange in
addressing a work on poisons to a pope of that time is
shown by the fact that Ermengard Blasius (or Blasii)<a id="FNanchor_2932" href="#Footnote_2932" class="fnanchor">[2932]</a>
of Montpellier, physician of Philip the Fair of France, translated
the work of Moses Maimonides on poisons for
Clement V, the predecessor of John XXII, in 1307.<a id="FNanchor_2933" href="#Footnote_2933" class="fnanchor">[2933]</a> But
there is no evidence so far as I know to indicate that Peter
of Abano addressed his work on poisons to Clement V, although
chronologically it is possible.</p>

<p>The relations of Peter of Abano with the church and
the Inquisition and the question whether he was accused,
tried, or condemned for heresy, magic, or astrology, are
matters which have seldom been either carefully investigated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_939">[Pg 939]</span>
or correctly stated, although allusions are often made to
these points as if they were definitely settled. We shall
inquire here what real evidence there is. In the <i>Conciliator</i>,
written in 1303, occurs a germane statement by Peter himself
at the close of a chapter in which he has discussed the determination
of periods in history and the rise of new prophets
and religions by the courses of the stars, and the connection
of seven angelic intelligences with the seven planets. After
this somewhat bold indulgence in astrology Peter concludes,
“So much then has been said as can be comprehended by
reason concerning this according to the skill of the world’s
scholars, in no way derogating from divine wisdom in what
has been written but rather confirming it in all points since
it alone is truth and life. In this matter, however, some
mischief-makers, unwilling or rather unable to hear, for a
long time have freely vexed me, from whose hands at last
the said Truth has laudably snatched me and mine, with
the intervention too of an apostolic mandate.”<a id="FNanchor_2934" href="#Footnote_2934" class="fnanchor">[2934]</a> Before
1303, therefore, Peter’s astrology had aroused considerable
opposition, perhaps at Paris, which however was checked at
least for the time being by papal protection, and to which
Peter does not so far as I know allude again in his subsequent
works.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His professions
of orthodoxy.</div>

<p>In many passages of his works, however, Peter recognizes
that the Peripatetic philosophy and Christian dogma
do not agree, and, while stating the philosophical position,
gives his adhesion to the orthodox Faith.<a id="FNanchor_2935" href="#Footnote_2935" class="fnanchor">[2935]</a> In the preface
to the <i>Conciliator</i> he states that the work is divided into
three parts in honor of the Trinity. In the <i>Addition to
Mesuë</i> he argues that trust in God is of avail in the art of
medicine. Pious phralses such as <i>Si deo placet</i> and <i>Deo
gratias</i> occur with fair frequency in his works. Finally,
in his will of 1315, or rather in a statement made the day
before the will was drawn up, he makes profession of firm
faith in the Trinity, Creed, and articles of faith, and declares
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_940">[Pg 940]</span>
that he believes “in all respects just as Holy Mother
Church believes and teaches,” and that he has always so
believed and will until his last breath. “And if it should be
found that he has ever said anything contrary to the Faith,
he said it not because he believed it, but probably for purposes
of disputation.”<a id="FNanchor_2936" href="#Footnote_2936" class="fnanchor">[2936]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Does his
will show
fear of
the Inquisition?</div>

<p>There is perhaps no sufficient reason for doubting the
sincerity and spontaneity of these professions of faith, but
the question arises whether Peter did not make this confession
of faith in order to demonstrate that he was no heretic
and so secure the validity of the will which he made on the
day following. This would be a prudent step on his part
if he had any fear of future action by the Inquisition, since
the property of a heretic who was condemned to life imprisonment
or to the stake was subject to confiscation. Moreover,
the number of judgments of confiscation against deceased
persons was “relatively high.”<a id="FNanchor_2937" href="#Footnote_2937" class="fnanchor">[2937]</a> We now turn to
the will itself to inquire if there is anything in it to suggest
fear of the Inquisition on Peter’s part. The most, if not the
only, extraordinary feature of the will is the attitude shown
by Peter toward his sons. We have seen that three survived
him and were concerned in legal transactions in 1318 and
1321. There is, however, only one or at most two mentions<a id="FNanchor_2938" href="#Footnote_2938" class="fnanchor">[2938]</a>
of them in the will. After a list of legacies for various
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_941">[Pg 941]</span>
purposes and to various persons, including his nephews and
grandnieces, and the bequest of two thousand pounds of
back salary to the Commune of Padua, the will continues,
“Also he has commended himself, his sons, and his property
to the Commune and men of the city of Padua as if it were
the tutelage and infallible defense of their own sons and
property.” Then he names the executors of his will (<i>suos
fideicommissarios</i>) and as his heirs <i>Jacobum qu. domini
Marsilii de Carrara de Padua</i> and <i>Conradum qu. domini
Bonzanelli da Viguntia</i>, whom he describes as “trustworthy
men and of eminent virtue and repute.” Jacobus became
captain-general of Padua in 1318.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gloria’s
inference.</div>

<p>From these passages Gloria concludes that Peter entrusts
his body, his children, and his property to the Commune of
Padua in order to save them from the Inquisition,&mdash;his
body from being burned after his death, his property from
being confiscated; and that he names “two rich and powerful
citizens” as his heirs in order to enlist their aid and with the
secret understanding that they shall later transmit the residue
of his property, after his other legacies are paid, to his children.
It should, however, be realized that the confiscation
of the property of a heretic was absolute. “Forfeiture occurred
<i>ipso facto</i> as soon as the crime of heresy was committed,
the heretic could convey no legal title and any assignments
which he might have made were void, no matter
through how many hands the property might have passed.”<a id="FNanchor_2939" href="#Footnote_2939" class="fnanchor">[2939]</a>
Whether, therefore, Peter’s sons received their inheritance
directly or indirectly, it could be taken from them, if he were
condemned as a heretic either before or after his death.
On the other hand, there is this to be said in favor of Gloria’s
interpretation of the will. If Peter’s property were confiscated
as that of a heretic, it would naturally be confiscated
by the Commune of Padua, the same secular power to whom
he would be handed over for execution in case he were condemned
to the stake. By making a generous legacy to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_942">[Pg 942]</span>
city, by appealing to it for protection of himself and children,
and by naming leading citizens as his heirs, Peter may
have hoped to enlist public opinion on his side, to prevent
any Paduan from accusing him of heresy to the Inquisition
or supporting such a charge, or, in case the Inquisition
does condemn him and the city government of Padua does
confiscate his property, to induce the Commune at least to
provide for his children. And certainly the sentence in
which Peter entrusts himself, his children, and his goods
to the infallible defense of the Commune of Padua does not
sound as if he meant to disinherit his sons in favor of other
heirs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Did
Peter’s
sons
inherit his
property?</div>

<p>The next question is: what evidence is there to show
that the sons ever received their father’s property, if this
was his intention? Gloria holds that Peter’s sons are called
his heirs in documents recording legal transactions of 1318
and 1321, that consequently he meant them to be his real
heirs when he drew up his will in 1315, and that the nominal
heirs, true to their trust, have duly turned over the estate
after the funeral expenses and other legacies have been met.
If this last assumption is true and if Peter’s sons are in
1318 openly called his heirs, whereas in 1315 he did not dare
to call them his heirs, it would appear probable either that
there has been in the interval a trial for heresy and that Peter
has been acquitted, or that there has been no trial and is not
likely to be one. But I am not so sure that the documents
mentioned describe Peter’s sons as <i>his</i> heirs.<a id="FNanchor_2940" href="#Footnote_2940" class="fnanchor">[2940]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">If so, how?</div>

<p>If, however, they are openly called his heirs in 1318, or
if, whether called his heirs or not, they are in possession of
his property after his death, there are other possible explanations
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_943">[Pg 943]</span>
of this than that the heirs named in his will of 1315
have voluntarily turned over the estate to them. Either the
will may have been set aside for other reasons&mdash;it will be
noted that at its close Peter states, “if it is not valid by the
law of testaments, let it have force and hold by the law of
codicils or any other law by which it may the better and
more efficaciously have force and hold good.”<a id="FNanchor_2941" href="#Footnote_2941" class="fnanchor">[2941]</a> Or the will
may have been annulled by the sons, angry at being disinherited,
having themselves informed against their father as
a heretic. For note the one exception to the law that the
confiscation of the property of a heretic is absolute even at
the expense of his innocent widow and children. “Frederick
II and Innocent IV both decreed that children could
inherit their father’s property, if they denounced him for
heresy.”<a id="FNanchor_2942" href="#Footnote_2942" class="fnanchor">[2942]</a> But this sensational possibility<a id="FNanchor_2943" href="#Footnote_2943" class="fnanchor">[2943]</a> seems to be excluded
by another bit of evidence which Gloria did not note
but which supports his interpretation of the will. In 1325
Marsilius de Carrara, nephew of the Jacobus named as one
of Peter of Abano’s heirs and almost as prominent as his
uncle in the town politics, was knocked off his horse and
trodden under foot in a street fight in Padua, and was in
danger of his life, but was helped to his feet by “Benvenutus
of Abano, son of master Peter, and others of his men.”<a id="FNanchor_2944" href="#Footnote_2944" class="fnanchor">[2944]</a>
Thus whatever disposition was made of Peter’s property, his
nominal heirs and his sons seem to have remained on good
terms.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Burning
of Peter’s
bones for
heresy.</div>

<p>If Peter’s children were provided for, there is evidence
that the men of Padua were not equally successful in protecting
his corpse from the Inquisition. Thomas of Strasburg,
Prior-General of the Augustinian Friars from 1345<span class="pagenum" id="Page_944">[Pg 944]</span>
to 1357, in his <i>Commentary on the Sentences</i><a id="FNanchor_2945" href="#Footnote_2945" class="fnanchor">[2945]</a> calls Peter
a heretic, although he admits that he was a most capable
physician. Thomas affirms that Peter denied the miracles
by which Christ and the saints raised the dead, arguing that
men who were afflicted by a certain disease often fell into a
trance for three complete revolutions of the sky. And
when asked if Lazarus was not in the tomb four days, he
would say that it was only for three full days since the first
and fourth days were incomplete. Thomas does not affirm
that Peter ventured to deny the resurrection of Christ Himself,
but concludes his allusion to Peter by saying, “But in
this his iniquity he was deceived and received the reward of
his error. For I was present when in the city of Padua his
bones were burned for these and his other errors.” The
inference which has been drawn from this brief statement
is that at some time after Peter’s death his bones were disinterred
and burned. This much may perhaps be accepted as
the fact, since Thomas asserts he was an eye-witness, but
such gossipy reminiscence as this by medieval monks and
friars, especially when heretics or saints are the theme, is
notoriously unreliable, as Salimbene and the astounding yarns
in Thomas of Cantimpré’s work on bees show in the thirteenth
century. At any rate Thomas of Strasburg gives no
hint that the “other errors” of Peter of Abano were connected
with magic or astrology. Indeed Thomas displays a
considerable faith in astrology himself in other passages
of this work we have cited.<a id="FNanchor_2946" href="#Footnote_2946" class="fnanchor">[2946]</a> He asserts that the sky itself
has a real action on inferior objects except for free will.
Upon it the stars cannot act directly but they may affect it
indirectly owing to the radical union in us of sense appetite
and intellectual appetite.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The account
of
Michael
Savonarola.</div>

<p>A century later Michael Savonarola supplements with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_945">[Pg 945]</span>
further detail the general impression of trouble between
Peter and at least a certain party in the church which we
obtained from Abano’s own statement and from Thomas of
Strasburg, and suggests that Peter’s inclination toward
magic, or at least reputation for magic, led the Dominican
inquisitor to denounce him as a heretic at Paris and try to
bring him to prison and the flames. “But he was held in
so great veneration by royal majesty and the entire university
that means were not supplied the inquisitor to take
him.” Savonarola goes on to say that, when Peter learned
of this, he induced the king and university to call a council
of doctors of Holy Scripture, whom he convinced by forty-five
arguments that not he but the Dominicans were heretics.
“And after sentence had been so given,” continues Savonarola,
“if the story is to be believed, it was brought about
that the Dominicans were driven from Paris as heretics and
exiles and were unable to reside there for thirty-two years.”<a id="FNanchor_2947" href="#Footnote_2947" class="fnanchor">[2947]</a>
But of course we do not believe any such story, which is
mentioned nowhere else, and therefore Savonarola’s entire
account has to be suspiciously regarded as “a story.”</p>

<p>Savonarola proceeds to say, however, that then the case
was appealed to Rome and that by intervention of the pope
peace was at last made between Peter and the Dominicans;
and that in his testament, “which is held in great veneration
by many Paduans,” Peter left his body to be interred among
the Dominicans as a sign to God and the world how he had
kept the peace with them. As a matter of fact, however, it
is in the church of St. Anthony the Confessor belonging to
the Friars Minor or Franciscans of Padua that Peter’s will
directs he shall be buried, while two Franciscans and no
Dominicans are listed among the witnesses to his confession
of faith. Again therefore we find Savonarola’s account unreliable.
He concludes, “But the Dominican Inquisitor, full
of venom and breaking the truce to which he had sworn&mdash;an
action the more detestable in a clergyman, in the silence
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_946">[Pg 946]</span>
of the night opened the sepulcher, burned the body, and gave
the ashes to the wind. O unspeakable crime!”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Scardeone’s
account.</div>

<p>As we recede further from Peter of Abano’s own time to
Scardeone in the sixteenth century, more specific details concerning
his life accumulate. Scardeone perverts Savonarola’s
statement that Peter’s astrological predictions won him a
reputation as a magician and that this got him into trouble
with the Dominicans at Paris, into the assertion that Peter’s
devotion to mathematical disciplines at Paris caused him on
his return to Padua to be suspected of magic. He adds
that a rival physician, Peter of Reggio, jealous of Abano’s
science and fame, reported him to the Inquisition as a heretic
and necromancer. That the Inquisition twice instituted proceedings
against him: in 1306, when three illustrious men,
whom Scardeone mentions by name,<a id="FNanchor_2948" href="#Footnote_2948" class="fnanchor">[2948]</a> were his patrons and,
since nothing was proved against him at the trial, he was
freed from this calumny; and again in 1315, when he died
during the trial&mdash;Scardeone, however, says nothing to suggest
that this was due to application of torture&mdash;and was
buried in the church of St. Anthony. The Inquisition, however,
went on to condemn him upon the basis of his writings,
but meanwhile either his friends or his housekeeper Marietta
had removed and hidden his body, which the inquisitors had
to be content to burn in effigy. “This,” coolly continues
Scardeone, “is why Thomas of Strasburg wrote that he saw
the bones of Peter of Abano burned in the square of Padua.”
Thus Scardeone not merely makes new assertions based upon
no one knows what, but contradicts statements of Savonarola
who was nearer to the events and Thomas of Strasburg who
claims to be an eye-witness. It is on Scardeone’s account,
nevertheless, that most modern allusions to Peter of Abano
and his fate are based.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Naudé’s
statement.</div>

<p>It is hardly worth while to pursue the matter further in
later writers except perhaps to note an inscription upon a
statue of Peter of Abano in Padua which Naudé mentions
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_947">[Pg 947]</span>
in 1625.<a id="FNanchor_2949" href="#Footnote_2949" class="fnanchor">[2949]</a> “Petrus Aponus of Padua, most learned in
philosophy and medicine, and on that account winner of the
name of Conciliator; in astrology indeed so skilled that he
incurred suspicion of magic, and, falsely accused of heresy,
was acquitted.” Thus only one trial is mentioned and that
resulting in an acquittal.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_2938" href="#FNanchor_2938" class="label">[2938]</a> The doubtful passage is, “<i>Item

<p>The question is, does Peter
leave Maria one hundred petty
pounds outright and an annuity
of twenty-five pounds “for her
labor in managing the house and
her children as long as she lives,”
or “for (i.e., in return for) her

his children as long as she lives”?</p>

<p>The words “<i>dum vixerit</i>” must
mean “as long as she lives,” because
they are similarly used in
the next sentence of another recipient

mean, “while he (i.e., Peter)
lived,” there would be less difficulty
in translating “<i>pueros suos</i>”
as “his children.”</p>

<p>Later legend (Scardeone, 1560,

housekeeper named Marietta who
saved his corpse from the Inquisition
by hiding it for a time. It
is also possible that Maria was
Peter’s mistress as well as housekeeper,

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Reasons
for his
celebrity.</div>

<p>The name of Cecco d’Ascoli has perhaps received more attention
and is better known than the writings and actual
achievements of its owner deserve. If so, this is mainly for
two reasons; first, that his poem <i>l’Acerba</i> has been associated
with the study of Dante; second, that he was condemned
by the Inquisition and burned at the stake in Florence in
1327. Doubtless Cecco should receive some attention in
the histories both of literature and science as one who was
both an Italian poet and a Latin teacher and writer of
astronomy and astrology. But his works and personality
would perhaps have been long since forgotten but for the
fact that his learned poem, <i>l’Acerba</i>, was taken to be an
invidious parody of Dante’s <i>Divine Comedy</i>, and that both
it and his astrological work in Latin were ordered to be
burned at the same time with himself, while all persons retaining
copies of them were to be excommunicated. Recently,
it is true, it has been held that Cecco imitated Dante
out of admiration for him and not from any desire to cast
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_949">[Pg 949]</span>
aspersion upon the <i>Divine Comedy</i>,<a id="FNanchor_2950" href="#Footnote_2950" class="fnanchor">[2950]</a> but in any case their
names have long been coupled. As for the condemnation
by the Inquisition, its chief effect seems to have been to raise
a rather ordinary astrologer to the position of a martyr for
science and a reproach to the medieval church. Many apologies
for and eulogies of Cecco have been penned through
the centuries since, while a few writers have tried to justify
the action of the Inquisition, to discredit Cecco, and to question
his scientific reputation.<a id="FNanchor_2951" href="#Footnote_2951" class="fnanchor">[2951]</a> Certainly the condemnation
by the Inquisition seems to have advertised rather than repressed
his writings, since not only has the poem <i>l’Acerba</i>
survived but also two works on astrology. Of these three
the two that the Inquisition probably meant to forbid were
both in print before 1500 and the Protestant Revolt. The
third, which the Inquisitors seem to have overlooked, was
also neglected by publishers until the present century.</p>

<p>Hitherto in our survey of medieval learning, more particularly
of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, we have
found little or no evidence in support of the old view, or
rather assumption, that every medieval scientist was persecuted
by the church. Signs of a theological party hostile to
the growing interest in natural science we have seen, but
much more evidence of this growing interest itself, and that
too among bishops, friars, Franciscan as well as Dominican,
and even popes. We have seen that the scientific attitude
of William of Conches prevailed in the long run, that it is
very doubtful if Roger Bacon was in any sense persecuted
by the church for devotion to natural science, and that Peter
of Abano did not have to die in order to escape the Inquisition
but that it had to wait until after his death before it
could do him any harm. But now in Cecco d’Ascoli we
come at last, and it is not until the fourteenth century, to a
well authenticated case of an astrologer of some learning
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_950">[Pg 950]</span>
being put to death through the agency of the Inquisition.
This makes his writings the more important for us to note,
although we do not find their contents such as to entitle him
to any high rank as a natural scientist.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Works by
Cecco to
be considered
here.</div>

<p>It is hard to see any reason for the condemnation of
<i>l’Acerba</i> by the Inquisition except that it was written by
Cecco. Its superstition is so slight as not to call for notice
here, nor is its natural science more remarkable than that
of other vernacular poems such as the <i>Romance of the Rose</i>.
Our discussion will center about his two extant Latin works
which are in the form of commentaries upon the <i>Sphere</i> of
Sacrobosco<a id="FNanchor_2952" href="#Footnote_2952" class="fnanchor">[2952]</a> and the <i>Principia</i> of Alcabitius.<a id="FNanchor_2953" href="#Footnote_2953" class="fnanchor">[2953]</a> Both seem
to be in the form of class-room lectures and were presumably
delivered by Cecco at Bologna. As we shall see, it is
reasonably certain that the Latin work condemned by the
Inquisition was the commentary on the Sphere and not that
on Alcabitius, although why the latter should be overlooked
when the innocuous <i>l’Acerba</i> was condemned is difficult
to explain except by the usual ignorance and stupidity
of censors and persecutors. It is unlikely that either of the
Latin works has been altered from Cecco’s original either
by himself or others in order to render it less objectionable
from the theological point of view, after the Inquisition had
condemned his book on astrology <i>in toto</i>. It would be more
likely if anything to be touched up in the other direction.
In any case these two works are what we have from Cecco’s
pen to show what were the views of an astrologer condemned
by the Inquisition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_951">[Pg 951]</span></p><div class="sidenote">Other
sources.</div>

<p>We have, it is true, some documentary evidence other
than Cecco’s own works to show what his views were and
why he was condemned by the Inquisition, but it is not very
satisfactory. Boffito, who in recent times has made the
most specialized study of Cecco d’Ascoli and his works,
editing the commentary on Alcabitius hitherto unprinted
and investigating the problem, “Why was the astrologer
Cecco d’Ascoli condemned to be burned?”<a id="FNanchor_2954" href="#Footnote_2954" class="fnanchor">[2954]</a> accepts outside
of Cecco’s own writings only two sources as at all original
and reliable, namely, the account in Giovanni Villani’s contemporary
chronicle<a id="FNanchor_2955" href="#Footnote_2955" class="fnanchor">[2955]</a> and a Latin manuscript in the Riccardian
library at Florence<a id="FNanchor_2956" href="#Footnote_2956" class="fnanchor">[2956]</a> which contains a summary of
the inquisitorial sentence against Cecco. This manuscript
is on paper and I should say is certainly not earlier than the
fifteenth century. Boffito views with suspicion the longer
sentence in Italian which was reproduced by Cantù<a id="FNanchor_2957" href="#Footnote_2957" class="fnanchor">[2957]</a> and
made use of in Lea’s <i>History of the Inquisition</i>,<a id="FNanchor_2958" href="#Footnote_2958" class="fnanchor">[2958]</a> since it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_952">[Pg 952]</span>
is not found earlier than in a manuscript of the seventeenth
century.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The sentence
by
the Inquisition.</div>

<p>According to the Riccardian manuscript Cecco’s astrology
was the reason, or at least the pretext, for his condemnation,
but it does not make clear just what was found
objectionable in his astrological teaching. It brings out
further, however, that he was not put to death for a first
offense but was burned at Florence as a relapsed heretic on
the ground that he had violated the terms of a previous
sentence imposed upon him by the inquisitor at Bologna.
In 1324 the Bolognese inquisitor had found Cecco guilty of
improper utterances concerning the Catholic Faith and had
imposed upon him a penance of fifteen days of confession,
daily recital of thirty Paternosters and as many Ave Marias,
occasional fasting for a year, and the hearing every Sabbath
of a sermon by the friars. He furthermore took from
Cecco “all his astrological books, great and small,” forbade
him ever again to teach astrology at Bologna or elsewhere,
publicly or privately, deprived him indefinitely of his professorial
chair and doctor’s degree, and fined him seventy
pounds Bolognese. Taken altogether, this sentence, while
it did not condemn Cecco to death, would seem to have deprived
him rather effectually of future means of livelihood.
Three years later the inquisitor at Florence received the account
of the foregoing process against Cecco at Bologna,
summoned him before himself, pronounced him a heretic,
and handed him over to the secular arm to be burned at the
stake. This part of the sentence was duly executed by the
ducal <i>Vicarius</i>, Lord Jacob of Brescia. It was further decreed
that Cecco’s astrological book in Latin and his poem
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_953">[Pg 953]</span>
<i>l’Acerba</i> in Italian should be burned and that all persons
retaining copies of them should be excommunicated.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Villani’s
account.</div>

<p>Villani adds a number of further details. He states that
it was the <i>Commentary on the Sphere</i> which had caused
Cecco’s condemnation at Bologna, that he had been forbidden
to make further use of it, and that at Florence it was charged
that he had violated this prohibition. But Cecco denied this
and attributed his arrest at Florence to the hostility of a
Friar Minor who was both bishop of Aversa and chancellor
to Charles of Calabria, who was at that time duke of Florence
and whose astrologer Cecco seems to have become after
leaving Bologna. In this new position, Villani says, Cecco
had made many true predictions of political events, but although
a great astrologer he was a vain man and of worldly
life. The friar-bishop-chancellor regarded Cecco’s presence
at Florence as court astrologer as an abomination. Villani,
however, like Cecco himself, does not appear to regard his
practicing astrology at Florence as necessarily a violation of
the decree of the inquisitor at Bologna; but if the Riccardian
manuscript correctly reproduces the Bologna sentence, Cecco
would certainly seem to have violated it. Villani volunteers
more information than the Riccardian manuscript as to the
respects in which Cecco’s teaching or practice of astrology
was found objectionable. He makes the general assertion,
which is too vague to be of much value, that Cecco was too
bold in exercising his science in things prohibited and untrue,
“since the influence of the stars does not constrain of
necessity” nor against human free will and divine prescience.
Villani, indeed, perhaps added this qualification, after having
stated that Cecco made many true political predictions, in
order to save himself from possible censure. But he more
specifically states that Cecco ascribed the force of necessity
to the stars; that in his treatise on the <i>Sphere</i> he asserted
that there were evil spirits generated in the sky who could
be coerced by incantations under certain constellations to
perform many marvels; and that he taught that Christ came
to earth in accordance with the will of God and with the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_954">[Pg 954]</span>
principles of astrology, and ought from his nativity to live
with His disciples <i>come poltrone</i> and to die the death that
He did, while Antichrist would come according to the courses
of the planets in rich raiment and power. Cecco also, Villani
vaguely adds, taught “many other idle things and contrary
to the Faith.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The later
manuscripts.</div>

<p>The later manuscripts incorporate these charges of
Villani in the inquisitorial sentence against Cecco, using suspiciously
similar wording in the passage concerning Christ
and Antichrist, and charging that Cecco has taught his work
on the <i>Sphere</i> in the schools contrary to his promise and
oath. These manuscripts further assert that Cecco has confessed
to teaching publicly that men born under certain constellations
must necessarily be rich or poor or decapitated,
that God would not change the course of nature, and that
in the fourth and eighth sections<a id="FNanchor_2959" href="#Footnote_2959" class="fnanchor">[2959]</a> of his <i>Commentary on
the Sphere</i> he said that under certain constellations happy
divine men would be born like Moses, Hermes, Merlin, and
Simon Magus. Like Villani the later manuscripts mention
Cecco’s political predictions at Florence and state that he had
prophesied concerning “the Bavarian.”<a id="FNanchor_2960" href="#Footnote_2960" class="fnanchor">[2960]</a> They also mention
the stress laid by Cecco upon the importance of the
constellations that cities are founded under. Such of the
statements of these late manuscripts<a id="FNanchor_2961" href="#Footnote_2961" class="fnanchor">[2961]</a> concerning Cecco’s
astrological teachings as are not found in Villani will be
found to rest upon certain passages in his own works or upon
a misapprehension of them.<a id="FNanchor_2962" href="#Footnote_2962" class="fnanchor">[2962]</a> They also mention his <i>Commentary
on Alcabitius</i>, whereas the older form of the sentence
condemns only one Latin book on astrology by him.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_955">[Pg 955]</span>
Another suspicious circumstance about the longer form of
inquisitorial sentence preserved in these late manuscripts is
that the Inquisition is represented as itself condemning
Cecco to death<a id="FNanchor_2963" href="#Footnote_2963" class="fnanchor">[2963]</a> instead of handing him over to the secular
arm.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Astrology
for
cities.</div>

<p>Let us next turn to Cecco’s two commentaries in Latin
and see what foundation there is in them for the astrological
teachings ascribed to him by Villani and the longer form
of inquisitorial sentence preserved only in very late and suspiciously
worded manuscripts. It is true that Cecco emphasizes
the control exercised by the stars over the fate of cities.
The laying of the first stone of a city is a moment as influential
over all its future history as is the date of conception
in the case of an individual. Romans and Tuscans are so
corrupt because of the ascendancy of Venus over them, the
Lombards are scientific through the influence of Mercury.<a id="FNanchor_2964" href="#Footnote_2964" class="fnanchor">[2964]</a>
If cities are to endure, they should be built under the fixed
signs.<a id="FNanchor_2965" href="#Footnote_2965" class="fnanchor">[2965]</a> It is best for a man to live in a city with the same
guiding star as his own planet.<a id="FNanchor_2966" href="#Footnote_2966" class="fnanchor">[2966]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The fate
of individuals.</div>

<p>In the notes which I took on the astrological statements
in Cecco’s commentaries there seems to be no single direct
assertion that under certain constellations men <i>must necessarily</i>
be rich or poor or decapitated. Cecco does tell his
students, however, “You ought to know another thing, that
when Jupiter is in the signs of Mars, forsooth Aries or
Scorpion, the person born will be bound with the girdle of
poverty, infamous, and injured by the powerful.”<a id="FNanchor_2967" href="#Footnote_2967" class="fnanchor">[2967]</a> The word
“decapitated” perhaps is reminiscent of an anecdote which
Cecco tells in discussing the fulfilment of dreams and their
dependence on the constellations. A certain malefactor went
to a meadow with his associates with a scythe to cut down
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_956">[Pg 956]</span>
grass and saw beetles rolling up dung in the road. This
reminded him of a dream which he had had the night before
that these beetles would decapitate him, and he started in
to kill them. But as he struck at them with the handle of
the scythe, the blade which was over his own neck cut off
his head. “And the moon was in Taurus in conjunction
with the fixed star which is called Aldebaran; such is the
story told me by my master whom may God pardon.”<a id="FNanchor_2968" href="#Footnote_2968" class="fnanchor">[2968]</a> This
conjunction, however, would seem to have been that prevailing
when the malefactor had his dream and not the constellation
under which he was born. Cecco in another passage,
however, not only cites Zael to the effect that a horoscope
when Mars is lord of the ascendant and in a favorable angle
of the sky bestows power and dignity along with impiety and
the greatest cruelty, and, unless he is regarded by some
favorable planet, will cause the possessor of the horoscope
to lose his power soon; but Cecco also adduces the recent
tyrant of Ascoli, John Venibene, as a specific example who
ruled for three years very cruelly and then was expelled and
died abroad.<a id="FNanchor_2969" href="#Footnote_2969" class="fnanchor">[2969]</a> In the case, on the other hand, of a constellation
under which are born lords of the whole earth,
such as emperors, kings, and princes, Cecco warns that the
sons born to peasants in this constellation will not become
kings but simply leaders among men of their class, “since
the intractability of the material weakens the celestial force”
and “the vices and virtues of the parents are transmitted to
their heirs.”<a id="FNanchor_2970" href="#Footnote_2970" class="fnanchor">[2970]</a> Elsewhere he states that certain planets called
superior are especially appropriated to kings, nobles, and
magistrates, while the inferior planets signify concerning the
populace.<a id="FNanchor_2971" href="#Footnote_2971" class="fnanchor">[2971]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Influence
of stars
and signs.</div>

<p>Cecco grants that the celestial bodies are inanimate but
holds that by virtue of their substances and the mediation
of the intelligences moving them they “have properties in
different parts of the sky in which they are said to rejoice
and sadden effectively in us, that is, by disposing us to good
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_957">[Pg 957]</span>
and to evil.”<a id="FNanchor_2972" href="#Footnote_2972" class="fnanchor">[2972]</a> Cecco believes that each herb has its appropriate
planet and sign, and that doctors should be careful
to note the positions of planets in administering herbs.<a id="FNanchor_2973" href="#Footnote_2973" class="fnanchor">[2973]</a> The
parts of the human body and regions of the globe he also
parcels out among the signs.<a id="FNanchor_2974" href="#Footnote_2974" class="fnanchor">[2974]</a> In connection with the common
topic of the influence of the stars upon the formation
of the child in the womb he makes the less common observation
that sometimes the influence of the stars is too strong,
as is seen in the case of infants who talk when only two
months old or have marvelous discretion beyond their years&mdash;or
rather, months&mdash;and die young.<a id="FNanchor_2975" href="#Footnote_2975" class="fnanchor">[2975]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">How
mind
and soul
are affected</div>

<p>The heavens influence the human mind as well as body,
therefore. The stars alter the elements, through these our
bodies, and through these our souls.<a id="FNanchor_2976" href="#Footnote_2976" class="fnanchor">[2976]</a> Certain signs of the
zodiac are called human or rational “because they dispose
man to reason” and “he will possess eloquence mingled with
reason.” A person who is born under one of the vicious and
tortuous signs, namely, the ram, crab, bull, scorpion, and
goat, will have a tortuous and vicious disposition, plotting
evil and detracting from others, such a person as the physician
Gualfridinus, by which name, as Boffito has already
suggested, Dino del Garbo, the noted medical writer of
Florence, is probably indicated. When the moon is in one
of the common signs, Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, or Pisces,
persons who make advances to you are liable to prove fraudulent;
marriages contracted then are liable to be dissolved; if
one escapes from prison, it will be only to be retaken; but
if one is accused of some crime, he will soon be acquitted;
and so on. In some signs secrets will be kept, in others
immediately revealed. When the moon is in the first <i>facies</i>
of Scorpion, all news reports are false.<a id="FNanchor_2977" href="#Footnote_2977" class="fnanchor">[2977]</a> The influence of
the stars explains the puzzling fact, concerning which his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_958">[Pg 958]</span>
fellow-townsmen of Ascoli have often questioned Cecco, why
a man will choose a silly girl of low birth as his wife rather
than another who is more beautiful, noble, and intelligent.
The answer is that when the stars of two persons come into
certain positions relative to each other, love which cannot
be dissolved except by death results, regardless of beauty and
social rank.<a id="FNanchor_2978" href="#Footnote_2978" class="fnanchor">[2978]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The stars
and
dreams.</div>

<p>Cecco also ascribes the prophetic quality of dreams to
astrological influence, which permits the union of the soul
of the dreamer with the superior intelligences or spirits of
the sky. Such revelation is, however, impressed upon the
soul of the dreamer “under some similitude or figure.”
Dreams come true when the moon is in the fixed signs,
Taurus, Leo, Aquarius, and Scorpio; when the moon is in
the common signs, dreams are partly true and partly false.
The length of time to elapse before the dream is fulfilled
can also often be determined. Cecco says that “minds ill-constituted
and false and homicidal do not have true dreams
because they are indisposed to receive the action of the intelligences.”
Robbers and homicides may, however, have
true dreams prophetic of their own deaths as in the tale of
the malefactor, the beetles, and the scythe already recounted,
and in the case of a native of Ascoli whom Cecco knew personally
and “who was named Angelus and consequently was
a devil.” Dreaming when the moon was in Leo that he
would be hanged in Roman territory, he became so frightened
that he turned friar, but after two years was dismissed
from the Order, went to Viterbo, robbed a man, and was
there hanged for it.<a id="FNanchor_2979" href="#Footnote_2979" class="fnanchor">[2979]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Astrological
images.</div>

<p>Cecco alludes to astrological images twice in his commentary
on the <i>De principiis</i> of Alcabitius. To illustrate
how images work which are made as love charms, or to gain
honor, and the like, he states that if an image for purposes
of love is made in the hour of Venus when that planet is in
Pisces or in Taurus, as the tin is poured out it acquires
under the moulding influence of that constellation the due
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_959">[Pg 959]</span>
proportion of the elements essential to produce the desired
property.<a id="FNanchor_2980" href="#Footnote_2980" class="fnanchor">[2980]</a> Later Cecco tells us of an image which Vergil
made at Naples to drive away flies. When the second <i>facies</i>
of Aquarius is in the ascendant an image of a fly should be
engraved on the stone in a ring.<a id="FNanchor_2981" href="#Footnote_2981" class="fnanchor">[2981]</a> In his <i>Commentary on the
Sphere</i> Cecco even goes so far as to tell how to construct an
astronomical image which will enable one to receive responses
from demons.<a id="FNanchor_2982" href="#Footnote_2982" class="fnanchor">[2982]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Did Cecco
deny
human
free will?</div>

<p>Returning to the charges made against Cecco’s astrological
teaching by Villani and the later manuscripts, especially
the assertion that he ascribed necessity to the stars,
we have to note that, although many of the astrological
teachings just listed may seem to ascribe something closely
approaching to necessity to the stars, nevertheless Cecco expressly
asserted that he believed in freedom of the will.
Many of the statements from his commentaries which we
have thus far presented are cited by him from Ptolemy,
Hermes, Zaël and other astrological writers, and perhaps
are not always to be taken as his own opinion, especially
when he quotes Hermes as saying, “The heavens are the
cause of moral virtues and of all.”<a id="FNanchor_2983" href="#Footnote_2983" class="fnanchor">[2983]</a> At any rate he now
informs his students that according to “our and the true
Faith” the circle of the zodiac, “though it may be the cause
of life, yet is not the cause of our will or intellect except as
a tendency (<i>nisi dispositive</i>), and so I hold and truly believe,
although other astrologers hold the contrary, saying
that all things which are generated and corrupted and renovated
in the inferior world of generation and corruption
have efficient causes in the superior world which is ungenerated
and incorruptible.... That argument I will overthrow
in my glosses to the <i>Centiloquium</i>”<a id="FNanchor_2984" href="#Footnote_2984" class="fnanchor">[2984]</a>&mdash;a work by
Cecco which seems to have been lost or never completed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Founders
of new
religions
said to be
born of
incubi and
succubi at
astrological
periods.</div>

<p>The charge that in his <i>Commentary on the Sphere</i> Cecco
said that under certain constellations happy divine men
would be born like Moses, Hermes, Merlin, and Simon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_960">[Pg 960]</span>
Magus, and that Christ and Antichrist were alike under the
rule of the stars, appears from the text of the Commentary
as it has reached us to be an unjust one. Cecco, it is true,
quotes Hipparchus in the book on hierarchies of spirits to
the effect that in the <i>coluri</i>, or circles whose purpose according
to Sacrobosco is to distinguish the solstice and equinox,
there are incubi and succubi by whose virtue there are born
in a major conjunction as if from the deity men who seem
divine and who establish religions in the world and work
miracles. Such a man was Merlin and such an one will be
Antichrist who will be conceived by a virgin and work many
miracles.<a id="FNanchor_2985" href="#Footnote_2985" class="fnanchor">[2985]</a> Of Antichrist Cecco promises to say more at the
close of his lecture and he there quotes a treatise by Zoroaster
on quarter-revolutions of the eighth sphere. According to
this Pseudo-Zoroaster, whenever the eighth sphere completes
one quarter of a revolution, which happens once in twelve
thousand years, there are born by the virtue of incubi and
succubi men supported by divinity who introduce new religions
and by whose death even the heaven is perturbed.
At the end of twelve thousand years the Mosaic law was
terminated thus by the Christian religion, and “ours would
be terminated in this way by Antichrist.”<a id="FNanchor_2986" href="#Footnote_2986" class="fnanchor">[2986]</a> But Cecco does
not necessarily subscribe to these statements of Hipparchus
and Zoroaster. Indeed he has already declared the art of
the latter contrary to the Christian faith and he now continues,
“Whence that beast Zoroaster and some following
him say that Christ was born under the dominion of those
quarter-revolutions from the virtue of incubi and succubi,
of whom I have spoken to you above, but it seems horrible
to me even to write such words.”<a id="FNanchor_2987" href="#Footnote_2987" class="fnanchor">[2987]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Birth of
Christ and
darkness
during His
passion
were both
miraculous.</div>

<p>Cecco goes on to affirm that “Christ our Lord” was the
true son of God who came into the glorious Virgin and was
not made by the nature of the celestial bodies. That He
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_961">[Pg 961]</span>
rather was the Maker of celestial natures many things show
us. One is that the Magi, who were superior astrologers
and acquainted with the secrets of universal nature, adored
him as king and son of God, seeing this in the star which
appeared to them with the figure of a crowned child beneath
it.<a id="FNanchor_2988" href="#Footnote_2988" class="fnanchor">[2988]</a> Cecco also argues that the period of darkness during
Christ’s passion was a true miracle and not due to a natural
eclipse, nor to the interposition of a comet called Milex, nor
to the occult virtue of the stone heliotrope. The comet Milex
is supposed to presage religious change and injury to kings
and potentates, but Cecco argues that its interposition would
not cut off the sun’s light and further that it is not found at
the altitude necessary to interpose. The stone heliotrope is
green with blood-colored drops, and when it is placed in a
shell full of water in the rays of the sun, vapors arise from it
which obscure the horizon in that city. Cecco does not dispute
this occult virtue in the gem, which is commonly called
“orfanella” and which renders a man invisible by affecting
the eyes of others. But he argues that the eclipse during
Christ’s passion was universal and not confined to the city
of Jerusalem. Some say that an interposition of Venus
and Mercury caused the darkness, but Cecco affirms that
this would be astronomically impossible and in itself a
miracle and subversion of natural order. Cecco, however,
adds that while miraculous, the eclipse was also in a sense
natural, since God is the First and Universal Cause and can
alter the heavens which are a secondary universal cause.<a id="FNanchor_2989" href="#Footnote_2989" class="fnanchor">[2989]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Christian
qualification
of Albumasar.</div>

<p>Cecco also pretends that where Albumasar speaks of
<i>creatio</i> as the work of the stars, he must really mean <i>generatio</i>,
since the act of creation pertains to God alone, although
generation is under the stars.<a id="FNanchor_2990" href="#Footnote_2990" class="fnanchor">[2990]</a> As for Albumasar’s
aphorism, “If anyone asks anything of God when the head
of the dragon is in conjunction with Jupiter and the moon in
mid-sky, his prayer will be fulfilled”&mdash;which Peter of
Abano said he had tested twice with success; Cecco declares
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_962">[Pg 962]</span>
that it is not proper to interpret this as meaning that prayers
to God will be infallibly answered in certain constellations,
but that the word <i>deus</i> is to be taken here as indicating the
king or other chief magistrate in the state.<a id="FNanchor_2991" href="#Footnote_2991" class="fnanchor">[2991]</a> Thus Cecco
seems at considerable pains to say nothing that might be
offensive to the church, and he closes his <i>Commentary on
the Sphere</i> with the statement that if in it or other writings
of his aught is found to criticize, he will gladly submit it to
the correction of the very holy Roman church. Possibly
this remark and others like it represent a revision of his
works undertaken after his first condemnation at Bologna.
According to one of the late manuscripts,<a id="FNanchor_2992" href="#Footnote_2992" class="fnanchor">[2992]</a> Cecco, when summoned
before the Inquisition at Florence, claimed that his
book had been corrected by the inquisitor of Lombardy.
This defense was not allowed, however, and the terms of
the sentence at Bologna would seem to preclude it. And
since the sentence given at Florence absolutely forbade anyone
to possess the book, there does not seem much reason
why a revised rather than the original version should survive.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cecco’s
astrology
not the
most
extreme.</div>

<p>On the whole, then, it would be surprising if Cecco’s
condemnation were due merely or primarily to his astrological
teachings. As Tiraboschi<a id="FNanchor_2993" href="#Footnote_2993" class="fnanchor">[2993]</a> noted nearly one hundred
and fifty years ago, he upholds human free will, though
attributing to the stars a natural inclination to vice or virtue,
and holding other superstitions common to the astrologers
of his time. Tiraboschi also noted his submissive tone to
the church and was unable to see in the <i>Commentary on the
Sphere</i> the errors which had been charged to Cecco’s account.
More than this, in a number of respects Cecco did
not go as far as some of his predecessors or subsequent
writers. Christ and Antichrist had been partially subjected
to the stars by writers before him who do not seem to have
been assailed by the Inquisition for their views, and Pierre
d’Ailly, the great cardinal and reformer, went much farther
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_963">[Pg 963]</span>
in this direction than Cecco in the next century. Peter of
Abano had held views concerning the influence of the constellations
on the appearance of new religions and on prayers
to God which Cecco rejects. But all in vain the concessions
made to the Christian standpoint by Cecco at the expense of
astrological doctrine; of him alone we know surely that
he was condemned by the Inquisition, and he went to the
stake.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Charge
that he
taught astrological
necromancy.</div>

<p>We have not yet, however, discussed Villani’s charge
that in his <i>Commentary on the Sphere</i> Cecco asserted that
there were evil spirits generated in the sky who could be
coerced by incantations under certain constellations to perform
many marvels. Villani perhaps has reference to the
passage in which Cecco gives astronomical directions to be
followed by anyone who wishes to make an image by means
of which he may receive responses from spirits.<a id="FNanchor_2994" href="#Footnote_2994" class="fnanchor">[2994]</a> There is
indeed a good deal of information concerning spirits in
the heavens in Cecco’s commentary on Sacrobosco’s manual,
and he shows a wide acquaintance with books of magic.
We turn, therefore, from his astrology proper to his attitude
to magic and to astrological necromancy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His
attitude
toward
magic.</div>

<p>Cecco’s attitude to magic so-called is the usual one of
condemnation. He repeats that Zoroaster was “the first
inventor of the magic art,” and gives a classification of the
magic arts almost identical with that of Hugh of Saint
Victor, but states that he derives it from the <i>Liber de vinculo
spiritus</i> of Hipparchus, a book of necromancy. Cecco says
that magic is “emphatically censured by holy mother
church,”<a id="FNanchor_2995" href="#Footnote_2995" class="fnanchor">[2995]</a> and he does not directly question or qualify this
condemnation. He says nothing of a natural magic which
is harmless. His chief concern with magic, as in the cases
of Michael Scot and Peter of Abano, seems to be to distinguish
astrology from it as a reputable science, and to hold
that one can learn of the future better as well as more
legitimately by astrology.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_964">[Pg 964]</span></p>
<div class="sidenote">His frequent
citation
of
books of
magic and
necromancy.</div>

<p>The fact, however, that the church disapproves of magic
and “vituperates” it, does not restrain Cecco from frequent
citation of books of magic, such as the <i>Liber artis magicae</i>
of Apollonius,<a id="FNanchor_2996" href="#Footnote_2996" class="fnanchor">[2996]</a> nor from retailing to his students much information
concerning spirits in the sky and necromancy.
Thus when Sacrobosco mentions the four points of the compass,
Cecco is reminded of a statement in the <i>Liber de ordine
intelligentiarum</i> of Hipparchus that certain princes of the
demons “occupy the four parts beneath the sky. For expelled
from heaven, they occupy the air and the four elements.”<a id="FNanchor_2997" href="#Footnote_2997" class="fnanchor">[2997]</a>
When Sacrobosco speaks of the zenith and poles
in a purely astronomical way, Cecco again quotes Hipparchus
as saying, “O wonderful zenith and godlike nature,”<a id="FNanchor_2998" href="#Footnote_2998" class="fnanchor">[2998]</a>
etc., after the manner of an invocation, and Solomon in the
<i>Liber de umbris idearum</i> as exclaiming, “O arctic Manes!
O antarctics propelled by divinity! Why do natures so great
and noble seem to be enclosed in mineral species?” This
last remark, Cecco explains, refers to the responses given
by these spirits in metal mirrors.<a id="FNanchor_2999" href="#Footnote_2999" class="fnanchor">[2999]</a> When Sacrobosco treats
of climates, Cecco remarks that the word may be understood
necromantically as well as astronomically. Zoroaster, the
inventor of the magic art, uses the word in the necromantic
sense when he says, “For those climates are to be marveled
at, which with flesh of corpses and human blood give responses
trustworthily.” “By this,” continues Cecco, “you
should understand those four spirits of great virtue who
stand <i>in cruciatis locis</i>, that is, in east, west, north, and
south, whose names are Oriens, Amaymon, Paymon, and
Egim,<a id="FNanchor_3000" href="#Footnote_3000" class="fnanchor">[3000]</a> spirits who are of the major hierarchy and who have
under them twenty-five legions of spirits each. Therefore
because of their noble nature these seek sacrifice from human
blood and likewise from the flesh of a dead man or cat.<a id="FNanchor_3001" href="#Footnote_3001" class="fnanchor">[3001]</a>
But this Zoroastrian art cannot be carried on without great
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_965">[Pg 965]</span>
peril, fastings, prayers, and all things which are contrary
to our Faith.”<a id="FNanchor_3002" href="#Footnote_3002" class="fnanchor">[3002]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Necromancy
employs
evil
spirits.</div>

<p>This last word of warning may seem a bit belated and
perhaps somewhat perfunctory, but shows Cecco still consistent
in recognizing that magic and necromancy are contrary
to the Christian religion. In other passages he calls
these spirits demons and diabolical,<a id="FNanchor_3003" href="#Footnote_3003" class="fnanchor">[3003]</a> and affirms with Augustine
that “spirits who are outside the order of grace” cannot
truly transmute bodies, nor raise the dead, nor do any
marvels and feats of magic except those which can be accounted
for by the occult virtues of nature.<a id="FNanchor_3004" href="#Footnote_3004" class="fnanchor">[3004]</a> And in speaking
of a demon named Floron, who was mentioned by Solomon
in the <i>Book of the Shadows of Ideas</i>, who was of the
hierarchy of cherubim, who was confined in a steel mirror
by a major invocation, who knew many secrets of nature,
and who deceived King Manfred and others by ambiguous
oracles in modern times,&mdash;Cecco concludes, “So beware of
these demons because their ultimate intention is to deceive
Christians to the discredit of our Lord Jesus Christ.” Cecco
tells a story of a man of Ferrara who consulted this demon
Floron as to hidden treasure and was told that he would
find enough in a certain spot to last him for the rest of his
life. He dug in the cavern indicated and uncovered only
four ounces of gold, but as an avalanche crushed him immediately
afterward, the oracle was fulfilled.<a id="FNanchor_3005" href="#Footnote_3005" class="fnanchor">[3005]</a> Yet on the
next page we find Cecco giving the instructions already mentioned
for making an astronomical image in order to obtain
responses from a spirit. And several pages further on he
cites a response of this same Floron as to the time when
demons are least liable to deceive one and when as a consequence
it is best to consult them, and again as to the divinity
of Christ, of whom this demon Floron said, “He took upon
Him human flesh that all flesh through Him might be
saved.”<a id="FNanchor_3006" href="#Footnote_3006" class="fnanchor">[3006]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_966">[Pg 966]</span></p><div class="sidenote">Cecco unduly
curious
rather
than
heretical
in this
regard.</div>

<p>Thus, much of Cecco’s work seems less a commentary
upon Sacrobosco’s text than a manual of astrological necromancy.
His citations from the books of magic and
necromancy well illustrate those relations between astronomy,
magic, and necromancy to which we have before
had allusions in the writings of Albertus Magnus and elsewhere.
We remember the distinction drawn in the <i>Speculum
astronomiae</i> between commendable works of astronomy
and injurious works of necromancy, and we wonder if the
cause of Cecco’s condemnation may not have been that instead
of sticking to the field of astrology he made these dangerous
excursions into the subject of necromancy. It might
well be held that he was leading his students into temptation
by the numerous references to demons, the magic art, and
astrological necromancy in his <i>Commentary on the Sphere</i>.
At the same time it must be remembered that such pillars
of the Christian Faith and learning as William of Auvergne
and Albertus Magnus had read and cited books of magic
and necromancy. Cecco’s passages concerning astrological
necromancy are almost all quotations or citations from other
authors. When he speaks in his own name it is usually to
declare magic and necromancy contrary to Christianity and
to censure the passages which he has just cited. Moreover,
the notion of hierarchies of spirits, of their presence in sky
and air and elements, of their power to work marvels,&mdash;all
these were orthodox enough Christian doctrines. And
Cecco does not, like William and Albert, hint at a natural
variety of magic apart from demons which is not idolatrous
and unchristian. Of indiscreet curiosity concerning such
matters and undue mention of them he might be found guilty,
but scarcely of any direct heresy so far as his extant written
works are concerned.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Was
Cecco’s
death due
to personal
enemies?</div>

<p>If neither Cecco’s astrology nor his citation of books
of magic and necromancy seems sufficiently extreme to account
alone for his condemnation by the Inquisition, we
may perhaps find the clue in the hypothesis of personal
enemies, which has already been more than once advanced
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_967">[Pg 967]</span>
by writers on Cecco. That he would have made bitter personal
enemies one can well imagine from the sharp personalities
in which he indulges in his works. That such
personalities were not unwelcome to the taste of that time,
however, is indicated by Dante’s frequent allusions to the
recent dead in his <i>Inferno</i>. Cecco with less discretion directed
his gibes against the living. Thus he states that the
head and tail of the dragon are the intersections of circles,
and not stars forming the shape of a dragon in the sky “as
a certain physician of ours of Ascoli (?) argued together
with his mother who was as big a fool as himself.”<a id="FNanchor_3007" href="#Footnote_3007" class="fnanchor">[3007]</a> We
have already mentioned Cecco’s insulting words concerning
the physician Gualfridinus, who seems the same as Dino del
Garbo. Now while Villani tells us that Cecco attributed his
arrest at Florence to the chancellor of the duke, in the very
next chapter, in mentioning the death of Master Dino del
Garbo, whom he calls a very celebrated physician and a man
learned in natural science and philosophy, who wrote “several
noble books” at the request of King Robert of Naples,
Villani adds that Dino “was a great cause of Cecco’s death,
attacking as erroneous the book from which he had lectured
at Bologna; and many said that he did this through
envy.”<a id="FNanchor_3008" href="#Footnote_3008" class="fnanchor">[3008]</a> Padre Appiani, a Jesuit who wrote an apology
for Cecco in the seventeenth century, attributed his persecution
at Bologna to the son, Tommaso del Garbo, and
that at Florence to Dino.<a id="FNanchor_3009" href="#Footnote_3009" class="fnanchor">[3009]</a> Tiraboschi in the eighteenth century
came to the conclusion that “envy had no small part
in the condemnation of this unhappy astrologer, and that he
would not have perished so wretchedly if he had not had
powerful enemies who conspired to his ruin.”<a id="FNanchor_3010" href="#Footnote_3010" class="fnanchor">[3010]</a> Nothing is
said by Villani of Cecco’s having offended the duke of Florence,
Charles of Calabria, and so forfeited his favor and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_968">[Pg 968]</span>
protection, but this would seem likely, though of course it
would account only for his second sentence at Florence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His execution
of
little significance.</div>

<p>The condemnation of Cecco, therefore, may be a good
example of the way in which the Inquisition could be manipulated
for private ends, but it does not seem a sign of any
general attack by the church and Inquisition on astrology
or on learned men who showed an interest in occult science.
The charges repeated, or invented, against Cecco by Villani
and the late manuscripts are loose and exaggerated. Why
Cecco d’Ascoli was burned at the stake is a problem that has
puzzled more than one investigator, and none of the explanations
offered is entirely satisfactory. It is, however,
fairly evident that the process against Cecco was a failure
as an attempt to check his teachings and simply advertised
him and his writings. It came late in the medieval period
and apparently was not soon repeated. Everything tends to
indicate that his execution was an exceptional and sensational,
but not especially significant event. The attitudes
toward astrology of Thomas Aquinas, whom the church
canonized, and of Albertus Magnus, who was beatified, are
much more important and more characteristic of medieval
ecclesiastical culture.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">The end
of our
period.</div>

<p>Our survey of some thirteen centuries of thought draws to
a close. As has been said in discussing Peter of Abano, the
period of the medieval revival of learning, as of other phases
of civilization, seems to have spent its force by the close of
the first quarter of the fourteenth century. On the other
hand, the works which we have studied were reproduced
again and again in manuscript form in the fourteenth and
fifteenth centuries and then in printed form in the fifteenth
and sixteenth centuries, as has been pointed out in many
instances. Some topics, like that of experimental books,
we have traced on as late as into the seventeenth century.
In short, the conceptions whose prevalence we have depicted
in some detail for thirteen centuries of thought continued
to have weight for a long time thereafter. On the occult
and magical side, moreover, later writers like Henry Cornelius
Agrippa, Trithemius, or Cardan were to add little or
nothing to what had been often repeated before. In the
field of experimental science, on the other hand, a period of
greater progress came later. Gradually, too,&mdash;very gradually
it would seem until almost our own time&mdash;scepticism
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_970">[Pg 970]</span>
was to come to prevail among scientists as to the possibility
of magic in any of its forms in the world of nature. A
great task still awaits him who shall trace the slow rise of
effective scepticism through such writings against astrology
as those of Nicholas Oresme in the fourteenth, and Pico
della Mirandola, who at the same time believed in magic,
in the fifteenth century, and in such criticisms of pseudo-science
in general as Sir Thomas Browne’s <i>History of Vulgar
Errors</i> in the seventeenth century;<a id="FNanchor_3011" href="#Footnote_3011" class="fnanchor">[3011]</a> and likewise the
gradual dislodgment of the conception of occult virtue and
influence by that of natural law through the disclosure of
many of nature’s former secrets by scientific instruments
and research.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Science
not stagnant
during
it.</div>

<p>However, the disclosure of such secrets had already
begun when the period of our investigation opened and it
continued during our period of thirteen centuries, which
was no such age of retrogression or stagnation as it has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_971">[Pg 971]</span>
formerly been depicted. The ideas and discoveries of
Hellenic, not to say oriental, science persisted and were preserved
by medieval men to a greater extent than has been
generally recognized; and to them the medieval men added
questions, observations, and even discoveries of their own.
Not only did curiosity concerning nature’s secrets continue,
but the authority of the ancients was often received with
scepticism; and a marked tendency runs through our period
to rely upon rationalism and experimental method. I have
exposed the <i>Physiologus</i> myth, the <i>Florilegia</i> myth, the
legend of Roger Bacon as a lone herald of modern experimental
science, the notion that Vincent of Beauvais adequately
sums up all medieval science, and a number of other
modern “vulgar errors” concerning medieval learning. I
have shown that medieval men were wider readers than has
often been thought, that the scholastics presented their material
in a more systematic way than classical writers, that
the Latin of the thirteenth century has a clearer style and
shows more direct thinking than the vernaculars of the fifteenth
century. Should we, moreover, go on to examine in
detail the writings of the early modern centuries, I suspect
that we would find them repeating the medieval authors just
as these had repeated the classical authorities. Gesner, for
instance, in his <i>History of Animals</i>, 1551-1587, copied Albertus
Magnus as well as Aristotle. And of the scientific
notions with which the men of the sixteenth century have
been credited by their admirers many might be found on
closer scrutiny and comparison to date back to classical or
medieval authors.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nor a
mere
handmaid
of religion.</div>

<p>Nor can I agree that natural science in the middle ages,
as has been said of medieval philosophy, was a mere handmaid
of religion. Friar Bacon pointed out, it is true, how
experimental science might serve the Church, but he also
wished the Church to advance the study of science. And
in many ways the Church did so, while its opposition to
scientific research at that time has been grossly exaggerated.
It is true that the Biblical and Christian conception of a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_972">[Pg 972]</span>
created universe was generally accepted, but the Aristotelian
and astrological conception of the heavenly bodies as eternal
and incorruptible was scarcely less influential, and many
writers held both conceptions, however inconsistent this may
seem to us. We have met with some extreme instances of
the religious point of view affecting the attitude toward
nature, notably the idea that human sin affects or even upsets
the course of nature; but we have also seen that the
moralizing and allegorizing supposed to characterize medieval
nature-study have been greatly over-estimated. For
ancient pagans like Pliny and Seneca the study of nature
seems to have taken the place of religion in large measure,
but the introduction of Christianity did not result in the
discontinuance or estoppal of the study of nature, nor in its
reduction to a state of servitude. Medieval science was
somewhat under the wing of the Church, as were so many
other activities now purely secular, but science even in the
middle ages was learning to use its own wings. Both in
Mohammedan and Christian society profane learning in
general and science in particular made progress, and the
remains of Arabic science would be much scantier than they
are, were it not for the fact that many works are preserved
solely in Latin translations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The belief
in occult
virtue.</div>

<p>But many secrets of nature still remained undiscovered
in our period, and hence it is not surprising that the conception
of occult virtue in nature, of occult influence exerted
by animals, herbs, and gems, or by stars and spirits,
still prevailed to such an extent among men of the highest
scientific attainments then possible. How potent this conception
was, has been shown by the continued use of amulets,
of ligatures and suspensions, by the general belief in fascination,
physiognomy, number mysticism, and divination
from dreams. Some still countenanced the occult force of
words, figures, characters, and images, or of this and that
rite, ceremonial, and form. Especially surprising is the
prevalence of lot-casting under the pseudo-scientific form
of geomancy. But others had begun to doubt the efficacy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_973">[Pg 973]</span>
of some or most of these things. Animism had pretty much
had its day; necromancy and the notory art received relatively
little attention, although the Church appears to have
rather encouraged them by insisting upon the existence and
power of evil spirits. But even the fathers and theologians
made the point that demons work their marvels largely
through their superior knowledge of natural forces. Much
more in science and medicine have we seen the notion of
spiritual force displaced by that of occult natural virtue, and
use made of natural substances rather than of incantations.
Some of our authors would explain the results achieved by
incantations entirely by the force of suggestion. Of the
later witchcraft delusion which overpowered the learned as
well as the populace we have found relatively few harbingers.
The discussion of sorcery and witchcraft has been less in
our medieval than in our ancient authors, and less among
our scientists than among our theologians. The subject has
been broached chiefly in connection with formal definitions
of magic arts or the practical problem of impotency after
marriage.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dominance
of
astrology.</div>

<p>We have also repeatedly seen magic itself becoming more
scientific or pseudo-scientific in method and appearance.
This is well illustrated by the fact that in our authors of the
twelfth and thirteenth centuries astrology is the most widespread,
as it is the most pseudo-scientific of any variety of the
magic arts. Indeed, it has ceased to be merely one method
of divination and claims to study and disclose the universal
law of nature in the rule of the stars, by which every fact
in nature and every occult influence in magic may be explained.
If this doctrine were true, all other sciences and
magic arts would be reduced to branches of the supreme
science and art of astronomy or astrology. But it is not
true, and hence I prefer to classify astrology as a magic art
along with other arts of divination. And this brings us
back to the question of the definition of magic.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Definition
of magic.</div>

<p>The results of this investigation seem to me to have
justified the selection of the word, “magic,” as a generic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_974">[Pg 974]</span>
term to include all superstitious arts and occult sciences, and
to designate a great primary division or phase of human
thought and activity. Magic is subordinate to no other
superstition or occult art; they are more often regarded as
subdivisions of it. The attempts of some of our authors
to distinguish between magic and astrology, or magic and
divination, or good and bad magic, or natural magic and
sorcery, or witchcraft and counter-magic, have all been exceedingly
illogical and unconvincing. Magic appears, in
our period at least, as a way of looking at the world which
is reflected in a human art or group of arts employing
varied materials in varied rites, often fantastic, to work a
great variety of marvelous results, which offer man a release
from his physical, social, and intellectual limitations,
not by the imaginative and sentimental methods of music,
melodrama, fiction, and romance, or by religious experience
or asceticism, but by operations supposed to be efficacious
here in the world of external reality. Some writers, chiefly
theologians, lay great stress on resort to spirits in magic,
some upon the influence of the heavens, some on both these
forces, which yet others almost identify; but, except as theological
dogma insists upon the demoniacal character of
magic, or as astrological doctrine insists on the rule of the
stars, it cannot be said that spirits or stars are thought of
as always necessary in magic. The <i>sine qua non</i> seems to
be a human operator, materials, rites, and an aim that borders
on the impossible, either in itself, such as predicting the
future or curing incurable diseases or becoming invisible, or
in relation to the apparently inadequate means employed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Difficulty
of reducing
magic
to one
principle.</div>

<p>In our authors it has been difficult to account for the
particular occult properties attributed to things and acts,
or to detect any one underlying principle, such as sympathy,
symbolism, imitation, contagion, resemblance, or association,
guiding the selection of materials and rites for
magic. This is either because there never was such a principle,
and magic from the start was empirical and complex,
or because we deal with a late stage in its development, when
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_975">[Pg 975]</span>
the superstitions of different peoples have coalesced, when
the peculiar customs of folk-lore have become confused with
those of science and religion, after the primitive methods
of magic have been artificially over-elaborated, and after
many usages have become gradually corrupted and their
original meaning has been forgotten. Whether magic is
good or evil, true or false, is with our authors a matter of
opinion, in which the majority hold it to be true but evil.
Every shade of opinion is represented, however; but furthermore
few can avoid a wholesome feeling that there is
something false about magic somewhere. This sounds the
signal, as it were, for magic’s doom.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Human
fondness
for the
fallacious.</div>

<p>However, I suspect that it is not so much that magic
has been shown to be false, as it is that men have come to
set a greater value upon truth, that accounts for magic’s
decline. As I survey the practice and “beliefs” of primitive
and savage tribes or the columns of modern newspapers and
much of modern literature, I become convinced that
men have a natural tendency to assert, and craving to hear
the sensational, exaggerated, and impossible, and to fly in
the face both of reason and experience. People take pleasure
in affirming the extravagant and in believing the incredible,
in saying that they have seen or done what no one else has
seen or done. Cows, for instance, seldom or never burst,
as everyone knows perfectly well, primitive man probably
better than civilized; that is what makes it interesting to
mention circumstances under which they will burst. “Lord,
I believe, help Thou my unbelief,” is a good picture of the
mental attitude supporting much of magic, which may be
not so much a matter of belief as of make-believe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Utility
is not
magic’s
strongest
appeal.</div>

<p>To turn from “belief” to practice, I suspect that much
magic is done from want of anything better or else to do,
rather than from complete conviction of its efficacy. When
Pamphile in the pages of Apuleius anointed herself from
top to toe in order to turn into an owl, it was because this
was the best way of which she could think to enable herself
to fly far, far away. But had an airplane been at hand, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_976">[Pg 976]</span>
fancy she would have had more confidence in it for purposes
of flight. Inventions in artificial lighting have probably
done more than sermons, arguments, and laws to dispel
the works of darkness with which magicians whiled away
the night-time. Had electric light been invented in Pamphile’s
age, she would probably have spent her evenings in
jazz or at a movie. It was probably not during the hunting
season that cave-men drew their magic pictures of wild boars
and bulls. The telepathy practiced by savages in war and
hunting<a id="FNanchor_3012" href="#Footnote_3012" class="fnanchor">[3012]</a> is perhaps less from firm faith in its potency than
because the women left at home want to do something and
to share somehow in the crucial operations, and furthermore
are expected “to do their bit” by the men in the
field. Perhaps such telepathic magic had almost as great
actual efficacy toward its end as some of the desperate
expedients, prompted more by patriotic emotion than discreet
calculation, which were adopted to help “win the war”
or to “maintain morale” by those who stayed at home during
the recent great conflict. I should doubt if most men
ever believed that rain falls only as a result of magic. It
seems more likely that they are aware that the rain will
come some time, and hence are ready to do almost anything
which may hurry it up or relieve their own feelings and
inaction in the meantime. As no modern scientist has
brought to their attention any more efficacious method of
altering the weather, they continue their time-honored rite
regardless of our jeers. It does as well as any. But where
some prehistoric genius introduced artificial irrigation, rainmaking
magic probably promptly declined in popularity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The spirit
of magic
is not the
scientific
spirit.</div>

<p>In the case of rain-making there is evidently much truth
in Sir James Frazer’s statement that “the fallacy of magic
is not easy to detect, because nature herself generally produces
sooner or later the effects which the magician fancies
he produces by his art.”<a id="FNanchor_3013" href="#Footnote_3013" class="fnanchor">[3013]</a> But the dictum cannot be
stretched to cover magic in general. In some cases the
fallacy of magic is all too evident, but men love it, or there
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_977">[Pg 977]</span>
is as yet no truth discovered to take its place. Rational
scepticism is needed to dispel the former; repeated experiment,
to arrive at the latter. Believers in and practitioners
of magic probably at no time in its history either even flattered
themselves on so sound a basis of theory, or were
so severely practical in their aims and methods, as not to
delight in the marvelous and incredible and impossible for
their own sake. Rather in providing or attempting to provide
for practical wants and emergencies, considerations of
credibility and possibility often were apt to be cast to the
winds. Thus the spirit of magic is different from the
scientific spirit.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Magic and
experimental
science.</div>

<p>Yet our material has conclusively shown that the history
of magic is bound up with the history of science as well
as with folk-lore, primitive culture, and the history of religion.
Sometimes our authors have spoken of natural
magic, but I rather wonder whether there could well be
any other kind, since man must always reckon with his
natural environment. It is not without reason that the
Magi stand out in Pliny’s pages not as mere sorcerers or
enchanters but as those who have gone farthest and in most
detail&mdash;too curiously, in his opinion&mdash;into the study of
nature. It is not without reason that we have found experimentation
and magic so constantly associated throughout
our period. After all it is not surprising that magic, which
was both curious and tried to accomplish things, should investigate
nature and should experiment. It is even possible
that magicians were the first to experiment, or shared
that province with the first inventors and the useful arts,
and that natural science, originally philosophical and speculative,
took over experimental method in a crude form, as
well as the conception of occult virtue, from magic. As Sir
James Frazer has said, “Here is a body of men relieved, at
least in the higher stages of savagery, from the need of
earning their livelihood by hard manual toil, and allowed,
nay, expected and encouraged, to prosecute researches into
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_978">[Pg 978]</span>
the secret ways of nature.”<a id="FNanchor_3014" href="#Footnote_3014" class="fnanchor">[3014]</a> It is therefore perhaps not
surprising that men like Galen, Apuleius, Apollonius, and
Dunstan were accused of magic by their contemporaries;
that men like Gerbert, Michael Scot, and Albertus Magnus
were represented as magicians in later, if not contemporary
legend; that <i>Lithica</i> and Roger Bacon tell us of the danger
of sages being accused of magic; that the <i>Book of Enoch</i>,
Cyprian, Firmicus, and Picatrix confuse magic with other
arts and sciences; and that no one of our authors, try as he
may, succeeds in keeping magic entirely out of science or
science entirely out of magic.</p>

creation.</div>

<p>Be that as it may, if the anthropologists are correct in
asserting that magic forms a great part of the life and
thought of early man and of all primitive peoples, it is evident
that only gradually would the science and thought of
civilized peoples free themselves from the old habits and
instincts. Modern science cannot exempt itself from its
own theory of evolution as Julius Firmicus exempted the
Roman emperor from the rule of the stars. Science did not
come down from above nor invade from without. It grew
up in the very midst of superstition and mental anarchy,
just as the states of modern Europe had their beginnings
in feudal society. As the kings in the middle ages had to
govern under feudal limitations and even by feudal means,
so science for a long time not merely was opposed by the
unscientific attitude, but was itself tinged by fantastic
theories and false data. It is scarcely a paradox to say that
during our Roman and medieval period the laws of magic
were better defined and understood than those of science.
Yet the scientific attitude, like the spirit of nationality, was
at work in the seeming chaos; gradually it shook itself free
from error, and, by the increasing application of truly scientific
methods, won a similar triumph to that which the sovereign
political power gained by its gradual development
of governmental institutions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its
medieval
stage of
development.</div>

<p>This was the process going on in the twelfth and thirteenth
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_979">[Pg 979]</span>
centuries. When men still believed in demons and
witches and divination from dreams, it is not surprising
that they believed also in natural magic. Only a small part
of nature’s secrets were revealed to them; of the rest they
felt that almost anything might turn out to be true. It was
a time when “one vast realm of wonder spreads around.”
They had to struggle against a huge burden of error and
superstition which Greece and Rome and the Arabs handed
down to them; yet they must try to assimilate what was of
value in Aristotle, Galen, Pliny, Ptolemy, and the rest. Crude
naïve beginners they were in many respects. Yet they show
an interest in nature and its problems; they are drawing the
line between science and religion; they make some progress
in mathematics, geography, physics and chemistry; they not
only talk about experimental method, they actually make
some inventions and discoveries of use in the future advance
of science. Moreover, they themselves feel that they are
making progress. They do not hesitate to disagree with
their ancient authorities, when they know something better.
Roger Bacon affirms that many scientific facts and truths are
known in his time of which Plato and Aristotle, Hippocrates
and Galen, were ignorant. The ancients, says Peter of Spain
in effect, were philosophers, but we are experimenters. Magic
still lingers but the march of modern science has begun.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Does
magic survive
in
modern
learning?</div>

<p>Are there other sides of our life and thought to-day where
magic still lingers and no such march as that of modern natural
and experimental science has been begun or progressed
so far? We fear that there are. One can well imagine that
a future age may regard much of the learning even of our
time as almost as futile, superstitious, fantastic in method,
and irrelevant to the ends sought, as were primitive man’s
methods of producing rain, Egyptian amulets to cure disease,
or medieval blood-letting according to the phases of
the moon. Ptolemy believed in astrology, but how many
archaeologists and philologists and students of early religion
and mythology and folk-lore there are who fail to observe
his great law that one should always adopt the simplest possible
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_980">[Pg 980]</span>
hypothesis consistent with the observed facts! How
some ransack the latest and remotest sources for some one
brief annotation by a scholiast that may support some ingenious
theory concerning the earliest origins of a language,
a cult, or a deity,&mdash;which theory too often has only this to
recommend it, that no one has ever thought of it before!
How to prove a point concerning some single country and
restricted period they bring together word-forms, coins,
fragments of vases, customs, and folk-tales from the most
outlandish regions and widely separated eras, and pile up a
huge collection of most erudite looking footnotes, full of
abbreviated formulae denoting German periodicals which
have all the appearance of the unintelligible jargon of some
ancient incantation! As one reflects upon the respect and
admiration with which such “scholarship” and “research”
is regarded by many in our own time, can one wonder that
in the middle ages and antiquity the pharmacist who added
to his compound herb after herb from India and other romantic
lands, or part after part from the carcasses of fabulous
animals, in a frantic effort to improve upon a remedy
that was wrong to start with,&mdash;can one wonder if he was
hailed in his day as a discoverer and public benefactor, if
his compound was copied in book after book and century
after century, and, while he perhaps had devised it against
some one ailment, if it came in time to be regarded as a
panacea for all ills? How many historical generalizations,
which originated in superficial association of ideas on
no sounder a basis than that supposed by some to lie behind
magic, are not only still current, but are glibly and unquestioningly
assumed as themselves a basis for what might
otherwise be considered truly scientific investigation of more
detailed and less important points!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Or in
other sides
of present
life?</div>

<p>We might carry our comparison from the world of
scholarship, which at least displays industry and ingenuity
in its superstitions, to the cruder and lazier conceptions and
assumptions of social and civil life. Often enough has the
connection of religion with magic been pointed out, but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_981">[Pg 981]</span>
what side of life is there that is free from it? If not sheer
intolerance, what else than survivals or revivals of ritual
are all those conventions of dress and etiquette which are
supposed to distinguish ladies and gentlemen from their
fellow human beings? “Good form” is one of the last lines
of trenches by which stupidity endeavors to hold its conquest
or inheritance or&mdash;shall we say?&mdash;native soil of respectability.
And how much we are forced to hear of literary
or of social charm! Is such charm any less fleeting and
fallacious than the magic charm from which it takes its
name? Does it advance truth or retard civilization? Is
not the man without it, who has to be twice as efficient in
order to secure the same position as the man with it, the
true builder? Does such personal charm add any more to
its possessor’s real value to society than the incantation of
the ancient artisan did to his industrial process? We believe
that it does, but so did he. Or who can marvel at past
belief in the magic power of words, who hears statesmen
speak and millions shout of Militarism, Unconditional Surrender,
Nationality, Democracy, Prohibition, Socialism, and
Bolsheviki? What fears, what hopes, what passions, what
prejudices, what sacrifices these words elicit! And how
little agreement there is as to their meaning! If our illustrations
are somewhat frivolous and superficial, let us
measure the amount of magic in present civilization by
Plotinus’ standard. He who yields to the charms of love
and family affection or seeks political power or aught else
than Truth and true beauty, or even he who searches for
beauty in inferior things; he who is deceived by appearances,
he who follows irrational inclinations, is as truly bewitched
as if he were the victim of magic and <i>goetia</i> so-called. The
life of reason is alone free from magic. Measuring our
age by such a standard, we shall be tempted to cry out,
Magic of magics, all is magic! What else is there to write
about?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Importance
of
the history
of experimental
science.</div>

<p>At least one thing, and that is experimental science.
“It always is making acquisitions and never grows less; it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_982">[Pg 982]</span>
ever elevates and never degenerates; it is always clear and
never conceals itself.” Of its relations to magic through
some thirteen centuries of thought I have deemed it worth
while to attempt a somewhat detailed picture in the foregoing
pages, presenting not only a survey of occult science
but of the lives and writings of some pioneers, now too forgotten,
in science’s earlier and less successful days. Originally
magic alone was the object of my investigation, and
experimental science an unexpected by-product which forced
its importance during our period increasingly upon the attention.
For this reason, while the magic of the learned
has perhaps been treated here about as fully as it deserves,
a complete and thorough history of experimental science
through these thirteen centuries has not been attempted, and
much new material in all probability still awaits discovery
in the period of which we have treated. And while I have
not yet had time to do much reading in works of the fourteenth
and fifteenth centuries, I suspect that while the writers
on occult subjects have little or nothing new to say, experimentation
probably continued its evolution and that there
may even be disclosed in obscure writers of that time germs
of some of the discoveries usually ascribed to later and
greater names.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Prominence
of magic in
the history
of science.</div>

<p>On the other hand, I have found little to suggest that
medieval men themselves purposely concealed scientific discoveries
which they had made, although it is true that some
of them believed that the ancients had done this, and although
some of them pretended to do so themselves. Above
all I have demonstrated that when ancient or medieval
authors are apparently superstitious, they are really so, and
that it is far-fetched to attempt to explain such passages as
cryptograms or allegories or flights of poetical imagination
or interpolations or signs of spurious authorship. Our
authors do not intentionally employ occult science to hide
truths of natural science or inventions in applied science.
Rather it is characteristic of magic and occult science to
make a pretense of hidden truth and of marvel-working
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_983">[Pg 983]</span>
which they cannot substantiate. And the fact concerning our
authors has been that they cannot yet consistently discriminate
between occult science and natural science, between
magic and applied science.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How the
human
mind
works.</div>

<p>If this investigation has shed some light on the biographies
and bibliography of past scholars and scientists, on
the textual history and criticism of particular works or the
general condition of the manuscript material, perhaps it has
also supplied data that may prove of value to philosophers
and psychologists in determining the laws of human thought
and our intellectual processes. Instead, say, of giving a
so-called intelligence test to some hundreds of immature
school children to discover which ones are well-nigh imbecile
or idiotic, I have set forth for comparison the mature, carefully
considered thoughts on certain topics of a number of
the world’s intellectual leaders through centuries. We have
seen the same old ideas continually recurring,<a id="FNanchor_3015" href="#Footnote_3015" class="fnanchor">[3015]</a> new ideas
appearing with exceeding slowness, men of the same given
period holding a common stock of notions and being for the
most part in remarkable agreement. Even the most intellectual
men seem to have a limited number of ideas, just as
humanity has a limited number of domesticated animals.
Not only is man unable by taking thought to add one cubit
to his stature, he usually equally fails to add one new idea
to humanity’s small collection. Often men seem to be repeating
the ideas like parrots. And this is not merely patristic,
or scholastic; it is everlastingly human. Yet it has been
evident that some of our authors were more original, resourceful,
ingenious, inquisitive than others. There is curiosity,
occasionally a new question is asked, an old thought
put in a novel way, or a new experiment tried.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Indestructibility
of thought.</div>

<p>As I have pursued this investigation, my wonder has
grown at the number of learned men of whom memory has
been preserved from a distant past even to our day, at the
voluminousness of their extant writings, at the many small
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_984">[Pg 984]</span>
details of their daily life which are known to us. Sometimes
their respective lives and thoughts intertwine and cross and
coincide so that a learned world and society seems to stand
out entire. Moreover, what might be found out concerning
them by exhausting the manuscript material would doubtless
be much greater than scholars have as yet established. At
any rate the records are abundant, more so than for any
other phase of human life except perhaps art; they permit of
detailed examination; no severed fragments or dead bones,
they throb with life. Some species may lay more eggs, or
multiply more rapidly, but manuscripts survive. Neckam’s
book has withstood the worms better than its master, but he,
too, still lives in and through it and his other books. If matter
is indestructible and energy is conserved, may we not
paraphrase Adelard of Bath and say in closing: “And certainly
in my judgment nothing in this world of thought ever
perishes utterly, or is less to-day than when it was created.
If any concept is dissolved from one union, it does not perish
but is joined to some other group.” Magic and experiment
yesterday; science and experiment to-day. Long live
Thought! and may it some day regroup itself into Truth!</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_3011" href="#FNanchor_3011" class="label">[3011]</a> On Nicolas Oresme, Bishop of
Lisieux, see Francis Meunier,
<i>Essai sur la vie et les ouvrages
de Nicole Oresme</i>, Paris, 1857,
where many treatises by him
against astrology are listed, and
Charles Jourdain (1888), pp. 559-587,
<i>Nicholas Oresme et les astrologues
de la cour de Charles
V</i>.</p>

<p>In Sloane 2156, 15th century,
fols. 209v-224, I have read a
treatise by Oresme which Jourdain
does not mention, namely,
<i>Contra conjunctionistas de futurorum
eventibus</i>, copied in 1430.
In BN 10271, fols. 63-153, is a
defense of astrology against
Oresme’s criticisms by John Lauratius
de Fundis, writing at Bologna
in 1451.</p>

<p>For Pico’s twelve books against
astrology, his twenty-six conclusions
concerning magic, and his
<i>Apology</i>, in which he again defends
natural magic, see his works
as published at Venice in 1519 or
1557. He accepts the church’s
condemnation of magic as usually
practiced, but upholds natural
magic. A preliminary paragraph
of praise in these printed editions
credits Pico with having destroyed
astrology root and branch, whereas
after previous attacks it had
sprung up again, but this is exaggerated
praise in view of the
later favorable attitude toward
astrology of such distinguished
astronomers as Kepler and Tycho
Brahe, or rather, it shows that
the “astrology” attacked by Pico
did not comprise everything that
we should classify under that
head. Pico’s attack, such as it
was, was countered by Lucius
Bellantius in a defense of astrology
published in 1502: <i>Defensio
astrologiae contra Ioannem
Picum Mirandulam Lucii Bellantii
Senensis Mathematici ac
Physici Liber de Astrologica

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
